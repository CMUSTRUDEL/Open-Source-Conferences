Title: Linux Powered Autonomous Arctic Buoys - Satish Chetty, Hera Systems
Publication date: 2017-10-24
Playlist: Open Source Summit Europe & Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2017
Description: 
	Linux Powered Autonomous Arctic Buoys - Satish Chetty, Hera Systems

In my talk/presentation, I cover the technical, and design challenges in developing an autonomous Linux powered Arctic buoy. This system is a low cost, COTS based, extreme/harsh environment, autonomous sensor data gathering platform. It measures albedo, weather, water temperature and other parameters. It runs on a custom embedded Linux and is optimized for efficient use of solar & battery power. It uses a variety of low cost, high accuracy/precision sensors and satellite/terrestrial wireless communications. 

I talk about using Linux in this embedded environment, and how I address and solve various issues including building a custom kernel, Linux drivers, frame grabbing issues and results from cameras, limited power challenges, clock drifts due to low temperature, summer melt challenges, failure of sensors, intermittent communication issues and various other h/w & s/w challenges.

hello my name is Satish Satish Shetty

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:13,049
I'm actually got a few more minutes to

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,519
start but I think I'll start anyway

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,160
gives me a few minutes to answer your

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,480
questions if you have any my name is

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,189
Satish Eddy I'm actually pretty

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,289
surprised and happy that you guys are

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,180
all here there's another interesting doc

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,939
going on and I thought that I wouldn't

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,519
have so much coverage anyway so this is

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,900
a strange topic and I wanted to give

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,180
some background before we go further

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,739
into it that's me standing in front of

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,920
the Arctic Ocean that's all frozen and

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,489
all the stuff so I wanted to give it you

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,370
kind of thing before we start give a

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,260
little background of me and my

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,170
introduction and what this all means how

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,780
Linux and Arctic buoys and how that

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,030
affects and that kind of stuff my

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,879
primary job actually I'm VP of software

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,600
engineering at a start-up in San Jose we

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,699
do earth imaging satellites and I do the

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,470
OBCs them the computer onboard computer

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,229
as well as the software's all systems on

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,140
it my backgrounds pretty much been on

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,600
embedded systems for the last couple of

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,810
decades or more most of it has been on

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,570
the at the firmware level but more on

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,280
the systems integration stuff I do work

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,259
a little bit of hardware but it's more

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,880
on a high level stuff I don't design

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,860
circuits or circuit boards kind of thing

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,920
but I do what closely enough so that I

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,630
can affect the software on it but the

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,259
last 15 years or so I've been

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,750
volunteering both at Stanford University

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,659
as well as with some climate change

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,570
groups and this talk is actually some of

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,340
the work that I did with them and so

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,350
I've been to the you know the Arctic and

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,380
the Antarctic and develop some sensor

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,240
based systems and this is one of them

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,130
and my backgrounds been on special

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,259
instrumentation I've also done work on

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,450
smart meters you know that are outside

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,950
on the cold and the heat you know the

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,649
instruments that fail and the software

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,850
that affects it and so on

00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:04,409
I've worked on some commercial and

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,969
industrial products as well both the

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,940
hardware side and the software side so I

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,140
kind of the system engineer

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,350
product manager kind of things on those

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:16,470
areas by the way feel free to swap our

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,540
ask any questions if you want and keep

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,770
it as informal as possible I wanted to

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,920
give a little bit of the background on

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,320
this why we're with Linux embedded Linux

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,540
is going with this stuff so that the

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,840
goal of this project is to build a

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,340
sensor platform that measures various

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,290
you know parameters it's like incoming

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,140
sunlight and outgoing sunlight and you

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,540
know sonar and ice thickness and so on

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,540
and the location for the initial

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,680
deployment is actually Barrow Alaska

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,460
Barrow

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,440
location-wise it's about 1,300 miles or

00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,380
about 2,000 kilometers from the North

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,650
Pole it's 70 degrees north

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,100
it's the northernmost us town and it's

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,990
got nice facilities and all that stuff

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,560
it's still a little lower but it has a

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:08,160
little bit of brutal weather on it it's

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,600
a you can only fly there you can't drive

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,240
there are no roads to this town you can

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,120
only fly but there are daily flights

00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,280
Alaskan airlines actually services them

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,660
and it's cold and dry and there are no

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,350
wind barriers the Arctic Ocean is

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,760
actually on all three sides during the

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,400
summer I mean during the winter months

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,340
it's 65 days of darkness so you know

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,650
whatever we build has to manage and

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,040
survive that and it's on the Arctic

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,710
coast lots of wildlife so polar bears

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,600
arctic foxes and actually all the stuff

00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,400
affects our software too so I'll talk

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,090
about this day and this good

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,920
infrastructure there so the local

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,570
community their acts provides a lot of

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,040
research work so there's a lot of

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,870
research work that happens all over the

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,900
world and scientists from all over the

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,780
world come there sign in deist you know

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,550
us there's a lot of infrastructure good

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,230
communication infrastructure as well

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:06,330
when I say good good for that kind of

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:09,290
location okay sorry sorry but is it

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,290
better okay

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,530
so this is a quick video this is in July

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,700
we're landing at barrel and I took this

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,920
out on the window just to give you an

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,359
eye idea as to what kind of terrain this

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,100
is that still the Arctic Ocean it's

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,930
still you know frozen and all that stuff

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,300
but you can see it's starting to melt

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,520
and this is when I took this video of it

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,580
before we landed before we had to do

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,770
some servicing on the equipment and this

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,970
is I wanted to show actually filmed this

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,380
for my daughter but it's a nice

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,870
interesting video I wanted to show what

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,760
happens at minus 40 when you throw

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,169
boiling water inside you would have seen

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,360
this there's a lot of videos on YouTube

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,650
about it but I wanted to try this by the

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,740
way I'm died at that

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:54,720
research facility outside it's minus 40

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:56,340
inside it's nice and toasty and the

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:06,450
dangerous part was actually carrying the

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:12,960
hot water out it instantly turns into

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:15,750
snow so the challenge with this stuff is

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,150
I mean it goes on for a while when I

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,410
show this video to a my bear guard by

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,000
the way when we go out into the ice and

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,919
actually I have to set up this equipment

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,690
we need to hire a bear guard the polar

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,810
bears that can attack us so he comes

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,260
with a gun and all so when I showed it

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,630
to him he said please don't waste water

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,700
[Laughter]

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,520
anyway so the big challenges are you

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,810
know so you know just to give a little

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,760
bit of the background so we've been

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,880
testing some of these sensors and sensor

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,760
instruments in Tahoe in parts of Canada

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,770
in Minnesota wherever we could do I mean

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,720
some of the weather is similar but not

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,169
the same especially with the salt water

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,810
and ocean conditions so some of the

00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:00,030
challenges are in size whatever we build

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,400
has to be nice and small the smaller it

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,370
is the easier it is for us to back ship

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,590
and get customs clearance it has to be

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,330
lightweight you know accessing this

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,700
location even though we fly to Barrow

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,070
but once we land there we want to make

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,630
sure it's easily transportable sometimes

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,390
we have to carry it sometimes we have to

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,610
sled it so we ought to make sure it's a

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,249
it's a handle you know it's nice and

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,169
lightweight

00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:26,329
that includes not just the electronics

00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,539
part and the sensors it's also the the

00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:31,729
structure the buoy and things like that

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:34,159
power most of the time power is the

00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:36,259
biggest challenge for us so some of the

00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:37,879
colonel compilations and power

00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:40,429
management stuff that we had to do was

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,049
actually based on power so the the big

00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:43,639
power hogs I'll talk about them a little

00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:46,639
later and the performance so you have to

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,649
compromise the swap thingy right so you

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,349
have size weight power performance and

00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:53,479
of course the cost and performance wise

00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:55,579
yes you can throw in a big computer with

00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,559
a lot of GPU and computing power and all

00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:58,939
that stuff but it doesn't serve much

00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:01,369
purpose and that kind of sensor

00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,839
management stuff of course then the next

00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:04,639
question is why can't you use something

00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,769
like an Arduino or a microcontroller to

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,599
do that and that's where the performance

00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:10,639
part comes in several of these sensors

00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,329
that we use are actually low-cost

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,669
sensors like so and then these sensors

00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:18,349
also have USB drivers or you know

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,269
software that actually works with them

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:23,149
so instead of us trying to get the

00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:25,579
hardware build our own custom PCB solder

00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,379
do form we're level testing it's easier

00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:29,139
if we use a Linux system and this plug

00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:32,629
it in so we need something that is

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:35,360
usable but not but we still have control

00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:37,369
over you know how we configure it how we

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,429
compile it and I will talk a little bit

00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:43,069
about those experiences as well and the

00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:45,619
cost cost is important because you know

00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:47,599
yes we can spend some of the other you

00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:49,639
know the scientific government-sponsored

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,769
buoys cost anywhere between thirty to

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,629
fifty thousand dollars so of course you

00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:55,759
know this group is a non-profit it's a

00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:58,189
privately funded group and they the cost

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,229
was a significant aspect of it so yes

00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,269
the sensors are good when you pay a lot

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,009
of money but you also lose them and I'll

00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:05,509
show some pictures about them and you

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,549
have to always plan as if you're never

00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:08,899
going to retrieve these buoys including

00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:11,119
your data so you want to make sure the

00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:13,489
cost is low so if you lose it off you

00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:16,669
damage it you know you're not you know

00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:18,110
it's not a big big loss secondly keeping

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:19,579
the cost down allows us to build

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,029
multiple buoys and we're not putting

00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:24,739
everything into one system communication

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,259
and this is the challenge also you know

00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:29,539
it's it's so remote and in fact

00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,249
geostationary satellites have to be

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:32,750
pointed down like this instead of up

00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:35,179
because you know the equator is

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,240
somewhere on there so all these antennas

00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,919
are always pointing

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,169
which means a bandwidth is always

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,969
restricted you don't have a lot of usage

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,210
in many parts of the world you can use

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:48,420
unlimited 2g 3G data kind of thing it's

00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:51,089
all you know metered so you have to pay

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,100
for it so communication is a challenge

00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,020
and you can use satellite systems like

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,450
iridium which is fantastic because

00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,029
worldwide Lobley works but it also costs

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:03,300
anomaly like it costs about dollar fifty

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:05,880
per minute of dial-up and that's not so

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,520
much the cost it's a problem it drains

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,930
the batteries like crazy so you want to

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,670
make sure that that's something and

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,950
there's local door data storage that you

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,600
have to manage in case you can't

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,940
communicate you can transmit the data

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,800
you want to have it locally so even if

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,050
your Bui is found several miles away you

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,959
can actually pick it up and retrieve the

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,570
data transport the size this is actually

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,070
part of those first two items size and

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,850
weight so you want to make sure it's

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,649
easily transportable give you an example

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,770
when we shipped everything we had to do

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,420
it came in big containers or suitcases

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,130
sometimes and would land at the airport

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,870
then we would drive it through this

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,120
research site and from that research

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,270
site we have to use snowmobiles or you

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,330
know ATVs to go to that side so so they

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,880
make sure that it you know handles all

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,170
the vibration the bouncy stuff and so

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,860
you don't want to have something that is

00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,150
too small that is hard to handle in

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,000
assembly some assembly on the ice

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,790
happens and operation its autonomous

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,380
semi autonomous and manual you want to

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,480
keep it at wanna miss as possible but

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,459
sometimes things do go crazy and you

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,560
have to reboot or unplug some sensors

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,950
and put them back and do some field

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,270
level testing and it's usually not

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,000
engineers who built them it's usually

00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,529
the support staff or someone who's not

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,029
familiar with its equipment at all they

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,500
have to do this and sometimes you have

00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,870
to do it manually meaning we would tell

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,410
them plug in this cable to run this on

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,880
the phone kind of thing to help them out

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,350
the other part is just as assembly is

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,290
important this assembly is also

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,450
important so most of this research and

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,760
study actually happens when the ice

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,459
melts the goal is to find out how the my

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,140
eyes melts during that melt season but

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,990
we still want to collect how the eye at

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,410
the house beehives during the free cycle

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,670
so

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,129
we put it usually around this time

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,350
November timeframe and then studied

00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:57,379
throughout the winter and then when the

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,569
actual melt happens it happens so fast

00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,459
meaning it happens in six days eight

00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:04,769
days kind of thing and pretty much all

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:06,060
the ice is now liquid water so you want

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:07,500
to make sure you can disassemble it

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,389
properly all you're gonna lose your

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,100
equipment or you may poeple over or I

00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:14,009
may drift off or you will have other

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,480
challenges we've had that one time yeah

00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,040
you know the buoy was not anchored

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,230
properly so it flipped into the water

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,730
and the nice thing the box was

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,709
waterproof so I was taking pictures of

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:27,959
all the fish inside so removal from the

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:30,269
site you know like it's sometimes easier

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,889
to take it to the site and it's harder

00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:34,350
to bring it back because it's got other

00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:35,939
stuff on it and so that's another

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,980
challenge and transport back to the lab

00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:39,480
or disposable sometimes parts of the

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,509
buoy have to be disposed because they

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,129
are broken or can't be used anymore

00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,800
whether an environment and other

00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:48,360
challenges animals as such okay so I'm

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,120
still haven't come to the Linux part of

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,240
it I oh so here is the deployment

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,069
there's the buoy you know we have the

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,750
solar used sonar which actually is

00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:00,420
measuring you know the depth here

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,100
there's a albedo sensor that's measuring

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,139
how much radiation is being bounced off

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,370
the ice so you have four different

00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,350
quadrants so they're measuring for

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,630
different areas that's the battery back

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,310
there's a camera system here this is

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,720
kind of where we'll be talking more and

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,939
you can see the other one the sensors

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,550
pointing up so it knows how much so you

00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:18,839
in the essence of it is how much

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,250
sunlight is coming in and how much

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,810
sunlight is going off how much is

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,269
actually getting converted into eyes and

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,009
so on so forth so I'm not so much on the

00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:28,470
science part more on the instrumentation

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:29,910
and the word part so the computer this

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,430
is the challenges I mean we needed a

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,430
computer that does this it has to be

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,529
finalists of course if you have fan

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,540
you're wasting power and first of all

00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,250
wasting power because you're heating up

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,569
parts that you don't have to heat up and

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,939
then you're running the fan itself so

00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:46,920
anything with a fan is a bad idea so the

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:49,170
slower the clock speed is the more power

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,000
efficient it is and this is one of the

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,220
good ones and our days you get arms for

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,459
arm processors one gigahertz you know

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,500
low-power ones but the other part is

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:00,809
interesting for me at least

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,430
so it's configurable to operate at a

00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,940
lower speed so you can slow down the

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,950
clock

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,190
actually use less power but of course it

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,840
does less it's much slower and there's

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,370
another good thing about this computer

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,830
board I'll show a picture about that is

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,340
it's a bit of roll on and off you can do

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,810
through the software which means you can

00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,720
turn on and turn off a particular bit

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,790
and the USB goes off right so you can

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,550
manage power like that it can run at

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,230
half a watt and it's fully running and

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,810
when it's sleeping it uses very little

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,390
power you can operate at very different

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:37,020
operating voltages so you can run it at

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,660
8 volts 9 all 14 holes 24 volts and

00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,430
it'll still run and this is good because

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,690
the battery doesn't maintain charge all

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,820
the time and depending on the time of

00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:51,840
day and other aspects it goes the

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,400
voltage is very it's got built-in sleep

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,130
timer which means I can shut it off

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,500
meaning I can programmatically say after

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,450
you've done doing this this and this go

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,120
to sleep for 4 hours and then get up

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,680
right so we're not burning power even

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,910
half a watt of power is quite a bit of

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,670
power and and that causes clock drifts

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:15,240
at minus 40 I'll talk about that and so

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,800
the what what I did is we did I mean I

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,960
worked with another engineer as well on

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,480
this we use Debian kernel mainly because

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,900
we used Logitech if we have webcams and

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,340
these are you'd see them a lot of you

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,710
know in a lot of places this is a

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,650
particular model number that works at

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,750
minus 40 and plus 85 it's about $75 it's

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,580
actually a little bit more expensive

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,950
than our computer itself but it works

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,330
great meaning you know and it's easy

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,860
enough you can just go order it off

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,790
Amazon or something

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,740
and and the drivers work on your desktop

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,110
but not for these embedded ones and

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,760
that's where we that's one of the work I

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,790
did a meaning I had to connect them and

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,610
actually compile the right UVC driver to

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,320
make sure that you can turn it on and

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,920
off you can do all the video controls

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,960
you can take still imagery but I still

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,290
wanted to do video I'll explain that in

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,300
a bit

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,810
the video is actually maybe I'll explain

00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,540
it now but video is important because it

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,820
helps the camera focus so the cameras

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,190
inside a box a plastic box actually a

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,140
fishing bait box

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,820
and it survives very well that's the

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,680
reason we tried different boxes you know

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,730
several hundred dollars what the boxes

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,300
and finally that one worked out very

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:29,010
well and it doesn't let ice and rhyme

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,010
stick to it so when you have these

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,290
cameras and you say turn it on take away

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,440
you can use let's say a first webcam or

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:40,260
you know your standard Linux tools and

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,029
grab an image it'll grab most likely the

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,709
image right in front of it which will be

00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:47,880
the reflection of the box itself rather

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:49,740
than the image outside it so so having

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,660
the video controls was important because

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,910
about what we've eventually found out

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,370
that running this video for let's say

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,500
three to five seconds lets the camera

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,450
focus on something outside and

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,760
eventually it gets a good enough image

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,260
of it once that is done we discard all

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,380
the image that was captured and then

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,060
grab one image out of that stream so

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,820
compiling that at the kernel level was

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,529
actually important and again the

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,360
question is yeah there are cameras that

00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,770
will work at minus 40 security cameras

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,380
outside buildings and all why can't you

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,760
use that challenges power weight cost

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,779
performance and so on

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,670
and if any of these things mean the

00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,920
camera doesn't work we can always

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,470
replace it very easily

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,060
we actually had local Wi-Fi we learnt it

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,670
as a bad way that we needed were local

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,800
Wi-Fi reason is a lot of times the we

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,230
put an animal SD card to store data in

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,850
and sometimes the modems will fail or

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,490
they won't communicate and we want to

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,110
take the SD card out and like I said you

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,390
have to do it before the melt happens

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,089
which is slushy dangerous water when

00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,400
you're walking around it and at minus 30

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,640
minus 40 well it's not that cold when it

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,620
melt happens you are wearing gloves and

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,560
you want to make sure that you pull the

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,350
small SD card out of it balancing on a

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,510
board so you know having Wi-Fi helps us

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,490
saying I can configure this as an access

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,929
point when the computer boots up it

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,579
actually comes up and says here's my

00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,959
access point so if I'm close by I can

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,309
use my cell phone or an iPad or

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,370
something like that and download the

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:19,620
data much faster so compiling that was a

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:22,199
challenge again because we found out

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,290
that certain drivers require certain

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,179
other network drivers you know some bit

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,250
to be said before you can compile them

00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,210
so every time you add another piece of

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,740
software that

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,539
needs to run you're adding up more

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,840
complexity the boot time increases which

00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,860
means it's burning more electrical power

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,559
so another one was removing

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,750
non-essential packages making sure only

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,909
the right ones come up and reduce the

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,270
boot time and shutdown shutdown time as

00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:47,039
well

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,380
boot up as quickly as possible do your

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,470
stuff shut down otherwise you're wasting

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,539
power and testing testing a lot of

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,090
testing we did that what freezers and

00:17:54,539 --> 00:18:00,240
actually tested this and interesting

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,130
part is usually do this work in

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,100
mid-summer and we are running freezers

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:08,039
and we're wearing jackets and in 30

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,440
degree heat so the basic operation is

00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:13,140
startup check the disks for any issues

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,510
there's on body MC as well as an SD card

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,220
stored for local data make sure there is

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,559
any issues if there are issues on the

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,059
disk just just move on don't try to fix

00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,740
it because if you try to fix it you're

00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,630
spending power on it

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,809
start the weather data logger it's

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,730
actually using a software-defined radio

00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:32,399
modem card that that we had to compile

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,960
as well so many of these accurate and

00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:35,789
weather stations that you can get off

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,010
the market they actually work fantastic

00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,470
even in that cold but they transmit at

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,000
433 megahertz you know the unlicensed

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,640
band and so you can pick it up in your

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,950
home so what we did is actually a built

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,470
I mean we got a software-defined radio

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,390
USB dongle plugged it into it compiled

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,210
the driver ran it and so we can read off

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,309
the weather station remotely so that's

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,690
another work we did there's a one wire

00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,070
temperature logger the one that you

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,840
didn't see on the picture was there's

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,179
actually a long thick cable about four

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,490
meters long that goes deep into the eyes

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,470
with sensors at every level so you get a

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,110
profile of what the water and ice

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,429
thickness is interesting fact is the

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,140
place where we were testing the melt

00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:16,440
actually happens from bottom up and not

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,970
top down that's because all the melt

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,130
water that flows into the area actually

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:24,090
starts to heat up and melt the ice from

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:25,980
bottom up not from top down so much so

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,059
log system parameters so I'd this is

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,950
important for me I want to make sure

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,899
what battery it is how much disk space

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,970
what the CPU temperature is what the IP

00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:36,630
address is if I'm getting an IP address

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:40,409
and try to send this sensor and data log

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:42,330
through local 3G network I say 3G

00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:43,270
because it's not good and at that

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,650
location we

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,170
actually had to had cell repeaters to

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,150
get that working if none of that is

00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,680
possible we capture images we capture

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,690
all this data I'm trying to transmit it

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,210
none of that this is happening just one

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,280
try no three tries note four ties move

00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,500
it to an archive meaning move it to a

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,840
directory and then initiate a shutdown

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,810
because the more we try the more power

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,580
we waste so we try that and do that and

00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,130
initiate a shutdown and then do a disk

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,840
flush and sleep for X second six seconds

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,670
usually the researcher says I want data

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,470
every four hours or two hours or every

00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:20,460
day then they define those seconds

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:23,200
that's the computer its body size and

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,780
there's a small battery that keeps the

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,700
clock alive nothing else on it very

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,680
similar to the raspberry PI's and you

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,540
know the beaglebones they actually work

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,850
very well too but this one actually has

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,470
a real-time clock and all the software

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,050
base peripheries and everything built

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,670
into it it's not terribly expensive - so

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,480
compared to the time you spend on this

00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,560
system it's made by a company called

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,310
technologic systems it's about one

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,080
hundred and fifty dollars or so and but

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,790
you do get different models it's it can

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,550
support external hardware and all and

00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,230
this is after a long time the hardware

00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,450
is saying you might be surprised these

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,180
actually work very well at minus 40 and

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,430
this is actually a Belkin thing of all

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,700
the USB hubs we've seen Belkin works

00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:08,680
great it actually has an external power

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,450
supply so which means I can using this

00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,430
computer trigger it on meaning after the

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,500
boot sequence is done then I trigger it

00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,240
on which means when this one's powered

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,970
on best or the devices start to show up

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,130
on the /dev directory and then I can

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:25,360
start managing them

00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:27,280
this is hawawa modem expensive for the

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,410
rest of the stuff it's about $50 or so

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,780
but it actually works up to minus 40

00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,270
minus 20 anything lower than that it's

00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,600
connects but it drops packets or doesn't

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,460
do handshakes of course this is such a

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,560
low volume that you know the

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,300
manufacturers wouldn't spend time on

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,390
trying to discuss why that happens but

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:50,110
anyway this is kind of the lab kind of a

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:53,170
scenario again you know challenges right

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,390
so that sensor that I showed you we had

00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:58,170
a pipe

00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,820
a fox chewed this up right and why this

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,320
is important this when we're trying to

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,360
read the sensor and we are getting some

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,070
weird values we want to make sure that

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,470
we're not trying to reread again and

00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,060
waste power so I want to move on so

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,290
knowing this was actually helpful if

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,480
there was an arctic fox and apparently

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,340
they chew a lot of cables so the next

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,510
thing we had actually put a cap on it

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,100
and make sure that they don't get to the

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:21,690
wires for some reason they actually come

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,190
in and chew this is you can see there

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,290
are three arms the fourth ones actually

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:29,060
standing here we believe a polar bear

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:31,680
stepped on it and broke the sensors and

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,800
so when we started to get it getting

00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,380
data missing data coming up or when your

00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,820
numbers start to show as minus two minus

00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,350
three and all of a sudden your

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,880
temperature data is three thousand

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,560
thirty two thousand six hundred and

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,990
something something you know something

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,810
weird is happening so so you know we

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,030
have to make sure that we catch all that

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:55,680
data as well you can see there's a small

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:58,200
Wi-Fi antenna here and this is another

00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,540
scenario where we we saw earlier I

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,540
showed you a sonar you know it actually

00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:06,750
tells you how much just ice depth is

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,280
well after one blizzard there was so

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,860
much ice inside which we were getting

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,600
all incorrect readings so even though

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,220
the data was showing up on our server

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,860
side and we were doing parsing and

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,200
storing it into our databases trying to

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,300
plot graphs the graphs went like this

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,580
because you know suddenly you have all

00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,230
this data so finally we had to actually

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,150
send someone to chip out all their eyes

00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:30,360
but after a while we found out that the

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:33,240
problem was so repeatedly happening that

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,310
they decided to change the sensor it's

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,690
meant for industrial automation so it's

00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,220
not meant to so even though it's

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,100
temperature rated it's not meant to

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,630
handle this kind of situation minus

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,900
forty other things happen you know

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,520
cables that are normally flexible become

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,070
like sticks so you can actually tap them

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,140
and break them so those kind of

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,660
challenges happen and anytime you have a

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,310
sensor failure a minus forty it's hard

00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,050
for you to open the box up and try to

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,570
fix these things even trying to get it

00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,730
out of the box there's a challenge we

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,470
tried and we kind of ruin the entire

00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,380
experiment one time because we pull this

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,630
try to pull the cable the cable snap

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,000
the cable was still sticking inside but

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,040
it yanked the boards that the board pins

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,480
broke and all that stuff so and it's

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,520
also not possible for us to dismantle

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,900
the whole thing take it to the lab fix

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,370
it and bring it back because in all the

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,510
sensors are all embedded into the eyes

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:26,160
and it's it's a fairly ruggedized there

00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,500
are physical design changes that are

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,930
happening so the next version was don't

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,670
run the cables inside but put some good

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,470
connectors outside so you can dismantle

00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,110
the connectors and leave the box as it

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,480
is but you still have sensors running

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:41,400
into the eyes so you still have to drill

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,120
another hole and start to do other parts

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,430
of it you know that's another one you

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,040
know all these rhyme it says is not

00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:51,510
really good and inside the temperature

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,400
though inside the box though it's very

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,380
interesting because when I get the

00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,660
system log and see it when it starts up

00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,090
it will show up like minus 20 because by

00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,680
the time the CPU has heated up and it

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,710
will show minus 20 by the time it shut

00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,890
off it's plus 40 degrees C inside the

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:12,680
box but it's minus 40 outside it's not

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:18,240
always minus 48 minus 40 is happens

00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:19,800
fairly regularly and deployment

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,660
constraints I think I told you about

00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,910
this we have to ship by air there's no

00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,780
ground transportation there's a local SD

00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:29,940
card we even started using bluetooth but

00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,900
there are some operational challenges if

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,370
multiple researchers want to see this

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:38,850
Wi-Fi is better vibration I think we

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:41,310
spoke cabling cellular and satellite

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:44,340
modem we use iridium so we start using

00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:46,470
your radium only for text data you don't

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,260
dial up once you start dial up it drains

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,880
your battery like crazy and we've

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,690
started putting in solar panels as well

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,240
and also started to use cellular network

00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,360
we try to set up Wi-Fi repeaters into

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,630
the ocean but managing each of those

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,460
repeaters themselves becomes a project I

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:09,180
think besides poke enough about this

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,130
Phil stop me if I'm rushing too fast you

00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,230
know the buoy structure is one so we use

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,450
ring buoys these commercial-grade buoys

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,340
the batteries are lithium batteries and

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,050
this is another challenge the bigger the

00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,900
battery is the harder it is for you to

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,850
get clearance to take

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,130
get up in an airplane so it has to meet

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:26,380
certain specifications the cameras are

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:29,050
the Logitech ones we started using small

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,510
five watt solar panels question is why

00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:33,610
can't you use bigger ones the because

00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,560
what happens is that that angle the Sun

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,880
doesn't just if that's east and this is

00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,650
where as the Sun doesn't just come up

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,140
like this kind of goes around you

00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,360
because you're in kind of that part so

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,350
it kind of rises up and goes around you

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,930
so which means you have to put the

00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,780
panel's almost 90 degrees so the bigger

00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,790
the panel is the more wind resistance it

00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:55,150
has so you want to have something that

00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:57,430
is small enough that that doesn't matter

00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,900
as a sail but something on all four

00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,580
sides because you're not just pointing

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,500
on one angle you are now catching the

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,860
Sun on all four sides so we started

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,960
putting a smaller 5 or 10 watt solar

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,880
panels we tried we thought we were

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,980
clever enough by putting flexible panels

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,930
but flexible panels tend to flap a lot

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:17,670
and that actually causes more problems

00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:20,260
so tightening things as much easier and

00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,850
so the lithium battery part I spoke

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,980
about there are charge controllers that

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,780
we can use small 12-volt 5 volt charge

00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,240
controllers that control this and the

00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,340
nice thing is several of them are serial

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,210
devices so they actually show up a /dev

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,830
TTY SOS one and so on so you can

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,350
actually read off and say how much

00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,990
battery voltage do I have and you know

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,480
what's the state of my system and so on

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:45,010
drivers they provide but this was mostly

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,570
a hack because that chopper tiller

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,920
charge controller was designed for a

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,870
Windows system and they gave their own

00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,510
drivers so we had to recompile a whole

00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:55,990
bunch of those things a lot of open

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:58,180
source tools and sleep timers I said

00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,730
I'll talk about this stuff at minus 40

00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,890
the clocks tend to go slow and at higher

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,050
temperatures they move faster so when

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,890
you've asked the clock say wake me up in

00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,230
two hours

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,240
it actually wakes up much later because

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,650
now the clock frequency has gone down

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,840
and it actually there's a drift

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,360
happening and over time this accumulates

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,100
so instead of reporting in and saying

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,110
every two hours here's your data it'll

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,330
report in after two hours five minutes

00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:25,000
two hours ten minutes and so on and

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,930
because you don't have and there's

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,700
nothing you could do about it because

00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,200
even the battery thinks that's what the

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,100
time is I mean there's nothing we can do

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,320
unless you can do a connect to an NTP

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,760
silver and time sink it and those are

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,559
expensive operations which means you

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,640
have to keep up a tcp/ip connection long

00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,799
enough to do all this time

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,840
synchronization we do that occasionally

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,280
once you start to see that occasionally

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,470
once every three days or four days

00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,150
especially during the polar winter it

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,299
actually comes up and does a time

00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,400
synchronization that border also has a

00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:56,190
particular quirkiness because once the

00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,799
time sort of thing fails it resets its

00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,020
date back to 1970 so sometimes you know

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,120
you start to see things like okay it's

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,059
all 2017 all of a sudden and now you're

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,309
getting big data from to 1970 and

00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:12,230
clock goes crazy so we have to work

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:14,850
around those challenges as well the most

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,340
power intensive system is the trance are

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,140
the transmitters and you know like the

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,650
Wi-Fi the satellite modem the Bluetooth

00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:25,980
so keeping them as minimally used as

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:28,200
possible or is this the best operational

00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,870
method for us the second biggest power

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:36,480
hog is actually the other cameras so the

00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:38,730
less cameras the better it is sorry but

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,320
I think I could rush through most of the

00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,860
things I'll be more than happy to answer

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,860
any questions

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:56,159
we don't actually and the problem is

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,200
there is advantageous to I mean we

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,750
deployed it in November and pick it up

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,450
in July so we can always do software

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,400
update in the past we have done updates

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,950
but it's not been software update it's

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,470
been configuration updates so usually

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,330
you have a like a CSV file or an XML

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,970
file and say instead of doing 20 if

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,980
sleep every two hours I would say sleep

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,960
every six hours and it's a configuration

00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,789
change right similarly if I want to

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,600
start monitoring some parameters I can

00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:26,580
do that too occasionally and one of the

00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,130
reasons I put an IP address as one of my

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,830
standard parameters is occasionally when

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:34,080
the from the research site onto the buoy

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,610
site we do have Wi-Fi connectivity it

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,909
lasted for a while meaning then the

00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:40,440
blizzard came up and took out the Wi-Fi

00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:42,030
transmitter but when we had that

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,679
connection we could actually SSH from

00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,600
California into the box and actually do

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,240
what changes and monitor things that was

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,590
very used

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,670
because we could even play around with a

00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:54,580
set timers run diagnostic on it do the

00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:57,190
NTP server time updates and so on very

00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,840
risky to do not advisable at ha because

00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,850
if something goes wrong you have to ask

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,100
your bear guard who's more interested in

00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,750
handling your gun to go to the site to

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,980
say ok I'm going to reboot something

00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:11,290
rather than actually doing that so yeah

00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,940
you know short answer is no we don't do

00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,770
updates on the field

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:21,250
well we bring it back we release the

00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:23,410
next version and so on so the question

00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:27,070
is how do you set it how do you test it

00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:30,520
and we have a big ice cream freezer

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,990
it goes up to minus 29 not minus 40 but

00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,630
we believe that anything that we cannot

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,970
find out at - 29 we won't find out at

00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:40,000
minus 40 so usually things like you know

00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:42,640
we find leaks inside that allows cold

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,770
air and then when the system warms up

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,800
because the CPU is running that

00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:50,080
condensation shots circuitry and all and

00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,940
so so we got to do a lot of these

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,640
testing some of these equipment don't

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,660
work the way they're spec sheet says so

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,650
in fact not some almost all of them

00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,450
sometimes to the betterment I mean we've

00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,570
tested modems that are rated for minus

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:07,540
40 but they work at minus 55 not that we

00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,210
needed to test them at minus 55 minus 40

00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,100
by the way is the industrial temperature

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,400
range for most products and that's what

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,400
we went with in in one of my other

00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,260
projects we tried to if you go to try to

00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,820
do anything lower than minus 40 there

00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,210
are a lot of export control restrictions

00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,610
on them because they become dual use

00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,710
technology so minus 40 so freezer is one

00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,150
of the tests and we don't do anything

00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,040
like nickel nitrogen and things like

00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,890
that is just too much work for a

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,230
software engineer to handle but you know

00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,929
but it is testing interesting and most

00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:43,570
of the development once it's done I

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,460
would say 80 to 85 percent of the time

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,050
is actually testing testing making sure

00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,170
why something works something does not

00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:52,570
work and like the camera focus issue was

00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,220
another problem we've the reason I said

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,470
that the first season everything went

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,660
fine the second season when we tried it

00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,710
there were small icicles sickening on

00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,740
the box and the camera

00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:05,740
is focusing on that instead of this

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:09,190
imagery outside so having to have the

00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,809
video option compiled and capable on the

00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,460
camera was actually important for us so

00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:14,679
a lot of testing has to be done when I

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,299
say testing not just physical testing

00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:19,600
but actually running the full software

00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:23,279
suite test start cycle stop cycle do it

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,279
many times to actually get the data out

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,590
both actually on-site is because every

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,390
site is unique some of the sites some of

00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,340
the tests we've done in Chicago and

00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,950
Minnesota actually face more brutal

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:49,000
conditions than their the temperatures

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:51,159
are much horrible but there is also a

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,590
big engineering community that actually

00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:55,179
works on this kind of work on the

00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,880
technology part of it not the science

00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:59,740
part of it if you could look up polar

00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,149
technology conference dot org that's

00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,289
like a conference that happens every

00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:03,850
year where all the engineers get

00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:06,070
together and say which this works and

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,510
what doesn't work and what's the cost of

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,450
it and they share their knowledge kind

00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:12,099
of thing so they do share a lot in fact

00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,659
the camera aspect was something that I

00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:16,960
found out from them they were the ones

00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:19,330
who said oh don't use c910 you c920 that

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,040
works at minus 40 and of course you know

00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,109
we test ten cameras and find out that

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,730
nine of them work one doesn't work your

00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:26,500
work in your desktop environment it just

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,470
doesn't work meaning the images would

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,490
all be pink at minus any day any time it

00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,490
goes to lower temperatures

00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:46,540
actually that's a yeah yes that's a very

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,780
good question and that a de prata

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:52,089
and I'll tell you why I was happy that

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:54,280
you asked that is because if you just

00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:56,169
keep the memory alive and keep the

00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,609
process of a lie then your boot up time

00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:58,930
can be fast right

00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,660
which means you save a lot of time

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,859
that's good like in an automobile kind

00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,740
of an environment where you have to shut

00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:08,730
down and start fast but keeping that

00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,839
memory alive also consumes power and

00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,400
even though we what I will like that

00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:14,530
feature that computer board does not

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,150
support it in fact that power of

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,890
sequence is actually by another

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,290
microcontroller that you can talk

00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:23,680
through the Linux driver and say when

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:26,530
you say sleep forty seconds it will just

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,260
cut power immediately right so which

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,270
means this corruption disk flush you

00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,460
better be done with all that stuff so in

00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,220
fact what I did was we actually put all

00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,730
the sequence of this set up process kill

00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:44,200
everything and the last one in the slash

00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:46,480
in it the /k 11 reboot file was just a

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,130
cut to cut the power of her day and that

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,990
worked very well rather than trying to

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,580
do our own shutdown sequence because the

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:55,050
shutdown sequence is handled by Linux

00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,050
and the last statement is cut power to

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,240
well nothing

00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:07,869
I would love to mainly time is the

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,790
constraint there is I do share my

00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:11,470
findings in fact with the board guys I

00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,420
mean the board guys were interested to

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,970
find out how I did certain pieces of

00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,500
work and I published that data at the

00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,080
polar Technology Conference is another

00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,810
one that I talked about and publish work

00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,430
as well not a lot of Linux guys there

00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,050
but there are a few of them who do some

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,359
hardcore work as well they've done some

00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,730
even more serious Antarctic buoys and

00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:32,890
robots that operate outside volcanoes

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,830
inside Antartica that kind of thing so

00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,530
there they do some real good work and so

00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,460
the sum of their work they use on their

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:43,000
real jobs too

00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,710
so so yeah there is contact me if you're

00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,770
interested I'll be more than happy to

00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:49,180
just do part lists or even software most

00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,009
of it is hack

00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,470
just get it working quickly enough so

00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:55,900
that we can roll it out sometimes it's a

00:36:53,470 --> 00:37:09,369
well-thought-out processing yes we got

00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:10,900
to do this oh that's okay let me give in

00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:12,700
working with this particular group since

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,549
2009 the first time we did it we had

00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,099
four massive buoys each one can handle

00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:20,769
sixty kilos and the whole thing had to

00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:22,749
be assembled on ice with metal brackets

00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:24,970
and all and so we had like a big

00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:26,920
electrical box that was waterproof and a

00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,890
big computer and did a whole bunch of

00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,869
these things so the reason I tell you

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,880
the back story is we found out that when

00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:36,249
the ice melts and that happens you

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,630
cannot even on a big strong board how

00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:38,859
powerful you are trying to pull

00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,499
something like that into your board

00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:43,029
because there's a $4,000 cable stuck to

00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:45,670
a piece of ice that's pulling you and

00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:47,979
your boat down right so you want to make

00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,749
sure that you retrieve the data the very

00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:51,579
least you want to retrieve the equipment

00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:53,079
as such so we went through multiple

00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:56,200
iterations and we went through multiple

00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:59,410
boards like this the board that I used

00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,329
was a 72 40 or some version number that

00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:04,299
worked well there are other boards which

00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:06,339
did an equally good performance so every

00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:08,289
time we change board we had redo

00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:11,499
recompile make sure the ports were

00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:13,630
designed properly and all so you know to

00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:17,219
get something like this working tested

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:20,769
properly took me about three full time

00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:23,140
months you know eight hours a day three

00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:27,039
months kinda thing right so of course

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,509
this was my volunteer time so I had to

00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,789
do it nights and weekends with a lot of

00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:32,559
help and also on the on the average of

00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:34,539
that's kind of the time but once you get

00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,609
it afterwards modifying it becomes easy

00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:40,089
then you know which library has what and

00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:43,440
you don't have to find grab kind of a

00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:43,440
thing to find a particular library

00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:52,870
so so one of the electrical engineers

00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,880
actually built a small probe which you

00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,910
can plug into the board and find out

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,010
what your power level is and it has an A

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,350
to D converter on board so we just read

00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,180
the gate to D converter periodically and

00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,250
found out when we start the battery this

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,530
is what happens and we plot graphs and

00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,150
actually visually take a look at it we

00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,750
actually that was good when when we were

00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:16,180
doing the freezer tests we could on my

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:18,070
desktop 25 degrees centigrade

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,350
everything will be fine you know works

00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,640
fine you can heat it up cold once you

00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,380
start putting it in the freezer you can

00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,970
start to see the battery go down and

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,680
then it starts to pick up and so on so

00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,660
we actually had to build a special probe

00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,700
for it the newer charge controllers

00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,740
handle it much better because they meant

00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,450
to do industrial stuff but some of them

00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,430
are heavier and some of them are also

00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,470
more expensive now one of the charge

00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,420
controller was a $300 piece of equipment

00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:52,960
so more expensive than the computer

00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:55,480
itself okay so the question is there

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,290
okay I know we're running out of time

00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:01,540
but I'll try to answer that I won't give

00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,400
you a short answer so when we initially

00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,190
started one of the reasons why we use

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,620
that big 60 kilogram buoys was we had a

00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,000
lot of lead acid batteries the reason

00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,160
for these lead acid batteries are

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,230
they're cheap and you get the sealed

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,580
ones with the ones you use in wheelchair

00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:18,130
which means you can transport them on a

00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,390
plane right and there so of course there

00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,920
are some restrictions you can handle

00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,470
them you will fill out the paperwork you

00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,090
can do that and so if your battery dies

00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,550
in the middle of the Arctic it's easier

00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,260
for you to get a you know snowmobile

00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,510
battery is a replacement and plug it in

00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,550
right so we started with that but then

00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,900
we realized that these batteries even

00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,760
though they're cheap they're very heavy

00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,100
heavy means you have a lot of other

00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,900
logistical problems so we needed a

00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,180
battery that actually works at minus 40

00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,580
properly and that radios the

00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,800
transmitters they actually pull quite a

00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,420
bit of power when they do this burst

00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,280
when I say quite a bit of power not

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,440
talking about megawatts I mean at five

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,690
volts it would jump periodically to two

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,130
amps for like maybe a second or so right

00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,990
and then would drop back so you

00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,700
other batteries alkaline batteries and I

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,490
wouldn't do that but they wouldn't cut

00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,779
off power either so what happens is you

00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:08,240
would see that the motor wouldn't try to

00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:09,710
transmit and transmission failed is what

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,599
you'd get then you would be looking so

00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,910
much into your heart your cord and your

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,319
software and you'll blame your modem for

00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,759
not doing it and then you realize it's

00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:19,609
actually the battery that's not good

00:41:16,759 --> 00:41:21,980
enough and after a while actually in one

00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:23,839
of these conferences the lithium

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,730
batteries are very good and doing this

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,470
they can provide a whole bunch of power

00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,440
but the problem with these lithium

00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,509
batteries is you cannot charge them at a

00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,250
low temperature or you when you charge

00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:36,170
them you need a very specific charge

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,789
controller a lot of the lithium fires

00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,230
that you see are because you try to

00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:41,359
charge them at the wrong thing and then

00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,890
it leads to tunnels run away so for a

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,630
lot of times we use just generally

00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,130
double a lithium batteries that work

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,809
great because you can buy these lithium

00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,940
batteries and put it on but at this

00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:51,440
location you can't buy them and since we

00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,210
are flying them they wouldn't fly them

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,490
they wouldn't ship them over so we

00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:57,470
started to resort to using battery banks

00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:00,109
that we use that for charging our cell

00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,240
phones because now you could ask one of

00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:04,099
the bear guards say unplug this battery

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,660
go back to your research station plug it

00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:07,910
into the wall plug charge it back and

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,519
come back again and just plug connectors

00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,319
USB connector and it works right but

00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:13,970
there are different challenges with

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,069
there with these battery technologies

00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,750
and how you connect them to the your

00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:20,480
computer because you want to have

00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:23,059
something that's reliable compact in

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,759
fact we can shrink this lot lot smaller

00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:28,130
I mean the box is about da size but you

00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:30,589
can shrink this to like a cell phone

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,750
size but the biggest challenge there is

00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,980
your your battery pack the battery packs

00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,289
are big and they're the ones would

00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,569
consume a lot of power so right now we

00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:40,430
haven't integrated any power management

00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:43,279
system into these battery packs because

00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:47,380
these are detached low-cost

00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:47,380
systems that you just plug in and use

00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:56,140
any other questions thank you thank you

00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,140
