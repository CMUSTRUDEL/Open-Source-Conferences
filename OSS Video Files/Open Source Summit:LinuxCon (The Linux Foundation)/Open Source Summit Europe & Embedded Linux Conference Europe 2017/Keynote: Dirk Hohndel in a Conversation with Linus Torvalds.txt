	Keynote: Dirk Hohndel, VP & Chief Open Source Officer, VMware in a Conversation with Linux and Git Creator Linus Torvalds 

About Dirk Hohndel
Dirk is VMware’s Chief Open Source Officer, leading the company’s open source efforts and strategy and driving common values and processes across the company for VMware’s interaction with the open source communities. Before joining VMware, Dirk spent almost 15 years as Intel’s Chief Linux and Open Source Technologist, guiding Intel’s engagements in open source. Before that, among other roles, he worked as Chief Technology Officer of SuSE and Unix Architect of Deutsche Bank. Dirk has been an active developer and contributor in Linux and open source since the early 1990s. He was one of the early Linux kernel developers and has contributed to several dozen open source projects over the years. Dirk holds a Diploma in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Würzburg, Germany. He lives in Portland, OR.

About Linus Torvalds
Linus was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He enrolled at the University of Helsinki in 1988, graduating with a master's degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis was titled “Linux: A Portable Operating System” and was the genesis for what would become the most important collaborative software project in history.In August 1991, Linus announced that he was developing the Linux kernel, proclaiming, “it won’t be big and professional.” Never in the history of technology has someone been so wrong. In spite of his humble proclamation, Linux has become the world’s most pervasive operating system. Today the Linux kernel forms the basis of the Linux operating system and powers billions of Android devices, powers ChromeOS, and has permeated almost every industry and form factor. Smartphones, TVs, appliances, cars, nuclear submarines, air traffic control, stock exchanges, and scientific research all run Linux. Linux also provides the underpinnings of the internet and the cloud computing industry.In 2005, citing a lack of free and open source version control tools that met his needs for performance and scale, Linus famously created Git in only 10 days. Today Git is widely used in software development and for other version-control tasks such as configuration management, and has become popular as an integral part of the DevOps culture.In 2000, Linus was listed by Time Magazine as Number 17 in the Time 100: Most Important People of the Century. Again, in 2004, Time Magazine named him one of the Most Influential People in the world. He was honored in 2008 with the Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland, “in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel.” He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award. A true tech titan, he was admitted to the Computer History Museum Hall of Fellows, joining the ranks of the tech elite including Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, Tim Berners-Lee, Gordon Moore, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Steve Wozniak, and others.Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,509
hey good morning that's a crowd and I

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,440
think we have the two oldest people on

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,150
the stage yet so it's it's good to be

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,730
back in Prague we were actually here I

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,540
think six years ago and it's wonderful

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,449
to be back

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,689
I wished our trip had been slightly less

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,330
eventful we got our bags this morning

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,890
which wasn't exactly when we arrived but

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,920
hey we got the back so that's that's

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,410
definitely a pro so I'm the kondal I'm

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,850
the chief open-source officer for VMware

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,610
and you are again I am Linus and I hate

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,690
doing public speaking so for the last

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:45,300
probably 15 years by now this has been

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,070
the only format I basically do because

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,590
this way I don't have to prepare slides

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,930
and I don't have to think about what the

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,020
audience wants to hear about that's his

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,329
job yes questions and we try to make

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,989
this interesting and I don't know the

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,949
questions beforehand so so it's not been

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,330
15 years it only feels that loneliness

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:06,780
we started doing this six years ago

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,939
actually

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,770
so for 14 rc6 is out and you said in the

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,710
announcement that you might have to do

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:21,930
an RC 8 so right I always ask myself is

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:25,409
this good or is this bad or I'd say we

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:30,060
have no real rules about how many RCS we

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,619
do it's just that over we so in the

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,189
current community we use the same

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,869
process now for over a decade where for

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,880
two weeks we have the merge window I'm

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,450
assuming most of you are familiar with

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,860
this and then we have a number of weeks

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,229
of weekly RCS and and I'm mostly really

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,040
guided by how it feels

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:57,149
having done this for a long time it's

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,070
not like I have a checklist of this

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,460
needs to be done before I make a release

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,000
it's really a looking at what the

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,810
patterns of patches coming in is it does

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,650
it feel like it's slowing down and and

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,379
we usually end up with 7 RCS and

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,620
and then the final release it takes us

00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:22,950
about two and a half months with the

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,250
merge window and this particular merge

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,370
window was more painful than usual

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,069
probably because Greg who's in the room

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,650
somewhere announced that it's going to

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,450
be a long term support thing and that

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,220
always means that all the companies who

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,680
care about the long term support kernels

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,549
they say hey we need to get our features

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,099
in this release so there's more hurrying

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,109
going on going on that there normally is

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,470
one of the nice things about our normal

00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:54,420
release schedule is we do releases every

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,579
two and a half months so people don't

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,340
feel pressured to hit a particular

00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,590
release if if the code is not ready it's

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,959
not ready it's fine I'll wait until the

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,870
next merge winter except when long-term

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,769
releases happen so we the last one was

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:14,840
4.9 and it was the largest kernel ever

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:18,540
and current one is going to be 414 and

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,199
it's slightly more painful than some of

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,239
the earlier kernels were but so right

00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,599
now it feels like I'll probably extend

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,609
it by one release curl candidate but

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,739
we'll see what happens so you're talking

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,169
about painful and obviously here in

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,799
Prague is the Linux kernel maintainer

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,650
summit

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,139
so which subsystems caused you the most

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:46,500
trouble or if you want to be positive

00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:48,090
which are the role models or both I am

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,609
going to name names but I'm going to

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,979
name names in private tomorrow during

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:57,930
the kernel summit I guess I can speak

00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,510
about one of the shining stars was it

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,090
which is arm which I used to hate and

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,579
now it's like one of the shining stars

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,909
of good behavior and I never have any

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:12,389
issues with them anymore the the

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,310
problems problem spots tend to move

00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:16,919
around a bit although there are a few

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,859
recurring ones that I will we will be

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,380
discussing tomorrow oh so words will be

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,389
spoken that's interesting so one thing

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,090
that I found interesting when when Jim

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,330
introduced our our first speakers was

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,150
his

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,000
focus in in talking about the the

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,430
colonel report on how many first-time

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,770
developers we have and and how this

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,180
community keeps getting younger yet

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,400
looking at the two of us

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,030
I've known you for more than 25 years

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,490
and looking at the the Colonel community

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,310
in general and specifically at the

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:54,300
maintainer community I think we are

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,180
seeing not a lot of influx of new

00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,509
maintainer and part of that I think is

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,349
the insane complexity of of what we do

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:07,440
so what do you think about do we do

00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:10,139
enough to get young younger blood into

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,919
the maintainer community I don't know I

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:17,460
mean that is probably one of our biggest

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:19,469
issues is that it's being a maintainer

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,919
is kind of painful it's not that it

00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:25,580
necessarily is hard once you get used to

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,169
it but you do want need to have a lot of

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:32,099
experience you need to have experience

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:35,250
for two reasons one is just in order to

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,990
handle all the flow you just need to

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,139
have done it for long enough that it's

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,509
not overwhelming it's like learning a

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:46,050
new language it's hard in the beginning

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:50,069
and if you get a thousand emails and you

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:53,009
have to walk through each one and decode

00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:55,319
it and think a lot about it it's a lot

00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:59,370
of work compared to somebody who's been

00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:04,409
doing it for 15 years or 25 years and

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:06,180
and by now I see patches in my sleep I

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:07,860
see a patch and I know what it does and

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,259
I don't I don't spend any time thinking

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,750
about it because it's all automatic so

00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,060
that's one reason maintainer ships tend

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,129
to be with people who SB in Iran for a

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:23,580
long time the other reason is purely

00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:26,520
external you need to not only have grown

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,370
the capacity to handle the inflow of

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,940
patches you need to also have shown to

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,880
the community that you're reliable and

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,620
you're around and you're around every

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,240
day of the year or you are part of a

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,870
group

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,810
that that is responsible and somebody's

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,930
around pretty much every day of the year

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:51,020
so getting new maintained errs has been

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,440
one of our biggest problems we we have

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,860
people who for one reason or another

00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,680
decide that maintainer ship is they've

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,949
been doing it asked their main job for a

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,530
decade and they decide that they are

00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,440
moving on to doing something else having

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,330
your life having a life or maybe they're

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,800
moving on to a different area because

00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,090
they moved companies or something like

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,699
that and and then finding new people to

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,460
to pick up the slack can be a big

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:26,780
problem and it's not something that a

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:29,150
new person can just come in and do but

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,880
the good news is if you do want to be a

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,819
maintainer trust me we want maintainer

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,490
I love maintainer I it may not always

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:40,220
appear that way in my emails don't get

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,919
me wrong but but people is a wrong kind

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,349
of love it is a it is a tough love but

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,169
but people who who do the work and are

00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:50,409
reliable are absolutely I mean the most

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:54,650
important people in the community and

00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:57,139
and we are looking for people and and if

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,570
you can show that you are reliable and

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,430
you are there and you are responsive you

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,180
don't have to be perfect don't get me

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,490
wrong

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,819
everybody makes mistakes everybody sends

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,569
in bad stuff but if if you then stand up

00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:11,659
and said sorry

00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:14,539
my bad and here's the fix that makes

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,699
people trust you and you do need to do

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:20,300
it for a few years to show that you

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:22,400
really are you not only are trustworthy

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,009
but you have the capacity to stick to

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,020
something but if you want to be a

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,050
maintainer it's not that hard in the end

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,819
because we want you so over the last few

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,310
years you have pushed many of the major

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,770
subsystems to have maintainer groups so

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,680
two three four people is that a way to

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,229
mentor new maintenance to add them to an

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,899
established group and have them grow in

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,029
that rotation it probably could be we

00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:51,020
have done in mainly for different

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,860
reasons we have done it because being

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,780
there

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:59,360
every day where every week is tough and

00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:02,410
and one single person will eventually

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,170
burn out and people take vacations and

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:10,250
I'm I'm in a good position where I can

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:12,860
usually time my vacations not always but

00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,470
I try very hard to time my vacations so

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,450
that they're in the end of the RC series

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:23,090
when my workload is much lower because

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,880
at that point I know I don't have to do

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:29,000
20 pull requests a day I have two or

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,980
three or Tuesdays I usually have none

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,610
for some reason it's Fridays and

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,040
Saturdays that I get most pull requests

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,740
but but if you're a subsystem maintainer

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,020
and you get these occasional patches

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,750
from driver developers or somebody else

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,240
you need to be there day in and day out

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,520
and having instead of having one person

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,770
maintain a subsystem having three or

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,960
four people maintain one has turned out

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:59,450
to be a good way to allow people to to

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,250
not have to be there all the time but it

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,760
probably would be a good way to bring

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,440
new people into so maybe a maintainer

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,370
mentoring program is something you

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,650
should discuss at the maintain a summit

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,320
probably I mean you don't come in as a

00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,300
maintainer from nowhere you you come in

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,200
as a maintainer because you used to be a

00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:24,290
developer and mostly the maintainer ship

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,300
hierarchy it it sometimes looks like we

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,330
actually designed this thing and that is

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,240
not the case we don't have a committee

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,610
that says now you are the maintainer it

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,660
is very organic it happens fairly

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:41,390
automatically if you have been a

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:45,320
developer and active for a while it

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:47,330
might be more of a tagger it than a

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,370
committee saying hey we have a new

00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,970
maintainer it's more like you've been

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,730
doing the work now I'll take all my

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:58,550
patches from you so I'll try a fun

00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:03,830
question who in the audience was born

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:05,180
1991 or later so all these people Linux

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,190
has been around for all

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:10,760
their lives if you have to imagine that

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,260
when when we started with Linux in in 91

00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,890
to us

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,620
UNIX felt like this old OS that had been

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,940
around forever and all these old

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:24,200
Greybeards were at the USENIX

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:28,820
conferences at that point UNIX was about

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:32,150
20 years old or started in 71 we were

00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,670
starting in 91 so we have now more

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,770
history that UNIX had back then does

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,860
that frighten you

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:46,190
no I actually when you put it that way

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:48,680
it sounds odd it's it's not how I really

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:51,530
think I have I have the memory of a

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,860
goldfish I remember about five minutes

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:56,450
back in time the 25 years ago it's kind

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,750
of hazy by the way hi I'm Dirk

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:03,140
yeah hi good he knows I'm particularly

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,090
bad with faces and names so if you feel

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,820
like I should know you and I did not say

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:12,050
hi to you outside it's because I have no

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:14,330
idea who you are and that's happy now

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,350
let's let's switch to one of your

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:20,750
favorite topics security oh yeah so

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,910
those of us who live in the US or who

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,200
have any business dealings in the u.s.

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,160
of course are super excited about

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,460
Equifax

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,340
my my favorite company right now if you

00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,920
if you see the impact that lapses and

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,740
security have on all of our lives has

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,110
that in any way changed your I don't

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,600
want to say attitude but maybe that is

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,880
the right turn you approach to security

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,240
and thinking about security people and

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,440
and you know this is a PG audience so

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,180
please

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,430
security people don't tend to be my

00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,290
favorite kind of people and that's don't

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,810
get me wrong that's not because I don't

00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:01,390
like security it's because a lot of the

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:05,150
security community is about this whole

00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,370
look at me I found a bug I'm I want to

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,260
spread the word about how great I am

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,220
because that's how they bring in

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:16,270
business if you're in a security company

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,270
being this kind of

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:26,070
self-serving person is often a way to be

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:28,650
do marketing and and I realized that the

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,350
good security people in the audience now

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,270
should probably feel like that's not me

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,160
but suddenly the good security people

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,190
are the ones that you don't see because

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,860
they don't do this thing right so

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:45,000
security people often annoy me

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,220
that said I mean there's no question

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,100
it's important and I'm actually very

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:57,390
happy we we've had a lot of what I find

00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:00,990
very healthy the the random testing I'm

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:05,760
a huge believer in fussing and and part

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:08,610
of that is because I'm a huge believer

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,780
in testing but and not so much reading

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:15,270
code I think it's way too easy to miss

00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,340
very obvious things when you read code

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,350
because the code looks obvious and

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,630
there's an obvious bug there that you

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,850
missed because it looks so obvious so

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,550
testing is the only way to find most

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,430
things but most security bugs send some

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:33,000
end up being in in these code paths that

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:36,620
no sane person ever tests and fussing

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,920
tends to be a great way to try to

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:45,030
automate that insane behavior and I

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:48,510
think the kernel community has are

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:51,000
particularly a few big companies you

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,250
guys know who you are have been very

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,020
active in creating fussing tools for

00:14:53,250 --> 00:15:02,600
areas that we didn't necessarily do that

00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:07,050
well on before all the device driver

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,900
testing by fussing bogus devices has

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,510
been really good it's found a number of

00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,820
bugs

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:17,460
most of them those bugs are pretty hard

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,890
to exploit it's often things where you

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,440
have to have a specially crafted USB

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:25,260
stick that lies to the operating system

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,510
and if you happen to use that USB stick

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,390
and and put it in your laptop it takes

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,580
over your laptop

00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,490
if if the colonel does something wrong

00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,010
but this is the kind of testing that

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:39,070
that I think is actually very effective

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:42,010
so we're doing better I mean we're I'm

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,020
not claiming we're perfect in any in any

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,060
way but but I do think we're doing

00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,400
better I think we have made tremendous

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,580
progress the last five six years and I

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,290
also think that our attitude has changed

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,870
ours as the whole kernel community there

00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,340
is a lot more attention to this and a

00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,530
lot more a lot more willingness to

00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,250
listen to people who come with new ideas

00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:04,450
and and to bring up concerns we we also

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,950
I'd like to call out not just the

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:11,680
fussing there's a lot of tooling that I

00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:18,310
have to admit five six years ago I was

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:20,410
not that that optimistic about we've had

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,980
tooling that helped us find things like

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,740
locking bugs lock Depp has been

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,570
incredibly powerful for us to do good

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,900
locking and find when we do locking

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:38,050
wrong but now we're having a lot of

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:42,460
these compiler tools that automates

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:44,370
other classes of bug finding and case on

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:48,550
and and other things have been very

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:51,970
powerful in in finding bugs that no

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,950
human would ever find so let's switch

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,950
gear a little bit and not talk about the

00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,930
next for a moment looking at community

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,670
projects and I truly mean community

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:06,699
projects so not things like Android why

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,250
are some areas in which open-source

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,680
communities pop up very very successful

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:15,550
the kernel being of course the poster

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:19,630
child and others aren't what makes it so

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:21,820
unique that some open source projects

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:26,760
take over the world but the vast

00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:29,290
majority of them never really take off I

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,960
still actually think so I used to say

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,910
that nobody would ever do an open source

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,220
database because databases are horribly

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,500
boring and I still think database is

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,270
horribly boring but I was clearly wrong

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,250
because people do do open source

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,980
databases

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:49,440
but I do think that the open-source

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,440
projects that tend to be most successful

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,880
are the ones that are good at finding

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,720
commonalities a lot of it is about

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,730
infrastructure which turns out databases

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,490
actually fit in that thing but a lot of

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,820
it and so I think being about things

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,460
where there's really easy to find

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:13,750
agreement so kernel is something

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:17,970
everybody needs and there are not that

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,970
many arguments about what the needs are

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,860
when you go over to some more user

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,360
visible things you eyes and things like

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,400
that suddenly people disagree a lot more

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,160
about what's the right thing to do

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,380
so I think one of the reasons that that

00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,780
technical particularly technical

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:40,420
projects tend to flourish very very well

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,480
in open-source is that that when you

00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,670
have a very technical area you also you

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,940
can show real numbers you can say this

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:52,960
is the way the right way and and it's

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:55,120
much easier to find a community and in

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,750
agreement around that then there

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,080
necessarily is in some other areas but

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,970
you also need to have a big enough

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,000
community I mean we've seen that in

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:09,580
dialog software it turns out dialogue

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,690
software is not a huge community so it's

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:16,120
hard to grow a big open-source projects

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,910
around die blogging while everybody

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,820
needs the kernel everybody needs source

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:26,380
control not everybody needs to log their

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:28,380
scuba diving sounds really yeah but

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,540
let's talk about this what does make a

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,700
project successful or actually how would

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,910
you measure where their project is

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,250
successful I actually don't like

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:44,260
thinking in those terms because that's

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,880
not why I do any of my work I mean who

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,880
cares if something is successful or not

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,990
that's not the big issue the big issue

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,690
is whether it's interesting and whether

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,350
he does what do you want it to do

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,760
and in the end it is successful if it

00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,760
does something you wanted to do whether

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,880
it has five users or 50 million users

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,340
who cares in the end right but that then

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,620
gets us straight to the question what

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,240
makes a good developer or what is it

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,700
that that drives a good developer I

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,740
really don't think there's one answer

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,260
the open source community when I started

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,470
was much more homogeneous than it is

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,470
today

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:35,400
there were the geeky white male with

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:37,830
often a beard right and and we all did

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,450
things that no sane person should be

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,420
interested in and I think that has

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:48,150
changed there's a lot more I mean it's

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:49,920
not like it's diverse but but you have

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,650
people who come into the community

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,870
because they're interested in actual

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,090
graphical design or documentation or all

00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,700
these things that did not exist when I

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,820
started I think at least I never saw

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,800
them and and I don't think there is any

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,740
particularly one thing I mean I can I

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,390
can guess at what makes somebody a good

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,340
programmer if you started programming

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,940
when you were 10 or 11 you're probably a

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,620
good programmer right that's that's what

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,630
he takes it takes a decade or more of

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,040
doing something and that's true of

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,510
pretty much everything I don't think

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,030
that's really really limited to

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:29,400
programming but I actually think from

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:32,490
that you can derive a little bit of what

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,230
I consider key criteria there needs to

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,840
be something that you care about and

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,750
that you're willing to invest in long

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,950
time and 25 years of doing the kernel

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:46,230
and also it has to be fun for you if you

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,750
as a developer find developing software

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,880
miserable I don't think you will ever

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,700
turn into a good developer I agree I

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,200
mean definitely I at the same time I

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,680
really don't think that has anything to

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,770
do with programming or doing projects I

00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,870
mean if you want to be an athlete the

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:07,350
same thing has to be true right I'm not

00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,550
one and I never will be because I don't

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:13,310
find it find

00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:16,200
interesting I accept my extra baggage

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,000
but but it's true probably in marketing

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:26,430
- you probably need to actually enjoy

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:28,920
talking to people okay so speaking of

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,500
developers there is a topic that I know

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,470
you love to talk about and and so I'll

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,900
ask my next question very specifically

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:40,370
explain your recent love for C++ because

00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:47,990
I got C++ patches from you just recently

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:52,140
now I suspect if I start swearing on

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:55,500
don't know keep girls like this no no I

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,260
G it's all PG because all PG no no it's

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,530
a lovely language let's let's leave it

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,320
at that I I did wonder how anybody could

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:07,140
ever develop anything in in that when it

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,240
takes so long to just build stuff I mean

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,240
a small file takes a couple of seconds

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,990
to build I would never be able to live

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,760
that way

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,400
yeah we were as we were sitting in the

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,800
hotel room and he made a change to a C++

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:25,170
file in rebuild subsurface and said my

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:28,410
kernel compiles faster than this okay

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:31,230
and a very related question do you like

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,530
providing and user support because that

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:38,250
you also do which I find fascinating

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:40,860
given your otherwise public persona

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,510
now I actually don't do end-user support

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,150
if you're talking about my family they'd

00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:47,430
like to disagree with you I'm talking

00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,110
about you responding to a lot of

00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,750
requests we get on the subsurface

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,420
mailing list for random users who have

00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:57,390
very simple problems and leanness is our

00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:59,670
top supporter this I know it's it's

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,410
yours ax even though I'm not actually a

00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:03,210
people person I'll be the first to say

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,010
that I don't recognize people and I

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,050
don't like talking to you guys over

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,170
email it's different one of the reasons

00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:12,300
I got into Linux or why I continued

00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:16,440
getting into likes let's put it that way

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:19,500
is I actually like interacting with

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,890
people over technical matters and I do

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,080
not mind bug triage and

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:27,500
like that at all and it turns out in the

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,010
kernel I no longer ever do that there is

00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:34,880
I mean by the time something hits my

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:37,190
inbox on Colonel issues it's already

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,890
gone through bug triage through three

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,770
levels of people and it's probably

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:46,370
something really nasty and there's no

00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:48,410
way I want to interact with his IT

00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:51,260
person had a company who sees odd

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,150
behavior no but but sometimes it's nice

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,780
to have a small project not like

00:24:53,150 --> 00:25:01,010
subsurface but also get was a when I

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:03,280
started get it's over ten years ago now

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:06,440
but it was actually relaxing and

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:10,310
interesting to do something small with

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:13,220
small problems right so I still enjoy

00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:16,820
that part in the on the kernel side I

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,250
don't do any programming I end up

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,730
spending all my time just reading email

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:26,960
and pulling patches from people and and

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:29,960
honestly it wouldn't really make much

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,410
sense for me to do anything else but but

00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,450
it it is kind of nice to also have a

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:39,350
different project where you actually do

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,430
look at code and where I'm no longer one

00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,370
of the main maintainer

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:47,570
but I still am one of the people who

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:49,100
knows pretty much everything works but

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,590
that brings me to my next question so

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,890
why do you do what you do and ignore the

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:57,290
fact that impes you but what is it that

00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,080
makes you go back every morning and go

00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,090
through hundreds of emails and dozens of

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:09,560
pull requests and and keep doing this

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:13,400
for 25 years it is a very long time are

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:16,010
you still like the technology I still

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,530
actually like the people again despite

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:22,160
sometimes my negative emails being the

00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:27,830
ones that are showcased I really enjoy

00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:31,010
interacting with people I like doing

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:34,550
something that is meaningful the kernel

00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,700
matters to a lot of people being in

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,340
charge of a project

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,620
that is something that people care about

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:46,860
is something that gives your life

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:50,309
meaning right it's not it's not

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,860
necessarily the thing that gets me up in

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:55,320
the morning but I would be really really

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,260
bored if I didn't do kernel development

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:02,250
so I ended up going away for a week at a

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:09,630
time usually doing scuba diving but I do

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:11,730
end up even when I'm on vacation I read

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:15,210
email at least three times a day just

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:18,240
because if I don't do that I just fall

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:22,440
behind too much and then occasionally

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,299
very occasionally I tell drag and a

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,070
couple of other people at hey guys I'm

00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:30,570
actually going to be completely

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:33,690
incommunicado for a week or two and and

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:35,789
that's an odd time for me I mean that's

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,580
usually when I'm somewhere where there

00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:42,809
is no internet at all and after a week

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:46,019
I'm so ready to get back because that's

00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:48,929
my life doing Linux and yeah the hamster

00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:51,120
will keep spinning and so I know how

00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:53,639
much you like to do predictions so I

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,590
have to have a prediction question and I

00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,389
try to come up with one that I haven't

00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,070
asked you before and given that we have

00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:02,250
done this a few times it's becoming

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:04,289
harder so what is the most surprising

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:07,130
thing that will happen in the next in

00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,130
the next year

00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:22,800
that is not how I really work to me

00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:25,680
every day is a new day and maybe it's

00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:30,480
the incipient Alzheimer's but more of it

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:33,930
is that I don't really plan ahead I kind

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,900
of know what's coming in a very big view

00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,970
where just because I do end up talking

00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,940
to both hardware companies and obviously

00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:44,160
to a developer the developers who plan

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,480
what and talk about what they're working

00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:52,370
on but at the same time most of my life

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:57,090
ends up being reacting not so much

00:28:52,370 --> 00:29:00,690
predicting what's coming up so I'm very

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:05,700
comfortable in having the the flow that

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:07,920
we have and not trying to to make the

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,560
next big thing happen but to make sure

00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,310
that we're doing the best we can every

00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,320
day and I don't know what what will

00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:17,460
we'll be doing in one year but I don't

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,650
think we're changing that much

00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,960
fundamentally anymore I have been

00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,370
surprised before though so so then I'll

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,130
ask you about something that you

00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:28,710
actually fully control and most likely

00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:34,170
can mathematically predict so when are

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:37,980
we going to get Linux 5-0 oh well I have

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:41,700
I have been known to start losing track

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,260
of numbers when they go into the 20s and

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,810
30s fingers and toes

00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:49,290
yeah now I yeah when I had to take off

00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:53,040
my shoes to count kernel releases

00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:55,770
no it's it's psychological for me it

00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,900
turns out 13 and 14 they're easy to

00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:00,270
remember but when you're looking back

00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:04,740
and you can't recall the difference

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:07,860
within 23 and 24 or the the numbers

00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:12,330
smaller numbers stand out more so I

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:15,330
suspect that we'll hit 4.19 and and

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:18,210
instead of 4.20 I might decide it's time

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:21,330
to 55.0 the numbers don't mean anything

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,870
at all they have not meant anything in a

00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,660
long

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,920
time it was actually very stressful went

00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:31,470
back when they did it was a horrible

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:36,110
model for development I remember I mean

00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:39,660
even back in the 1.0 days just trying to

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:43,740
like draw the line in the water in the

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:46,080
sand of this is 1.0 and this is when

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,080
that our internet code is actually

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:53,070
working it was really tough and very

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:57,510
stressful and then you never end up

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:59,550
doing the right decision anyway so jet

00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,470
is something that entirely and saying no

00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,510
the numbers don't mean anything they do

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,640
keep incrementing but we just try to

00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:08,400
make them sound like easier to remember

00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,920
then then any other kind of

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,770
meaningfulness has made my life much

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,470
easier and I think pretty much everybody

00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:19,679
enjoys it now but then there are still a

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:23,460
few people when I make 5.0 and they

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,820
expect lots of new features disappointed

00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:31,200
yes if I get my math right that means

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:34,140
next summer ish probably I also did some

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:39,150
numerology and decided that every two

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:43,170
million get objects is when when I need

00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:45,990
to do a new major release but since our

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:47,850
development is accelerating that

00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:51,809
actually might be sooner than next

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:53,610
summer so it really depends on I it's a

00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:55,890
random number and I want people to be

00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,929
aware that it's a random number and has

00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,670
no meaning well then you could jump to

00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,770
six that oh and just confuse everyone

00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:05,550
oh that would that is actually a great

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:09,140
idea and on that and our time is up

00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,140
thank you very much for your attention

00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,410
