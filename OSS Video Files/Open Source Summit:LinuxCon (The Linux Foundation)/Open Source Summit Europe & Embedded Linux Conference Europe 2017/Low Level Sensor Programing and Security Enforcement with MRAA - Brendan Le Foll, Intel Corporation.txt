	Low Level Sensor Programing and Security Enforcement with MRAA - Brendan Le Foll, Intel Corporation

MRAA is and it's companion library UPM is already enabling thousands of developers to control sensors and control devices in a platform independent way. Even Arduino is now using it on Linux based boards. With over 300 sensors supported by the libraries - it has become an easy way to add sensor support to large frameworks and OSs. When stringent security requirements mandate the use of arbiters between any operation with the real world mraa has been successfully adapted to suit those needs. I will then describe how the model has evolved to support remote sensor running on Arduino & FTDI hardware, then on Android of Things and more recently on AGL. A more detailed look at the last evolution will explain how the power of MRAA associated with AGL development tools offer a novel approach to sensor and control programming in a secured environment.

About Brendan Le Foll
Brendan holds a degree from the University of Kent, as a student he was the maintainer for the Meego TV reference UI. He started his careers at Intel UK in the customer enabling group, the success of MRAA and the Intel IoT developer kit allowed him to join the Intel Open Source group where he worked on the Yocto project focusing on I/O and javascript technologies in Linux embedded applications. He recently moved to Intel Germany to focus on development tools for IoT & embedded.
