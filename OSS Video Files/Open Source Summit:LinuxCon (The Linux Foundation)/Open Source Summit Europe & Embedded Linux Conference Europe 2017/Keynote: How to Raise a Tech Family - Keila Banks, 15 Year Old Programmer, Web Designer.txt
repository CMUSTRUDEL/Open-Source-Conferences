Description: 
	Keynote: How to Raise a Tech Family - Keila Banks, 15 Year Old Programmer, Web Designer and Technologist with her father Phillip Banks 

For any system to survive it must figure out how to bring in new members. In this keynote, you'll hear from Keila Banks who since 11 years old (now 15) has been speaking at conferences around the world; and her father Phillip Banks, who's been programming since he was 10 and provided the same path for his children. Along with 3 other sons, they have all been a part of technology efforts and open source communities since their youth. Hear from a teen how you can help grow open source communities and youth involvement from what we've learned along the way.

About Keila Banks
Keila Banks is a 15 year old programmer, web designer, entrepreneur and international speaker. She started programming at 9 and has been traveling the world speaking on being a young girl in tech. At age 12 she won the Young Entreprenuer of the year award beating out people much older than her. Since then, she’s been recognized by the mayor of Los Angeles, Long Beach California and presented in 2016 at the White House as an example of great things our youth are doing in technology. Coming from a tech family, she loves and embraces many forms of technology without letting it get in the way of just having fun being a kid.

hi everybody my name is caleb banks i'm

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:12,929
15 years old and this is my crazy hi I'm

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,170
Philip banks and I'm her dad not the

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,779
crazy part so we're getting here to talk

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,270
about kind of what Jim hit on is how to

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,550
raise a family in tech but it's so much

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,320
more than that it's about getting young

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,849
people into the community and kind of

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,099
what we're doing and kind of best

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,529
practices and things I want you to get

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,719
about what you can do to bring more

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,520
young people in the family I mean in the

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:42,120
community because how diverse are you if

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,660
you're not considering youth its we have

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,809
so many women's and ethnic diversity

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,210
efforts but not enough youth and to add

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,219
on to that how diverse really is your

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,600
community if you don't bring in youth we

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,520
like to think our communities are

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,949
diverse because we include women and

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,750
different people of color and even at

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,180
the Women's Open Source lunch we were

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,659
talking about how you know who decides

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,810
what's diverse and the most overlooked

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,760
group is youth we're literally hacking

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,890
into unix linux kernel's

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,080
hacking in a minecraft making games

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:21,930
we're the most overlooked group and and

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,009
like a whole bunch of programs like for

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,450
one example I use a popular program I'm

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,079
pretty sure most you guys I've heard of

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,119
it it's called slack and I used this to

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,310
collaborate among teams around the world

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,799
and we were approaching it slack about

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,930
what we're doing we found out that we

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,079
legally aren't even able to use slack

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,820
because we're underage and there's a lot

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,950
of platforms like this that put age

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,430
restrictions and we literally are

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,149
stopping in the tech community from

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,610
progressing because these eight

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,439
restrictions so our talk has changed

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,689
like 10 times listen to a lot of the

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,969
good talks at this conference Anna and

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,860
we were we thought of that one because a

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,590
guy Martin did a talk yesterday about

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,129
slack in community and we had a story

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,470
about slack and just in for slacks

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,360
purposes we could also say we talked to

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,300
them and they're trying to lower the age

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,890
limits

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,300
so that younger people can use it so we

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,430
wanted to start out talking a little bit

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,920
about who we are and why we're here but

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,020
Jim hit on most of this stuff but I'll

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,630
introduce our tech family over to the

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,930
right is my my son Phillip he's the

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,930
oldest he's 28 and he's a sysadmin

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,010
and IT guy at school then we got hunter

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,390
right next to him

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:43,420
he's a video game developer and if you

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,690
google open source gaming you'll see a

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,150
lot of hunters posts over to the left we

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,730
have my son David he's wants to be a

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,100
surgeon but somehow we're gonna tech

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,720
that up I don't know we're building

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,400
cyborgs there's something we got tell

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,130
this boy we're gonna we're gonna work

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,890
with brain since connections and then we

00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,080
got at the bottom my daughter Kayla and

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,760
I think you've met her but tell us a

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,520
little bit more about you Kayla

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,680
well like Jim was saying I've been

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,410
speaking at conferences since I was 11

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,600
years old and this was my biggest one at

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,750
O'Reilly's özkan which I did the keynote

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,209
and that one was a group of about five

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,590
four thousand people in the room but

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,840
really it reached a bigger audience

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,350
because that's all kind of went viral

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,360
and I also had the pleasure of visiting

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:38,440
the White House under President Obama

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:42,670
and it's a lot different there now

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:46,120
I was also featured at the Melissa

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,000
harris-perry show and we also got to go

00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:55,050
to the mayor of Los Angeles and that's

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:59,440
also the CTO yeah chief technology

00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:01,959
school is another picture a chief for

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,820
diversity the chief chief technology

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,670
officer for the United States of America

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,280
is a woman for a woman want to know that

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,440
so so it was a great role model for my

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:17,200
daughter I'm just meeting her and

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,790
talking about being in her position so

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,060
the first thing we want to talk about is

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:25,250
how we do things how what's what's our

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,290
method so Kayla how do we engage

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,330
what do we use engagement well as I

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,060
mentioned earlier I'm 15 so I still go

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,980
to school and every ride to school we

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,620
usually have a discussion whether it's a

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,380
debate or just a regular conversation

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,210
about a whole different bunch of

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,960
different topics and usually we try to

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,520
relate it around tech and I feel that

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,660
like having these talks on the way to

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,910
school on the way home

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,460
it makes us engage like the reason why

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,590
kids like the stuff is because it

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,540
pertains to us we're not just going to

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,790
you know write a whole bunch of code

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,010
just for the purpose of it it has to

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,590
relate to us and I think engagement is a

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:08,240
crucial part in involving youth in the

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:10,460
tech community so we we believe in a lot

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,530
of reverse engineering and I think that

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,320
gets a lot of youth involved in

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:19,310
something and it's whatever thing that

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,169
they like to do so at Southern

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,970
California Linux Expo where I'm one of

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,280
the chairs there and my kids have been

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,840
involved since the beginning what

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,419
sixteen years ago we get we started to

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,710
implement more youth programs and we're

00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:37,250
starting to get more high schools to

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:40,100
come and and you'll find that you ask

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,110
them to reverse engineer stuff and just

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,490
think how does that work how did we get

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,910
that there how do we get that it and

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,540
then it gets them started on a path that

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:52,760
will get them to every community we have

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,710
even some kids that are kind of kernel

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,380
developers and I mean one who were just

00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,120
like idolizes Linus Torvalds and so he's

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,600
like you gotta talk to them when you get

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,700
there so we you get that engagement and

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,000
then you get them started and then sky's

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,000
the limit

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:13,880
next is goals what do we do with gold

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,590
well goals are a huge part of our year

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,300
and when I say goals I'm not just

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,710
talking about New Year's resolutions

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,530
that everyone sets and forgets about

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,870
during the year the goals that we set we

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,030
try to tend to send ten goals a goal

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,100
that we make for ourselves and two goals

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,960
that our dad sets and most of the time

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,900
their tech goals each year I try to

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,580
learn a new language and but although

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,590
they're not always tech they're always

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,559
they're also like personal and physical

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,529
and emotional

00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:43,709
and these girls make me strive to be a

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:47,399
better person like last year my goal was

00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:50,789
to learn JavaScript more and teach more

00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:53,549
kids and I was able to do that a lot of

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:55,949
times will feel like man we're slacking

00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:58,139
but when you start looking at those

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,509
goals and we do like every three or four

00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:03,449
months we do review of your pace on your

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:05,489
goals and until the kids you know me oh

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,249
I've said two of their goals they can

00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:09,779
set eight goals for the year but we'll

00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:11,699
set two because you know you kind of

00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,679
want to guide their course so if you're

00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,849
mentoring or are you working with youth

00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:19,949
or nieces nephews then having them have

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:22,709
some investment in their own goals is

00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:26,549
the key thing because you know then they

00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:34,829
think stop bossing me around I'm kind of

00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:37,999
doing this myself so we the thing with

00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:43,439
getting youth into our communities is

00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:45,539
the barriers you feel fear in doing

00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,249
something with adults and you know and a

00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,529
lot of people I always ask Kayla like

00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:52,199
you're not terrified being in front of a

00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:54,719
lot of people that are dull you know the

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,449
kid are the kids audiences you know easy

00:07:54,719 --> 00:08:01,199
and she's always done adult audiences

00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:03,689
tell us about embracing the fear well

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,119
one particular story is when I was 12

00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:09,659
years old my first big audience was at

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:12,719
PyCon in Montreal and it was a lightning

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:14,789
talk and when my dad told me was you can

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:18,109
get up on the stage you can completely

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:20,609
fall just trip over this whole stage and

00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:22,499
one thing to remember to do is just

00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:24,359
laugh at yourself and I guess that

00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,649
advice worked out because I'm here

00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:29,969
speaking in front of all of you guys

00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:31,819
today so if we trip or anything on this

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:33,899
stage we are gonna laugh at ourselves

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:37,709
we've loved any lies

00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:40,439
believe it's gonna happen yes so that

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:43,259
one if we pretty much said like the fear

00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:46,290
of of doing stuff a lot of the young

00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,959
developers they are afraid of even

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,699
submitting coder or entering in a lot of

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,050
these things because like one of the

00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:53,660
kids

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,600
was a kernel developer he he said you

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,630
know his code getting rejected was like

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,450
the biggest thing to him and yet I was

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,210
like go back go go there again keep

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:09,770
doing that and once they get over that

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:11,540
then they can do everything and so

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,850
that's why I tell them every project

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,630
isn't your first one your your best one

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,820
you know it's some things go wrong and

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,430
interviewing a lot of programmers before

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,650
they you know spoke at our conferences

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,510
the conference's we've been at one of

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,460
the main things asked him you know is

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,320
like how did you get started a lot of

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,780
them said I wanted you to make a video

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,000
game somewhere along the line that

00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,310
didn't work and I remembered that was my

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,040
first thing when I was 10 I wanted to be

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,450
like a video game so I learned that

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,050
didn't work but it led me into so many

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,870
other way places comparing yourself to

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,080
no one Kayla tell me about that and

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,340
another thing that ties into this is

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,690
imposter syndrome I'm a victim of

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,030
imposter syndrome and I know a lot of

00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,180
people in the tech community are victims

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,920
of it too on the way here it was an 11

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,350
hour flight and I'm sitting here

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,690
thinking on mine like why am I being

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,400
able to fly all the way to Prague like

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,490
I'm not as smart as most of the people

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,460
in this room and literally when I was

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,380
sitting in and on fosters talk yesterday

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,180
like five people raised their hand and

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:20,210
said that they contributed to the Linux

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,340
kernel like we're literally contributing

00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,220
to the Linux kernel and I'm pretty sure

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,620
a lot of people are capable or have

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,510
already done stuff like this so I have

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,510
to constantly remind myself to compare

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,940
myself to no one and instead motivate

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,670
myself or inspired by other people like

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,820
Reuben for example who had a great talk

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,100
oh yeah I was a great talk if you mr.

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,070
Rubens talk you know seeing a young kid

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,980
11 years old if I'm correct still 11

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,540
right yeah and him getting up on stage

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,970
and saying all the stuff that he's doing

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,380
if he's not in your community if you're

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,320
not you're looking at him like yeah that

00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,579
was nothing Danny you know your

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,980
community is

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:02,980
it's not as diverse as you need it to be

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,329
the biggest thing about this one for me

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,160
and I don't know if you have some more

00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:15,529
on this one - Kayla is that adults oh

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,689
the one thing I we we work with a lot of

00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:21,199
students now we've started programs

00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:23,660
around LA and hopefully around the world

00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:26,410
so well we're dealing with a lot of

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:30,439
young people that are averse to tech

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:33,170
from the start and to get them from

00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:35,629
ground zero to where you you know where

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,809
they want to be is a hard thing because

00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:42,069
I know with my own kids I had to you

00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:44,600
know stop monitoring them and in

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,689
micromanaging them and thinking they

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,579
have to take the same path as me

00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:51,319
they take everybody takes a whole

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:53,779
different path to where they want to be

00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:55,879
so if you do it your way

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:58,670
they're different than you and so we're

00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,529
that's our big thing with schools did we

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,540
learn anything like that with some of

00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:06,889
the students at some of the schools yes

00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,959
like my dad mentioned we've been working

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:11,689
with schools and most of the time we

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:14,360
realize that a lot of these kids tend to

00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:16,399
just need a bit of motivation and from

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,739
on there you have your own self

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,749
motivation and I think that's crucial

00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:23,419
and even going to conferences like this

00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:25,489
I tend to get triggered and have a whole

00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:28,129
bunch of self motivation even go into

00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:29,779
some of the booths like Red Hat and all

00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:31,220
the other ones I go home and with all

00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,989
these papers nothing like what am I

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:38,029
gonna learn next like what am I going to

00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:39,529
program yes and a lot of the people at

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:41,540
the booths of the clouds and boots on

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,339
our new thing is kubernetes so we're

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,809
just like what is that and so he's

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,419
probably stopped by a ton of your bugs

00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:49,489
and grab your ear a gang at times about

00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:52,059
that because when high school kids that

00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:55,220
started learning that kind of thing so

00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:57,559
from there we start taking it to the

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,549
next level so where do we want to go

00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,829
from there Kayla

00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:02,029
they're probably asking themselves okay

00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:04,699
you told us a lot about what you're

00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:08,329
doing a lot of things that you know we

00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:11,389
could do what's next what's our what are

00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,380
what are we doing well we're not mostly

00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:14,720
focused on ourselves

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,150
now now we're starting to focus on other

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,460
kids getting other kids involved and so

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,810
as you can see right now we're teaching

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,880
at schools and we're starting our own

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:26,330
company called banks family Tech which

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,660
is gonna be on Facebook soon and during

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:33,140
the summer of La we taught at parent

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,940
Middle School and Tom Bradley middle

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,550
school and as you can see some things

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,800
are some of our kids and teaching

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,770
basically is the next generation like we

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,680
said youth they're the overlooked group

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,630
and so directly reaching out to this

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,640
group of teaching them you know you got

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,500
to be the part of you've got to be the

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,230
new generation of the tech community and

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,440
this is part of our teaching at school

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,330
yeah you does some of these are even

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,080
young this is a class of fifth graders

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:04,940
and I I don't like to put down any

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,520
languages in particular because

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,050
everything serves purpose but we do

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,980
programs where they're actually learning

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,260
real code because that is a lot of stem

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,850
programs science technology engineering

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:22,430
and math programs in the United States

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,010
are focused on just saying we're

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,020
teaching some coding and we're not big

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,550
fans that you know like one of the

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,170
things I really loved about Rubin

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,900
Stalkings he was he was doing some

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,540
Python right in his it and young kids

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,870
can learn this now a lot of times we use

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,700
things like scratch is a language that

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,680
it's like scratching a chalkboard for me

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:49,490
to hear because they're not really

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:53,420
learning life applicable languages so so

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:56,420
we're teaching in schools and what do we

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,970
want to do from there we we want you to

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,030
our next thing was like how do you get

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,310
involved we want there's so many tech

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,090
minds in this room that can that can

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:10,580
give back to the communities there's if

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,130
everyone in here multiplied that

00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,220
knowledge at one school just going to

00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:20,330
one group of kids and getting one kid

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:24,140
involved imagine how many kids around

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,990
this world will be because I only tell

00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,029
them this

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,709
is just a tool you can do whatever you

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,440
want in life there's some people that

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,540
were graphic design and that's what my

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,029
son Hunter it's my son Hunter teaching

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,000
is these two schools that's my son David

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:42,029
down there helping with Hunter was more

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,899
graphic design applied it to video game

00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:51,209
design so how are we gonna that's how

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:53,070
you can get involved and help us so now

00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:55,380
Kayla made this I said tell me tell us

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,870
about this one Kayla so this light is

00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,399
they can dedicate it to our community as

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,560
I mentioned earlier we live in Los

00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,850
Angeles but even all the way on the

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,950
other side of the world

00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:11,100
we literally have so many familiar faces

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:14,190
like me and that's our friend guy and

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,310
Adrian and all these people and so being

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,990
in tech really enables a community and

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,440
that's what we're trying to put portray

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:24,839
and yeah these are all awesome if you a

00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,149
lot of the people we've seen here today

00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,880
so I gotta say we've changed his side so

00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:32,640
many times seeing so many new faces you

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,829
know nithya talks and Kayla and the

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,529
woman's in tech talk came out with a

00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:38,970
couple new friends and and then I was

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,370
like different people we didn't even

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:46,079
know we're here you know John oh you see

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:49,890
we see him in every city or if it stops

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,440
at the house and of course our new

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:58,230
friend Angela's here running this

00:16:52,440 --> 00:17:00,660
conferencing and so community so having

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,540
my kids in this community all this time

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,280
there's so many people we can we I mean

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,990
even when we went to the White House we

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,000
there was people across the road like

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,339
hey there's so-and-so and they're in the

00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,900
tech community and then they offer their

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,179
advice there's anything if they know

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,420
them but imagine if more kids are

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,160
involved and get these contacts and

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,110
everything like like some of our young

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,089
programmers like Rubin get these

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,240
contacts and then they help them and

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,460
they help develop them as programmers

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:35,620
and as developers is design

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:37,389
engineers so now with all that what are

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,029
they gonna do they gonna reach out to us

00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:43,120
yeah you guys gonna reach out to us you

00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:45,820
guys gonna hey guys gonna contact us on
