	Using Long Term Stable Kernel for the Embedded Products - Tsugikazu Shibata, NEC

Many of embedded industry people know that LTS and LTSI is the default choice of Linux Kernel for their real products because of bug and security fixes will be provided by the community in long years. Broad range of industries are using LTS and LTSI already for their own products such as Automotive, Android, TV and so on. LTSI project was born in 2011 at Embedded Linux Conference in Europe (especially it was at Prague!) and now the project is running 6 years. This presentation is to share what we learned in past 6 years such as; best practice to maintain patches for the products and continue to apply bug and security fixes provided by the community, Problem owning in-house patches even on top of LTS. Also, we will present latest development and LTS statistics of Linux, and finally, we would like to discuss about development plan for 2018.
