	Keynote: Challenges in Industrializing OSS and How Siemens Tackles Them - Jan Kiszka, Senior Key Expert, Siemens AGÂ 

Deploying Open Source software, including though not only Linux, into industrial environments creates a number of challenges. While some of them are common to many domains, some remain specific. This talk will walk through topics like the need for stable code bases and their long-term maintenance, upstream first and open-sourcing strategies, license compliance efforts as well as change management aspects when not only using but trying to breath Open Source in an industrial environment like Siemens is covering.
