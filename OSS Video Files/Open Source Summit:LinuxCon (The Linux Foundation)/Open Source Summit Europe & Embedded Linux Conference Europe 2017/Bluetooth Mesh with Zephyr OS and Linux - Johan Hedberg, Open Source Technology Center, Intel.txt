	Bluetooth Mesh with Zephyr OS and Linux - Johan Hedberg, Open Source Technology Center, Intel

Bluetooth Mesh is a new standard that opens a whole new wave of low-power wireless use cases. It extends the range of communication from a single peer-to-peer connection to a true mesh topology covering large areas, such as an entire building. This paves the way for both home and industrial automation applications. Typical home scenarios include things like controlling the lights in your apartment or adjusting the thermostat. Although Bluetooth 5 was released end of last year, Bluetooth Mesh can be implemented on any device supporting Bluetooth 4.0 or later. This means that we'll likely see very rapid market adoption of the feature.

The presentation will give an introduction to Bluetooth Mesh, covering how it works and what kind of features it provides. The talk will also give an overview of Bluetooth Mesh support in Zephyr OS and Linux and how to create wireless solutions with them.

About Johan Hedberg
I've been hacking on Linux for many years, both on my free time and professionally. I spent many years working on the Maemo and MeeGo projects at Nokia, and for the past five years my employer has been the Open Source Technology Center at Intel. I'm a maintainer for the Linux kernel Bluetooth subsystem and the BlueZ project, as well as the architect & lead developer for Bluetooth on Zephyr. I've presented at various Linux Foundation conferences in the past (Maemo/MeeGo, Tizen, ELC, etc).
