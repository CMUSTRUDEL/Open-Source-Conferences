	WPE WebKit: HTML5 User Interfaces for Embedded Devices - Juan José Sánchez Penas, Igalia, S.L.

WPE WebKit, a new WebKit Port optimized for Embedded platforms, has been released recently. WPE is designed for simplicity and performance: a hardware accelerated fullscreen browser with multimedia support, as small (both
in memory usage and disk space) and light as possible, and implementing the most relevant HTML APIs.

WPE is an open source project with a growing community, and it is developed within the ecosystem of the WebKit project, which powers many open source and proprietary web browsers.

In this talk we will explain what is WPE, how the project was born and has evolved, and why it is becoming very popular in embedded devices of many different kinds, where the manufacturers are looking for a simple and fast way of running their HTML5 user interfaces.
