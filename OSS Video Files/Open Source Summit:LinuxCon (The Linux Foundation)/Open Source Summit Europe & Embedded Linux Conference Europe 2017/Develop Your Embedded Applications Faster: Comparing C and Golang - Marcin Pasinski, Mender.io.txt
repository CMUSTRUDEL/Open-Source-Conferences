	Develop Your Embedded Applications Faster: Comparing C and Golang - Marcin Pasinski, Mender.io

As a strategy, time-to-market for embedded applications is nearly as obvious as maximizing scoring in a sports game. Thus we will focus on a more pragmatic approach for delivering applications faster while maintaining a quality-first approach. Specifically, we will compare and contrast Golang and C as programming languages for developing embedded applications.

We will also cover the learning curve for C programmers, as well as the key similarities and differences of C and Golang to provide context for developers considering a new language.

We will also demonstrate an example of a small embedded application with Go on a Yocto distribution with the BeagleBone with a new image deployment. As with any decision, it is rarely black-and-white and we will cover the trade-offs, to make sure you have the most critical information needed to decide.
