Publication date: 2017-10-25
Playlist: Open Source Summit Europe & Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2017
Description: 
	Asymmetric Multiprocessing and Embedded Linux - Marek Novak & Dušan Červenka, NXP Semiconductor; BUT FEEC Brno

Asymmetric Multiprocessing and Embedded Linux (Marek Novak, NXP Semiconductors) – The Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP) is a perspective method for handling multiple dedicated CPUs in a System on Chip (SoC). Remote Processor Messaging (RPMsg) is a thin layer on top of VirtIO component addressing the communication between different CPU cores. Marek Novak will present current state of art of this component in Linux kernel, the counterpart implementation for cores running RTOS or bare-metal (RPMsg-Lite). He will also present user-space “access” layers for AMP which notably consist of Embedded Remote Procedure Call (eRPC) open-source library.

About Marek Novak
I was born in 1991 in the Czech Republic, where I studied up to age of 15 years. At that time, I left to study in Dijon, France. I am an alumnus of BUT FEEC in Brno, Czech Republic and currently pursue my PhD studies in the field of fiber-less optical communications. I work in parallel for NXP Semiconductor, specifically on RPMsg component and Remoteproc. I am author of the erpc-imx-demos and rpmsg-lite repositories on Github. I speak English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Czech, Russian. (and C)

00:00:47,840 --> 00:01:14,450
so this girl then with our message like

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:17,939
optimize for braking systems devices and

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,300
we will end with a medical procedure

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,450
call every which is there

00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,450
[Music]

00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:40,320
so for support motivation why you use MP

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:45,420
under assembly so thanks to MP your

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,630
system can be faster or of course can

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:55,770
consume us power can be safer and can be

00:01:48,630 --> 00:02:01,260
much more secure now explain how this

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:04,460
can be so if you could affect that not

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:09,330
all CPUs this is the are treated equally

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:13,710
the course run independently they are

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,970
not under the same operating system but

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,930
they can have different operating

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:25,830
systems they can have different can be

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:28,890
able to get ESP forward and as they are

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,500
completely separate you can be used in

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,590
the mmm you can be also used in basic

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,490
Xfinity systems which means that on one

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:44,239
corner on rivers which is not certain

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:48,810
viable potential for occupations yes and

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:53,459
the other column can be support mp4 you

00:02:48,810 --> 00:03:02,250
can run an artisan which will take care

00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:05,820
of so in order to do to make the system

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,090
work you need the 2 part 2 system to

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,640
make it somehow for this there is a

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:18,030
shared memory and to entertain

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:21,890
interrupts one core is so-called master

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,480
and most of the time it takes care of

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:28,440
lifecycle the other core which means

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,230
that if name of the core

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,920
enables its are locked

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:38,130
and the course starts moving in some

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,200
scenarios it also is able to change the

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,680
firmware participant record but it

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,530
depends where is the secondary quality

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,300
provider it is from VR or external what

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,300
SPI flash or something else

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,650
another important thing is that in this

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:03,390
system or maybe this is getting a little

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:06,420
bit specific for which is used your

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,390
domestic but generally monitor is

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,850
managing the authorities so it is a

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,130
masters role to do table clocks for

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,620
shared memory to initialize it to

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:26,880
impersonate and in data structures which

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:29,880
are later useful so finally so our give

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,020
us your remote poster messaging it's a

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:38,610
very thin layer on top of transport

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:41,610
layer and actually defines just be like

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:47,640
header which contains source address

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:49,860
which is an address of an endpoint on on

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,080
the sender side on the side it is

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,970
sending the message this connection

00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:00,840
point which is like a UDP port again

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:05,400
this time you need on the side of the

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:08,070
other four and the other space of source

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,669
and destination is always hopeful to the

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,950
core this can be done like this thanks

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:16,560
to the fact that our message is

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,580
point-to-point protocol so Oasis between

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,370
one pair of

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,530
we use there is one instance supportive

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,740
RP FSG then there is a reserve field

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:34,180
which talked about now and then here is

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:50,789
plenty and like this this is one offer

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:55,479
transfer in the beginning layer which

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:58,240
was and still is based on portrayal this

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:02,729
is the most generic implementation which

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:07,629
is currently used by the majority of

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:13,919
which are supporting platforms and

00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:13,919
initially support or maintain there was

00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:30,759
this maintenance was done by others from

00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:34,539
the narrow and work between one

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,930
important thing I can see there is is

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:40,750
the core implementation of our msg from

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:54,779
from the transport layer so that it is

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:54,779
possible to have different transport for

00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:00,659
currently there is giving the SMP which

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,659
are

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:12,830
this is unfortunately by implementation

00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:18,320
mainly for multiple words so we are

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:24,110
going to be state of our MST in in the

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:26,690
next row so let's go there is nothing

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:33,050
which is called Artemis each bus which

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:35,600
is a virtual party to which the RPMs two

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,700
devices are registered so either it is a

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:43,790
birthday or a message advice which is

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:45,440
then if you take sources of little

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:50,300
system driver our message whatever

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:53,150
message about fluency or can be chilling

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,450
which is in the same directory name is

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,090
different or SMD which again is a

00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:09,169
directory but there is this prefix you

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:11,120
come once device is registered it thanks

00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:16,660
to the probing mechanism present in

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:20,750
Linux kernel it's brought in with one of

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:23,720
our key message breakers there are

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,630
several of them one of them is

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:33,729
polarization bar which is quite recent

00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:40,870
and it exports actually we are image G

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:45,050
impacts or its endpoints that refers to

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,380
unity like Heather is menu before there

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,380
was this

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:58,490
the one addresses export it to to user

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,999
space using the correct device and

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,220
appearance legislation partly message

00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:06,759
and then they can write their own

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,069
partnership with Texas is this device

00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:15,170
actually send the data through shared

00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:16,459
memory a secondary port this is one

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,899
thing okay

00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:26,499
one way we can leverage MP another way

00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:31,189
is to protect internally normal so

00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:35,209
welcome has this SNP RPM research with

00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:38,899
Barbara manager which actually takes

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:45,999
care of poor management in the system

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:51,050
and in in the host site in the kernel

00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:55,660
there there is just an API and actually

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:58,370
work when setting people state or

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,040
changing frequencies the trot is done by

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,250
the secondary core and those who matter

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,540
communicated to rpms key to the other

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:15,769
single and last but not least there is

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:23,110
also another our message driver called

00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:23,110
video for Linux and this one is used by

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:37,939
framework and what it does it sends not

00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:40,339
decoded frames or pictures to the other

00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:43,470
core then the secondary core takes care

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:48,010
of the decoding and

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:51,420
Darvin colonel colonel

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:57,760
so the discrete transform computation

00:10:51,420 --> 00:11:02,050
here but it's the other other side so we

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:06,430
have actually here is floating and this

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:11,940
can be can be regarded as our management

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,940
which is a critical part of the system

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:19,230
floating to the other core can be

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,230
regarded as as well

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,540
wait how to love your chart in message

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:30,330
fool

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:33,880
so this is if if i zoom a little bit

00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:42,040
here we have T bar so I take this branch

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:44,800
on and under our paths and message there

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:50,800
is eager Tyga's which is again number

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:54,250
two bus to which retired device is

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,640
registered by module called remote probe

00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,030
and this is what you take care of

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:06,660
loading the humor for for in secondary

00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:10,900
core and once the primer is loaded it

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:14,260
parses one portion of the pearlberg work

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,540
and in this this portion there is a

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,710
thing called resource people in which

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:23,470
there are entries for for travel devices

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:28,120
once it finds his entry it registers a

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:31,660
device which then get roped with virtue

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,720
our key message this were child rival

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:37,949
provided by a pure time

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:50,850
message let's see what you and then this

00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:56,300
gets so another way to create your tell

00:12:50,850 --> 00:13:00,449
device driver which is not the most

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,509
beautiful like doing things but there is

00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:06,480
a problem and because of the problem

00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:08,670
this is the reason why it's also done

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,980
like this the problem is if you want

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,230
your course to start completely

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,060
independently which means you don't want

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:21,000
your lineage to start your secondary

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:24,360
core but you want an early by system to

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,579
record for example you enable some

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:36,509
device and you you you need you need a

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:48,240
very positive response which is small as

00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:50,160
possible every game before and what it

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,740
puts very clouds take care of the

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:58,470
critical parts of the system and then

00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:03,000
you put Linux kernel kernel starts

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,870
slowly and you're already taking care of

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,300
everything

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:13,459
during the Linux kernel startup this

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:15,480
driver registers directly already

00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:18,210
existing where travel device which is

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,730
already up so it's not taking

00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,890
the firmware file and different from her

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,260
file a sexually not many - by trade and

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:29,430
only in this case so this is another

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:33,000
another use case and now we get to the

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:38,670
point where I will try to explain a

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:44,540
little bit how vertical works so death

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:49,200
and with regard to our key message so

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:51,180
vertigo is quite complicated but I will

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,070
explain how probably works and how we

00:14:51,180 --> 00:15:10,110
use it with our message is anybody here

00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:15,839
familiar with your tie oh just so it's

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:22,860
simple vertical and thinks I think

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:26,610
altered you and and each word to compose

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,750
of two living buffers and the magic here

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,100
is that each of the ring buffers is

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:37,440
singular reader the single write your

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:40,980
ring buffer so in the beginning this

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,870
ring buffer let's say it's full of three

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:50,910
per person and like to point out this is

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:54,800
that those three bumpers are actually

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,930
used only to sort pointer to the actual

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,709
container predicta so there is a pool of

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:04,110
buffers and then there are those to

00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:09,079
remembers with any just add resistance

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:14,310
pointers to to those members of the

00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:16,560
buffer so one one site wants to send a

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,890
message it reads the four bytes of this

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,360
will confirm to make things simple which

00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:26,790
we can call a location then the payloads

00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:31,020
yeah of course the Artemis head race is

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:33,510
written into the buffer and after that

00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,900
the fellow is returning to the

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:39,810
conference and then the address of of

00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:44,910
this buffer is written in to be avail in

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:46,680
summary the reception site reads those

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:51,230
four bytes who were reached out of the

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:55,500
ring buffer and if it's now the address

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:57,800
of the buffer which was sent but I can

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,460
adjust the points off to the other side

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:06,270
and then they can do whatever is needed

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:08,910
by this with the buffer and once the

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:12,960
other train is done with that it writes

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:17,990
back the pointer to be used ring buffer

00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,990
you can call this the allocation country

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,360
quite interesting way on occasion

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,700
because you don't need any interquartile

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:32,430
working during the communication and

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:35,130
because it's not just during comfort the

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,880
spring buffers in this case it would not

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:41,040
be a mission to user in buffer because

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,990
you would need to do a copy into the

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,570
ring buffer in order to send the data

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:51,260
and then you need to read out the data

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,260
very very positive if you not want any

00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:59,880
any working so this way it's very very

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,440
impatient that's why your trial is only

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,440
useful for

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,480
communication and one important thing

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,480
that allows for therapy

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:23,120
yeah actually I will show the procedure

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,429
here there is a an interrupt but this is

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,590
not this is not mandatory and also work

00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:32,559
you don't interrupt if the other court

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:36,860
just post but which might look like

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:40,669
approach because similar in power but

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:43,100
with summer pictures can be can be the

00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:47,409
way to go for example there Americans

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,409
programmable respondent makes from TI

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,530
usage of Interop system its attack so

00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:03,169
again I will just pass go through the

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:05,600
process so let's say Linux like to send

00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:08,510
something to be remote power so it reads

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,510
I would love to use in buffer it writes

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:15,049
the header and payload that the data

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,760
packets and killed in 3m a ring buffer

00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:20,720
which is another in buffer this is some

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:25,789
fine premise and then I trigger of this

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:28,280
trigger and the before it's not this

00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:31,190
like between the address from the

00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:37,850
available buffer and it passed it to

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:40,669
something some code by and then there

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,460
might be some harpist Huber or your

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:51,049
friends to pointer to the perforation is

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:55,429
put and then I can become interesting

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:59,539
thing is that the buffers can be free

00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:02,270
later out of order and this also would

00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:04,640
be complicated well with simpler

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,580
evaporate not be possible to even do

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,780
zero copy here it is possible to do zero

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:14,870
copy and and the allocation free debug

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:16,429
offer once they are processed in out of

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,519
order neither

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:21,919
and when when the free happens again the

00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,869
result there is a trigger animator up

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,559
with the other side so that the other

00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:31,820
side note that for example if this fool

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:34,279
is defeated master would wait for an

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:44,149
interrupt and once an offer is free and

00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:47,119
it would be triggered from the other

00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:52,249
side it is completely the same

00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:55,879
just another if you compare pictures

00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:59,779
just just the color change and then the

00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,409
sense of the arrows it is not done in

00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:05,720
the same way

00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:08,960
just another pair of ring buffers it is

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:14,659
used so in total there are four ring

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:20,139
buffer synthesis important now for a

00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:24,379
strike so as I said it's a very cool

00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:27,200
library which is it is constituted by

00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:31,009
those for how to see there are some

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,919
headers those are very important so

00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:39,340
there is this artistic life artistic you

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:42,740
and mr. name service strikes provides

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:45,110
santa chiara api for creation new

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,350
endpoint registration of human point

00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:52,249
cetera at mystic you which is not

00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:55,669
mandatory and we disabled it is

00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:59,029
introducing provides walking receipt

00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:00,830
which is might useful if you use you

00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:03,980
don't use articles you can just use an

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:07,100
interrupt oh my god that's it there you

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:10,850
don't see it there is what to magic

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:15,620
actually happens it's the it's a very

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:18,289
lightweight implementation of of

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,559
as I described it and then there are

00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:24,529
those two two layers one layer for poor

00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:27,169
patient to the Arco so basically there

00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:31,070
is just a very thin amount of new tech

00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:34,850
some up for a few very thick and then

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:41,629
this form layer which is used for for

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:55,549
patient different platforms so there are

00:22:41,629 --> 00:23:00,860
interrupts and this service this is used

00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:04,419
for announcement of of services to the

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:08,840
other side because when the system

00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:11,299
doesn't know or may not know but was

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,980
very slowly became equal to the empty

00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:26,119
core make sense message to fix and when

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:29,769
address and address is looking for which

00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:32,360
is formatted in certain way where name

00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:36,679
the compatible strain gauges on there

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,399
and the address of the Munich creative

00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:42,919
endpoints on the inside so that

00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:48,169
dynamically driver's name is Colonel can

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:51,980
pro like new artistic device dynamically

00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:55,490
created in this way so any correctly

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:58,759
announces its people very cool but this

00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:05,169
process of mandatory again

00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:08,299
the way all of us as I said it's

00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:11,419
thankful player simple and it's BS

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:13,399
license to use it

00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:17,469
there is a three artists port bare metal

00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:21,049
ore and zipper pull is in progress and

00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:29,239
if you like to look at the politics it's

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:32,199
supposed to give up and now let me pass

00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:48,079
the graph to my will present you

00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:50,329
something - yeah you mean here with the

00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:55,190
name service

00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:58,849
well Linux needs to know to what address

00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:01,249
descent or we moved community because

00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:03,949
one thing is you would send some some

00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:14,929
perfect but when we doesn't know that

00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:17,839
the merit that provides some no no we're

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:21,139
sending messages are what is the purpose

00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:25,699
of the property so either something is

00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:29,709
there are some entry device treat or it

00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:29,709
can be done this way by directly

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,210
there is no

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,390
[Music]

00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:58,720
yes yes it's like will be P there are

00:25:47,500 --> 00:26:00,880
not connected there's sorry yes yes on

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:07,540
both sides it's like like PDP you just

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:11,110
it's a fire-and-forget you don't know

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:14,590
what happens but well it isn't in the

00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:16,210
same a sociis mood like they do not be

00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,410
drops or anything but it depends on

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,410
implementation it happens

00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,579
[Music]

00:27:03,340 --> 00:28:02,890
so which can be written generated in

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:08,620
here are that say like to transport

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:08,620
sight realize

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:25,250
if there is expected in the values again

00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:27,040
Sunni allies say to clear this in your

00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:40,580
eyes

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:46,060
application okay so you see when there

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:52,780
are existing solutions already you could

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:58,760
see some presentations already here so

00:28:52,780 --> 00:29:02,260
many of these are DC modern solutions

00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,900
are based for distribution

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,970
high-performance distributed systems

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:11,860
communicating about the network we are

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:11,860
focusing on tightly coupled systems

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:30,830
using c program language which small

00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:33,800
size for resistors for multi-core we are

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:36,550
supporting our key message was presented

00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,550
by mark

00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:48,780
registers to communicate between us so

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:55,890
what's our main requirement as I said

00:29:48,780 --> 00:30:03,000
it's small contacts our PC very don't

00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:06,150
mind my program like we should so really

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:16,590
we are supporting C to follow our

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:19,800
people's future there could be others we

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:27,000
are not forcing users to use particular

00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:41,270
API stop stop Dante is generally it can

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:41,270
be modular and simple open source

00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:54,200
so how to use ER kissing applications I

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:59,600
can explain example let's say we have a

00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,720
device on one corner we have Linux which

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:10,190
is using for

00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:13,940
it server or play media application and

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:19,280
you have radio transceiver and he won't

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:22,730
use it for quickly communication 3 so

00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:27,590
you can have another power which will

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:29,510
committed to this radio transfer and do

00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:34,490
you want to communicate between this

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:40,100
link score and this second car so you

00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:48,610
can use a erm you see and what you need

00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:51,620
to do as I said stop is generally so

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:55,430
your interface you want to and uniquely

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:57,970
 it in idea or file which is

00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:00,920
using interface definition language

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:05,870
which we designed to be similar to speak

00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:10,790
but obviously you need to provide some

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:15,260
more information to let us know how the

00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:19,000
data be sterilized because it's not

00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:24,560
always obvious from function declaration

00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,950
so means definition and here is

00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,950
generated

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:36,289
of course work but

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:41,350
this is what the real user it called in

00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:45,710
this application so you can compare it

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:47,690
against similar so when you have this

00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:52,520
ideal file and you will generate your

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:54,919
stop code and then it's everything you

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,159
need to you need to create your

00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:01,730
application so what you need to do them

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,539
in plain sight you need to initialize

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:15,860
the RPC and then gimmick for your RTC

00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:19,059
functions on the server you also need to

00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:37,460
initialize our PC and then register

00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:42,830
services services 100 just one RPC call

00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:47,770
and I use your amateur code so you can

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,770
use the thread for execution

00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:58,000
other musical or you think you want to

00:33:51,260 --> 00:34:05,780
just RPC calls when you are done just

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:08,480
IPC so it's everything for me if you

00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:16,730
have any questions for me or Mike you

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:19,669
can ask here we have projects contact

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,369
any question you can send us email you

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:24,530
can contribute each video will be will

00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:27,099
be interesting and there's the police

00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,099
project

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:31,259
[Music]

00:34:51,349 --> 00:35:00,920
so in this case if you put a pointer to

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:03,150
data theta will be disabled as another

00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:10,440
pointer to the other side but through

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:12,960
rule data don't you could be done or we

00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,000
are mainly focusing on moving or moon

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,550
occasionally there is a possibility tea

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,380
party supporters but of course when you

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,380
negate over Safari this is not possible

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,989
[Applause]

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:38,340
yeah this is a problem which is to be

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:39,930
involved in our message as well so here

00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,570
we see depends on our key messaging

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:45,350
public or vacation so but those are

00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,350
physical addresses

00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,179
[Music]

00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:01,660
you can add your own data types and

00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:04,449
repeat in function declared we declare

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:13,930
and these questions will be also this

00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:16,329
area lies well obviously our disease

00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:25,949
going through structure and so on is the

00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:37,329
exact size you are supporting input also

00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:43,049
very pertinent questions I wanted just

00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:51,339
the previous question correctly for the

00:36:43,049 --> 00:37:08,650
annotation edition share everything the

00:36:51,339 --> 00:37:14,759
exact address the size of the data for

00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:18,939
example esta course but you can text

00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:22,359
back and forth which is quite

00:37:18,939 --> 00:37:25,079
interesting because then well the aim of

00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:28,089
the game is to take from some steak and

00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,739
really provide to particular soccer API

00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:32,400
to the other side and let the ball

00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:32,400
spectrum

00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:39,210
for example and when you do this

00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:42,329
sometimes by the design of the staggered

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:50,329
library you would need nested calls back

00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:50,329
and forth so we all support it yes

00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:05,039
sorry yeah if one girl projects will put

00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:11,700
with how do we handle it it's a good

00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:18,839
question in again this is something

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:20,849
which is not yet well in for an extra

00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,180
course we have something called boutique

00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:26,539
or manager where we take care but this

00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,710
is mainly used for particular

00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:33,599
microcontrollers in case of linux

00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:39,210
terrorism like microcontroller Linux

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:43,230
port this is very hard it is to be

00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:50,490
solved there are regular meetings or

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:53,339
calls of by OpenMP Thursday our time

00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:55,890
from night 9:00 p.m. so if you have any

00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:59,039
if you're interested we have missile

00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:02,609
project or in each neuron go and join

00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:07,140
those boss if you send me an email I can

00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:14,839
send invitation but there are things to

00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:14,839
do but of course later

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,930
it's it's quite platform dependent that

00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,930
this is problem

00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:46,240
[Music]

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:49,510
if it sends fairness messages well well

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,510
the daytime there is no checksum imposed

00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:55,859
by a message about the penalty time if

00:39:52,510 --> 00:40:01,650
the patient can do some checks on needed

00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:06,960
yeah because well the aim is to make

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:11,559
generically the problem with with

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:17,049
removed or reset super specific this as

00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:27,880
well so there's you are getting to be

00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:36,430
remote control yeah it is relying on

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:43,390
retinol so technically when one when the

00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:46,240
Turk can be like depression applied yeah

00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,470
from beginning what we can send some

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,440
ecology if you want

00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:52,119
wait for the technology that depends is

00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,309
accommodation but if you don't use

00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:58,599
anything and you just deplete the tool

00:40:54,309 --> 00:41:01,829
the monster below to reveal just run out

00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:01,829
of the buffers and will have to

00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:14,079
[Music]

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:17,079
yeah yeah

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,079
so

00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:34,599
young it is yeah you have to be open

00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:34,599
again this is one dependent depends yeah

00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,659
[Music]

00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,190
[Music]

00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,909
[Music]

00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:14,270
[Music]

00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:48,069
and also multiple instances and like

00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,309
pores in your system and you need

00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:55,349
multiple independent channels running

00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:55,349
the independent places in memory

00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:02,979
[Music]

00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:18,620
because well I have been talking about

00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:21,530
markets or frames but though we need to

00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,480
consider those are just data written

00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,160
into a shared memory and the shared

00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,900
memory is a that's wrong

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,160
likely inside the system so I don't

00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:37,430
think is going to really have the

00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:39,080
connection ERP see what we are in case

00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,600
in there you see of course there is an

00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,210
acknowledged and there's an upper upper

00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:48,700
layer on top of either our domestic or

00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:48,700
you are in case of you are there is

00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,170
another question or maybe we are running

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,489
[Music]

00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:05,489
so

00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,039
[Music]

00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:39,809
[Music]

00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,479
[Music]

00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,300
