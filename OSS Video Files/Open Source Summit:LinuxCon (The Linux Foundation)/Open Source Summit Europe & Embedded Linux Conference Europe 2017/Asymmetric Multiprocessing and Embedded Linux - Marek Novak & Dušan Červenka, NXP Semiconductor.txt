Description: 
	Asymmetric Multiprocessing and Embedded Linux - Marek Novak & Dušan Červenka, NXP Semiconductor; BUT FEEC Brno

Asymmetric Multiprocessing and Embedded Linux (Marek Novak, NXP Semiconductors) – The Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP) is a perspective method for handling multiple dedicated CPUs in a System on Chip (SoC). Remote Processor Messaging (RPMsg) is a thin layer on top of VirtIO component addressing the communication between different CPU cores. Marek Novak will present current state of art of this component in Linux kernel, the counterpart implementation for cores running RTOS or bare-metal (RPMsg-Lite). He will also present user-space “access” layers for AMP which notably consist of Embedded Remote Procedure Call (eRPC) open-source library.

About Marek Novak
I was born in 1991 in the Czech Republic, where I studied up to age of 15 years. At that time, I left to study in Dijon, France. I am an alumnus of BUT FEEC in Brno, Czech Republic and currently pursue my PhD studies in the field of fiber-less optical communications. I work in parallel for NXP Semiconductor, specifically on RPMsg component and Remoteproc. I am author of the erpc-imx-demos and rpmsg-lite repositories on Github. I speak English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Czech, Russian. (and C)
