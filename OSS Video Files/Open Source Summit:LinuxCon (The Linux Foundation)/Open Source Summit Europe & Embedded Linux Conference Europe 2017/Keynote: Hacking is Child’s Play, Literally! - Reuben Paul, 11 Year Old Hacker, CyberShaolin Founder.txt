Description: 
	Keynote: Hacking is Child’s Play, Literally! - Reuben Paul, 11 Year Old Hacker, CyberShaolin Founder and Cyber Security Ambassador 

IoT is a buzz word but what does that mean? Internet of Things or Internet of Toys or Internet of Threats. In this keynote, 11 year old, Reuben Paul aka The Cyber Ninja would discuss and demonstrate how smart things (or toys) does not necessarily mean secure things. 
He will share his experience, playing with and hacking toys and cover tools (sniffers, packet analyzers, Raspberry Pi, python scripts) that could make connected systems creepy. With demonstration, he will highlight the insecurities in smart technologies and discuss the application of these technologies in the real world (drones, autonomous cars, etc.), and share why it is important to understand these threats that can not only impact things in a game room, but real things that we use daily as well.
Come for a fun-filled, entertaining, and educational talk to find out how the hacking game is not limited just to the game room, and learn about why Hacking is Child’s play, literally!

About Reuben Paul
Reuben is a 11 year old from Pflugerville, TX. When asked by his 1st grade teacher to illustrate his future career, he drew on a sheet that he wanted to become a Cyber Spy. But, Reuben is not just another computer geek. He lives a life on the edge, between his school, as a straight ‘A’ student and all of his other passions. When he is not playing video games or on the computer, he likes to read, and takes classes to play inline hockey, swim, do gymnastics, Shaolin Do KungFu, play piano, drums and do art. Reuben is an invited speaker, delivering awareness talks and keynotes on the importance of teaching CyberSecurity to kids and adults. He has been featured at several industry leading Information Security conferences. His keynote talks on “Creating a Safe and Secure Cyber World for Kids (by a kid)”, “Developing r00t-kidz: The Future of Cybersecurity”, “InfoSec from the mouth of babes (or an 8 year old)”, and "Mutually symb-IoT-ic Security" have been quoted and referenced by several information security sources and news agencies that call him a “Child Hacker". They have become a source of inspiration to kids and adults alike to start teaching CyberSecurity to kids.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,550
so hello open-source summit good morning

00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:11,099
how are you doing today good so I'm

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,690
gonna start my talk and my talk is

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,310
called hacking is child's play literally

00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,470
so I'm gonna start by introducing myself

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,400
then I'm going to talk about how hacking

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,109
is child's play and how the IOT the

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,210
Internet of Things can very easily

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,060
become the internet of threats when not

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,059
secured after that I will do a demo and

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,100
show you how to hack a smart toy car and

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:40,260
then I will end with some closing

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:42,480
thoughts so Who am I my name is Ruben OB

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,300
che I Paul but my friends call me rap

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,980
star my twitter handle is at rap star

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,920
that can use to tweet about this talk

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,420
I'm 11 years old and I attend the

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,789
kelly'll and middle school so all in all

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,870
God has blessed me to speak since I was

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,590
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,899
I've spoken in 14 security conferences

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,640
five of them were international I have

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,799
done 12 keynotes and I have received

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:14,670
five standing ovations and several press

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:16,950
and media legends well the media refers

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,040
to me as a child hacker I'm also known

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,930
for my kung-fu skills when I was seven I

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,520
had the honour of receiving the title of

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,250
being the youngest Shaolin no kung-fu

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,340
black belt in America so you heard Mr

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,049
Semillon say it all began when my

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,909
first-grade teacher asked me what do you

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,549
want to be when you grow up and this is

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,579
what I drew is my future job this is me

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,560
laying back on my couch this is me this

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,750
is my hat going through the cloud this

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,829
is the other computer spiral wall with

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,799
holes in it and this is the other

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:53,610
computer getting pawned

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,530
so I'm also being made into a comic

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,540
which i think is really cool and it's

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,119
called a cyber ninja by the hackers trip

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,770
group and as you can see even tux is

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,149
featured in it so that's really cool and

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:11,270
here is a scene from my comic for you

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,270
mr. Torvalds and it says I love Linux

00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:19,220
so now did the main topic how hacking is

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:21,500
child's play so what is hacking hacking

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,230
is what hackers do but then who is a

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,790
hacker what is the first image that

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:30,200
comes to your mind when you think of a

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,800
hacker is it anonymous mr. robot crash

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,410
and burn their crime was curiosity a

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,500
programmer but how many of you thought

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,480
of your kids in fact by the way this is

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,110
a picture of my little brother super

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,360
cute he is already starting to show

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,810
signs of technology and interest in

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,810
cybersecurity

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,680
here are two quotes that I think really

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,410
capture the essence of who a hacker is

00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,330
the first is the hacker way is an

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,480
approach to building that involves

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,590
continuous improvement and iteration

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,390
hackers believe that something can

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,390
always be better and that nothing is

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:15,560
ever complete can you guess who said

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:17,210
this anyone nobody wants to guess okay

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,900
the founder of Facebook yes

00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:22,970
mr. Mark Zuckerberg the second one is a

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,950
hacker to me is someone creative who

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,250
does wonderful things the person who

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,380
said this is the inventor of the World

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,280
Wide Web

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,750
this is Sir Tim berners-lee so by

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,130
definition childsplay

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,630
is an extremely simple task or act and

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,460
by the security breaches we hear on a

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:50,420
daily basis we can know that this is

00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:52,730
true and so how is hacking child's play

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,890
hacking is child's play because of the

00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,410
changing landscape of technology

00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,110
technology that makes our world

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,210
connected here's a drawing I drew to

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,670
illustrate how connected we are we are

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,270
highly connected within and going to the

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,270
outside world

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:17,180
the IOT the Internet of Things the IOT

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,210
is a now a very big thing and the IOT by

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,240
definition is a connected network of

00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,770
physical devices that use an Internet

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,710
Protocol for communication

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,620
an exchange of information ensure the

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,660
IOT is an internet work of physical

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,910
devices and as you can see in this

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,729
picture from airplanes to automobiles

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,470
smart phones to smart homes spanning

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,500
several different industries including

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,729
retail energy entertainment health care

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,410
transportation and even the military

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,419
speaking of the military I read in

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,889
computer world that autonomous killing

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,620
machines were being developed for

00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,900
military advantage and that same article

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,720
also expressed that a big threat to this

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,479
is hackers so while the era of the

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,849
terminators is not far from reality we

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,250
must also recognize that the possibility

00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:09,830
of a digital world war is in either

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,419
I wonder if World War three will be

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,490
fought with bits and bytes instead of

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:18,590
missile heads and I sincerely hope that

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:21,440
day will never come recently in the past

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,659
May I spoke at the International one

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,180
conference where I keynoted and did a

00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:30,139
demo on how to hack a smart toy teddy

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,810
bear and where I turned it into a remote

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:37,070
spying device and could basically record

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:40,969
secretive conversations I did that later

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:44,259
in August this year with the CIO of the

00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:47,900
DIA and she ICO key noted with her

00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:50,570
showing the same attack and at the

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,580
Department of Defense in intelligence

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:56,419
information systems worldwide confidence

00:05:52,580 --> 00:06:00,580
I certainly I've never done a TED talk

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,580
but I certainly have done a Teddy talk

00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:08,870
so now to get to my demo how hacking is

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:11,419
really child's play so meet rev what I

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,849
have with me are three smart toy cars

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:17,030
yes I can't count I'm only holding up

00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:21,009
two but basically this is how it looks

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,009
and bass I'm going to leave this down

00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:27,110
these smart toy cars the way they work

00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:31,310
is they connect to an app on your phone

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:34,789
and that you can connect to it and you

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,860
can race around or you can fight now for

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,210
time purposes I can't but I would have

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,139
called my little brother up - how

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,460
demonstrate how we can fight but for

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,500
those of you who don't have a cute

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,750
sibling at home to play with there is an

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,669
autonomous feature in these cars where

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,259
one car tracks down and chases the other

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:54,530
car

00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:57,560
so here is how we hacked it and while

00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,720
the AI has a very distinctive advantage

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,150
against the other car so it's extremely

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,680
hard to win against it so you don't have

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,660
to become an expert at playing the game

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,539
or you can do what we did we hacked it

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,580
and here's how we did it we put a

00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,050
sniffer in between the app in the car

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,590
and by the way I drew this picture

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,889
yesterday so we put a sniffer in between

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,000
the app in the car and we basically

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,849
sniffed a bunch of Bluetooth low-energy

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,570
packets and we could we analyzed each

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:28,970
packet to understand what was going on

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,860
here's an example of a packet that we

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,610
saw when the car was connected to the

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,370
app we basically had to there was a

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,729
series of values that made the car come

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:45,740
online and here's a very important value

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:48,400
so pay attention to that the next thing

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,949
that we did is we used a rogue device a

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,860
Raspberry Pi to become a

00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:57,229
man-in-the-middle so RPI TM Raspberry Pi

00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,690
in the middle and we basically connected

00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:04,130
to the hacker car and finally made that

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,800
we brought that into battle and showed

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:14,000
how that had the advantage I get a

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:19,039
visual ok so what I'm gonna do now is I

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,259
am going to what I have with me is my

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:26,840
phone and I'm basically mirroring it on

00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:29,960
my iPhone on my screen on the right and

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,930
going to go to the rev app and on my

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,200
left I have a Raspberry Pi can you see

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:39,740
that all right ok I have a Raspberry Pi

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,360
terminal and I just ssh into it and on

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,550
the right I will be using that for

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,070
something else but basically right now

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,810
I'm going to take two cars as you can

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,790
remember this the black car is going to

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,770
be in manual mode so I control that and

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,930
the white car will be in a ton of

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:57,020
the manual will turn blue and the white

00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:04,660
will turn green so I'm going to turn

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:04,660
this one on and connect to it

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:36,290
as you see edge has just connected and

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,290
I'm gonna put the other one in a mode

00:09:51,840 --> 00:10:05,460
and now I can drive around and fight as

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,650
you can see in the middle is the red

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,250
health of the enemy and on my side the

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,930
green is getting is my health as you can

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,330
see it slowly will decrease if it shoots

00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,670
me there you go

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,220
it's decreasing that so I'm gonna pause

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:26,070
that and show you how we hacked our

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:30,180
third rev car this gray the gray hacker

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:32,100
car so what I'm going to do first is I'm

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,710
going to scan for Bluetooth low-energy

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:42,540
devices in the network to try and find

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:51,500
my car so I'm just going to do a HCI

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:51,500
tool le scan and that's a lot of devices

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:59,070
so if you're trying to turn off your

00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:03,300
Bluetooth it's too late I think I see a

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,630
Fitbit okay so I'm basically going to

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:10,830
connect using the MAC address and

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:13,080
interactively connect so I successfully

00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,089
just connected to the car and what I'm

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,140
gonna do now is I'm going to scan for

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:21,060
the main services now these first three

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,589
we looked up on bluetooth specs and we

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,120
found that they are specific to the

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,530
manufacturer

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,390
I don't know they actually general

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,450
access a general attribute it's for

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,130
communicating between the car and the

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,820
rest actually specific to the

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:39,060
manufacturer so we'll have to dig deeper

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:42,959
so to dig deeper you can see the

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,760
characteristics which is basically you

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,190
think you can think of properties for

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,790
the services like readwrite notify so

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:53,760
basically I'm going to scan or see those

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,860
and we get a bit more and we can

00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,150
actually go and see the descriptors of

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:03,300
those characteristics and get a lot more

00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:05,769
so when we came online and you heard the

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,050
beep popping when the car can

00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:09,610
it it actually gave a series of values

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,149
and one of the things that was being

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:19,420
checked was this handle 21 so I'm going

00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:22,299
to just read that handle and we get this

00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,769
long string of hex values now what I'm

00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:25,660
going to do is I'm gonna get everything

00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,239
that's not a zero cuz we know that if

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:32,110
it's zero then it means nothing and I am

00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:39,610
going to just copy all that and actually

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:46,619
use Python to decode it we're just doing

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:52,660
byte array dot from hacks that decode

00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:55,799
and we get rev 10 804 so that is the

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,939
same car that we connected to and the

00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:02,679
beginning when we search for the MAC

00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:04,329
address when Rev 1084 so that is it the

00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,569
next thing that I'm going to do is when

00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:09,759
it was connecting up we found a another

00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:13,749
value that was being written to command

00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:16,420
0 X 17 and as you can see now can I get

00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:24,819
a visual as you can see now the hacker

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:27,189
car is the cyan blue color yeah okay hey

00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:30,249
as you can see this car as a cyan blue

00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:36,490
color and I'm going to change it to make

00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:41,049
it a pink color so I successfully just

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:43,420
changed the color and basically 8 4 is

00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:46,089
for color changing in 0 5 is for a

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,040
specific color there's an enumeration

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,299
the next thing that I'm gonna do is I'm

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,879
not just gonna change the color I'm

00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:57,549
gonna drive this car so I'm gonna do 7 8

00:13:51,879 --> 00:14:02,350
1 f00 now this is for actually driving 7

00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:05,769
8 is for driving 1 f is for driving

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:10,029
forward and 0 0 is for the angle so if I

00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:12,309
put that down and drive it nothing

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:14,949
happens this is because the car hasn't

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:17,559
been fully turned online and what we

00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:19,450
have to do is we have to do 9 1 0 1 to

00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,520
bring it online now

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:25,870
I think it's really cool cuz if you hear

00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,700
it it silently comes online and I can

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,280
just run that command again to check and

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,920
as you see we have successfully just

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:38,740
half this car we can now actually drive

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:42,340
backwards and I'm going to drive forward

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:45,220
or just push it up and show you how this

00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,560
would work in battle so I'm going to

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,210
resume the battle and show you how this

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,470
would work now I'm going to run the

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,050
missile command this actually has a

00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:06,280
shoot command where I can shoot it so

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:08,920
I'm going to do nine five oh there you

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:13,390
go I'm going to do nine five zero zero

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:16,980
zero four zero one and I can actually oh

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,980
it is disconnected

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:56,030
one second yeah I'll just move all down

00:15:39,410 --> 00:16:00,250
closer oh so now the white one is in

00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,250
manual mode and the black one will be

00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:12,020
autonomous so going to you and pausing

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:15,560
it there you go

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:20,600
and I am going to go and send the

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:23,780
missile command and after that happens

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,660
I'm going to enter and as you can see we

00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,830
just successfully shot the other cars

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,560
and one thing that I want to show you is

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:33,440
I'm going to turn off the autonomous car

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:36,110
and just had the manual lined up against

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,320
this and if we try and shoot this car

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,690
the manual against the hacker car it

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,240
won't work

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,980
so the autonomy or the hacker car kind

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,200
of has an invisible force field because

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,970
not all the parent parameters have been

00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:55,760
set to have been set and fully brought

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,250
it online so what I can do now is I can

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:03,110
actually shoot change color and drive

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:05,209
without being able to get shot so what

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,810
one of the things that I could do is I

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:11,150
could change this to make it the same

00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:17,360
color as that to make it I don't know if

00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:20,260
you can see that but it is both no wait

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,260
it's both now blue

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,539
it is both now blue so it looks like an

00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:31,750
ally I can also change it to make it

00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:33,820
look like it is fully turned off but it

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:39,940
is still it can still drive forward and

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:41,830
shoot and basically I can also send a

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,419
silent missile command so it's full on

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:53,580
stealth and you don't hear it just you

00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:55,720
hear the manual car receiving it and

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,159
basically now I would write a Python

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:05,760
script to just keep running this over

00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:05,760
and over again but now it is game over

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:21,060
back to my presentation so that's the

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:27,380
live demonstration and

00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,380
[Applause]

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:38,940
meet Rev robotic exploited vehicles so

00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:40,769
now I'm closing remember I told you I

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,289
was known for my cybersecurity skills

00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:45,570
and my kung-fu skills there's a reason I

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,470
said that when kids all over the world

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,700
started to write to me and asked me I

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,539
with the help of my parents I created

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,519
cyber Shaolin a nonprofit organization

00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:58,470
that strives to educate equip and

00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:00,360
empower kids and adults with the

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,830
knowledge of cybersecurity dangers and

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:07,559
defenses I create short educate little

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,760
educated simplified videos for kids team

00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,919
make it easier to understand

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,840
cybersecurity and I'm planning to make

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,789
more technically advanced videos as I

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,789
get break for my 6th grade homework and

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,720
but basically we need your help we need

00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:24,360
you to get involved volunteer and/or

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,130
donate so if you can please talk to me

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:30,240
after this conference or after this talk

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:31,889
if you want if you want to help so now

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,539
let's get real and personal well you may

00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:35,970
have thought that that's just hacking a

00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,559
toy this is something insignificant it

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,330
really is it because these same

00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,090
technologies are going into real-world

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,820
applications such as industrial control

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,690
systems autonomous vehicles account

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:52,230
drones Androids so it's very important

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:54,059
and if we don't secure it now then your

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,769
kids your sons your daughters your

00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,010
nephews and your nieces will grow up

00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:02,309
with this insecure infrastructure of

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:04,710
infrastructure of security in closing

00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:06,779
let the IOT not become the internet of

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,440
threats and hacking should not be

00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:12,809
child's play literally so thank you and

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,000
my contact information is Ruben at cyber

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:16,980
Shaolin org I want to thank my God Jesus

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,659
Christ but the gifts he has given me

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,159
he has blessed me to be here and without

00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:25,529
him I would be nowhere here in Proverbs

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,299
622 it says train up a child in the way

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,370
should go and when he is old he will not

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:32,399
depart from it I want to thank Miss

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:34,710
Angela Brown mr. Jim's of Semillon I

00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:36,929
want to thank miss jillian hall and miss

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,799
Cara foil for oil

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:41,250
Foley and you have just heard about how

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,840
can your

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:51,720
child's play literally which it should

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:53,070
not be and thank you all right hold on

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,810
stay up here for a second I want to talk

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,340
to you okay that's this is why I didn't

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,440
do a keynote this morning because I

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,310
didn't want to be shown up by this

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,200
amazing speaker here you know Reuben

00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,480
first of all that was really amazing I

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,250
mean imagine if those were real cars on

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,320
a real road I think that that is your

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,980
point but I want to make a deal with you

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,960
so a couple years ago Lena Stovall's and

00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,620
I were talking on stage about cyber

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,030
security and about a program that we

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,220
have at the Linux Foundation called our

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:28,260
core infrastructure initiative where

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,150
we're trying to work with open source

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,600
projects to create a culture of secure

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:36,810
coding right so less of that shoddy code

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,690
that you mentioned and one of the things

00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:44,100
that Lena said was sometimes when you're

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:46,740
a developer it's hard to think like a

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,640
hacker somebody who's outside trying to

00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,410
get in and we would love to have you

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,900
work you know not only with leanness but
