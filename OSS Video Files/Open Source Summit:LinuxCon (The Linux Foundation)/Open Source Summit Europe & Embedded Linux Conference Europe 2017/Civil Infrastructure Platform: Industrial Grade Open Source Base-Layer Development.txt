Description: 
	Civil Infrastructure Platform: Industrial Grade Open Source Base-Layer Development - Yoshitake Kobayashi & Urs Gleim, Civil Infrastructure Platform

The Civil Infrastructure Platform (CIP) is creating a super long-term supported (SLTS) open source "base layer" for industrial grade software. The base-layer consists of SLTS kernel, basic set of open source software and standardization concepts. Since we launched in April 2016, we spent a lot of effort to realize CIP base-layer.

In this talk, we describe the current status of CIP project. First, we describe “Why CIP?” which includes project strategy, use cases, roadmap and policies. Then, we talk about technical details for each development activities for CIP base-layer. Current development activities includes not just SLTS kernel but real-time, development tools, testing and more. CIP works with related upstream projects for these activities. And finally, we discuss the future roadmap and milestones.
