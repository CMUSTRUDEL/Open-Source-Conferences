	Keynote: Apache Kafka and the Rise of the Streaming Platform - Neha Narkhede, Co-Founder & CTO, Confluent 

Streaming platforms are emerging as a new trend. However, what exactly is a streaming platform? With Apache Kafka at the core, it’s an entirely new perspective on managing the flow of data. Part messaging system, part Hadoop made fast, part fast ETL and scalable data integration, a streaming platform is a new way to stream, store and process data across the business. In this keynote, Neha will share examples of Kafka in action and why Kafka is becoming a central nervous system that ties together the modern, digital business.
