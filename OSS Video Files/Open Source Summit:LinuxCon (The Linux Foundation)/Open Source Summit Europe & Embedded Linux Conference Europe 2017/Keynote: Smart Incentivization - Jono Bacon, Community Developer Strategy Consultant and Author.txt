that was amazing room just what an

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,340
inspiration to so many so many people

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,199
not just in this room but outside of

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,199
this room as well how's everyone doing

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
come on how's everyone doing that's more

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,150
like it

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,420
all right so it's just wonderful to be

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,550
here at the the open source summit so

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,809
many friends so many so many members of

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,370
the open source family and so many new

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,610
faces as well I'm particularly excited

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,989
as as Jim mentioned that we're going to

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,399
be this week running the open community

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,100
button the open community conference

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,600
which is which is a conference that I've

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,770
been working in conjunction with my

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,770
friends of the the Linux Foundation

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,449
around which is designed to provide best

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,219
practice and guidance for how we can

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,160
build powerful and engaging communities

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,690
we did this last month at the open

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,140
source summit in LA and it was a great

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,670
success

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm really proud to bring it here and I

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,939
want to say a big thank you to all of

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,560
you submitted papers and also to those

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,850
of you submitted papers that that didn't

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,850
get in we had a huge number of

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,010
submissions so I work as a community

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,080
strategy consultant and I work with a

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,360
bunch of companies across all kinds of

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,159
different sectors around how to build

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,080
communities either externally around a

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,030
product or a service or cut our

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,560
communities inside of a company that are

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,080
designed to optimize how we work

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,210
together and reduce silos one of the

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,490
questions that I get repeatedly is how

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,540
do I motivate people into action like

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,610
how do I get people to do the things

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,079
that I want them to do and this is not

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,570
really a question that just pertains

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,150
specifically to communities this also

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,270
applies to how we build businesses and

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,920
how we encourage our employees to kind

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,590
of work together and work efficiently as

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,790
well as well as to our you know as well

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,310
as in our families as well this is my

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,430
son Jack who was not hacking cars right

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,990
now but how do we encourage our kids and

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,189
our nieces and nephews and everybody

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,619
else to kind of work together in

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,210
interesting and effective ways so today

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,460
I want to talk about incentives the

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,840
psychology behind why we do things and

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,280
how we're incentivized and then a

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,530
framework that you can think about how

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,390
to apply this now it all starts like

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,070
many things with one of these a brain

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,800
most of us have got one of these in our

00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:20,440
heads and the brain is basically divided

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,470
into two approximate areas one side is

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,090
the conscious intentional thought right

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,040
so we interpret the world around us and

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,870
we make decisions based upon that

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,110
stimulus but the other part of the brain

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,840
is completely subconscious it's almost

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,030
on autopilot and it influences so many

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,680
of our behaviors what's interesting is

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,210
that we are irrational with this side of

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,590
the brain we make irrational choices

00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,330
we're very consistent in those

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,790
rationalities in how we make those

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,590
decisions so that gives us a bit of a

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,150
framework a scaffold in which we can

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,980
think about how we design communities

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,320
and how people fit together and I want

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,810
to share four key principles here four

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,820
elements that really kind of go into why

00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,650
we make the decisions that we do and how

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,170
it can harness those for how we how we

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,180
build incentives the first one is that

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,790
fundamentally we all strive for

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,230
acceptance in some kind of capacity so

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,000
when you build a community this is the

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,910
one of the ability developer summits

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,470
that we ran in Florida when you join a

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,180
community or when you're in a company or

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,590
when you're part of your family you want

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,730
to be accepted but ultimately you want

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,440
to get to a stage where you feel a sense

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,489
of belonging because when you feel a

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,680
sense of longing when you when you're

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,750
part of something you stick around there

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,420
for a long period of time and what this

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,850
tells me is that because we strive for

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,230
that acceptance when we design that set

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,000
of incentives it has to be a

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,220
consistently connected set of incentives

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,260
that keep people around for a longer

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,390
period of time and then ultimately what

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,830
you get the the byproduct of that is

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,450
that sense of acceptance that sense of

00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,760
belonging the other thing that's

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,610
interesting here is that status plays a

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,530
critical role here as humans state as

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,269
much as many of us will want to deny

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,640
this is important to us it's one of the

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,620
reasons why airline mileage programs

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,840
work it's one of the reasons why people

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,730
care about their job titles and moving

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,320
up in their careers is that we want to

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,390
be recognized for the things that we

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,280
contribute the critical thing here is

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,350
that while building status into

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,700
communities and companies is fine it has

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,860
to be built on a platform of equality

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,900
but we don't reward people because of

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,880
their skin color or because of their

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,830
sexuality or because of their gender or

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,840
any other differentiator we don't reward

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:21,489
or deny people what we do is we build an

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,169
environmental everybody can succeed and

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:26,569
accomplish that status equally so

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,370
the second piece here is that we're a

00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,439
fundamentally reciprocal species like if

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,330
I do something for you you're gonna feel

00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,770
like you you need to do something back

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,879
for me as well good example of this is

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:40,759
gifting so for example if I if I gave

00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:42,740
Reuben a present he would feel a natural

00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,439
kind of inclination to kind of repay the

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,659
favor in some kind of way and if while

00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,889
Reubens on his world travels and

00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:51,020
speaking at conferences

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,310
he met a company and he referred them to

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,659
me and said hey you know you should talk

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,229
to this guy he can help you build a

00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,690
community

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:58,129
I'd feel a reciprocal inclination to

00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,580
kind of repay the favor back to Reuben

00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:01,520
as well

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,800
so reciprocation is at the heart of how

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,569
we build incentives as well is that you

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,789
design something where if you do this

00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:09,289
then this will happen and that's another

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:13,639
powerful force that we need to harness

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:14,810
the third is that we form habits and the

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,610
way in which we form those habits is

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:25,340
with repetition so in 2008 I moved to

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,900
California and spoiler alert I didn't

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,009
really care that much about health or

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,930
exercise or eating well right I was a

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:35,000
pretty unfortunate human being in the

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,969
sense that I was lazy in terms of eating

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,339
in terms of exercise my wife who many of

00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:43,550
you in this room know is the opposite of

00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:46,550
that like she eats kale like I've never

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,259
seen anybody eat kale in enlarge in

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,029
large quantities so she got me into this

00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,110
habit of well maybe you should go out

00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,520
and exercise a little bit more so I

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,099
started exercising so I going running

00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,569
swimming cycling and then as I did that

00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,740
I started doing it more and I had to

00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,539
think about it had to really

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,370
intentionally go out and exercise and

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,159
then did a little bit more and before

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,440
you knew it exercise was just something

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:08,240
that you know I thought of well what am

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,250
I gonna exercise today you know it just

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,139
became part of the habit and it's

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,099
because we do it over and over again so

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,930
then you don't have to think about it

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,849
becomes habitual the general thinking

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,800
here is that takes around 66 days to

00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:20,960
develop a habit so what that teaches us

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,759
as well is if somebody joins our

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,279
community or joins our company though

00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,620
that first sixty six days is critical we

00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,849
have to design an incentive path that

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,009
keeps people motivated and moving

00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,659
forward until participation and

00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,860
collaboration is part of the norm this

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,870
is something I experience a lot with my

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,430
clients particularly for companies who

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,900
are kind of working in a slightly

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,160
all the fashion they want to kind of

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,960
bring open-sourcing to their companies

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,490
is getting into the habit of things like

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,240
peer peer review around code and

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,120
collaboration participate in an open

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,370
communication channels the fourth is

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,140
that most of us I'm going to sensors

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,690
we've got some children in the room most

00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,780
of us have a bit of a BS radar okay is

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,640
that when we look at the world we we

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,020
want we want to be treated in authentic

00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,370
ways this is one of the reasons why you

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,050
should never thank anybody with a

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,700
computer when you get one of those

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,060
automated emails thanking you for

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,890
something

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,690
we just discount it doesn't really mean

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,310
anything but if you get if you get a

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,710
thank-you from it from a human being

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,210
from an individual it means a lot so as

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,470
we do this we have to design these

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,410
incentives in a way that is authentic

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,580
that is personal that is human because

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,290
that's what's going to keep us moving

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,820
forward we can't compromise that the

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,950
minute we compromise this the whole

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,600
thing falls apart so these four

00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,040
principles and this is just four there

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,740
are many of these principles in how we

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,630
in how we design communities again act

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,000
as that framework but it also acts as a

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,970
as a lens in which we can look at how we

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,290
build these kinds of communities as well

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,030
now the question is okay so we've got

00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,010
this sense of what we should focus on

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,510
like how do we do it like how do we

00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,410
actually incentivize people how do we

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,260
design these things that get people

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,460
participating to me the way in which we

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,400
do this is the first thing we need to do

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,590
is to understand kind of the the anatomy

00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,810
of an incentive okay so what goes behind

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,630
it and I think of an incentive as having

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,660
three core components the hook the

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,040
reason and the reward okay so as I go

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,480
through this think about this within the

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,490
context not just if you're running a

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,100
community but also again your

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,390
organization's your local communities in

00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,220
your in your local area whatever it

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:22,220
might be or even how you apply this to

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:24,650
your kids the hook is is is essentially

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,650
what is what triggers the incentive and

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,540
this is all about measuring effectively

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:33,200
how people participate in different ways

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,820
okay so the way I tend to think of

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,500
incentives is that people participate in

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,910
a community or in a company and then

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,550
based upon what they do it triggers a

00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,080
series of different incentives and so if

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,250
you continue working if you continue

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,260
doing good and interesting work

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,490
essentially you get new incentives that

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,020
keep you moving forward it's kind of

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,420
like a video game that as you go through

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,170
a video game more and more and newer

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,670
challenges

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,320
presented to you and it keeps your

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,930
interest it captures your interest until

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,639
you build that habit now for us to do

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,889
this well we have to measure a

00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,959
contribution we have to understand what

00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:05,060
a contribution is and how we track that

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,339
now most people when they do this they

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,529
tend to track the action the thing that

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,490
you did okay so I said earlier on that

00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,350
what we want to build here is

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,360
significant and sustained contributions

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,339
okay and when you track actions you

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,779
track the sustained contributions people

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,269
doing things for a long for a for a

00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:22,970
longer period of time the problem with

00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:24,800
this is that while you can track people

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:28,339
posting to a forum or submitting pull

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,160
requests or translating strings or you

00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,209
know running events or speaking events

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,800
you may get people to do a lot of that

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,660
work but it's not very good so what we

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,519
should also track is the validation for

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,250
action as an example when you submit a

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,050
pull request that's an action but if

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,970
that pull request gets it gets code

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,760
reviewed and merged into the master

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,019
branch then that's a validated action is

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,820
that we know that it was good and

00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:51,110
therefore we can count on that as being

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,420
a good contribution to the community

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,190
it's critical that we track both of

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,959
these things and a significant number of

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,970
the metrics kind of tracking platforms

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,980
only track the first one and we have to

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,990
focus on the second one as well as an

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,640
example one of my previous clients is a

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,500
company called hacker one I was actually

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,990
just chatting to Ruben's family about

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,839
this and what's interesting about this

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,510
is there's a public point system that

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,850
they use here and they track reputation

00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,110
and signal so reputation essentially

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,699
hacker one is a platform where you can

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,630
submit vulnerability reports around

00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:25,160
popular products and services so you

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,440
know someone might hack Starbucks and

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,269
they submit a report if that report is

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,949
valid they get seven points if it's

00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:32,060
complete garbage then they get minus

00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:34,550
seven points and there's a graduation

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,930
between the two so the reputation tracks

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,490
the total number of points but the

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,319
signal tracks the average number of

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,620
points for typical reports it gives us a

00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:44,180
real good definite urbe tween high

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,860
contribution and the quality of that

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,389
contribution and there's loads of ways

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,579
in which we can do this co-contribution

00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:51,380
review event organization translations

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,269
governance these are the kind of things

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,949
that we should be thinking about now

00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:56,750
let's talk about the reason so the

00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,860
reason is essentially why would someone

00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,329
do something what are we asking them to

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,040
do and we need to pick things that

00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:03,260
influence and encourage positive

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,100
behavioral patterns and contributions we

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,460
want to design incentives that

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,530
the right kind of behavior and I tend to

00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,100
think of two ways of presenting these I

00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,750
call them submarine and stated

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,610
incentives now a submarine incentive is

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,030
basically a random act of goodwill

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,560
that's completely programmed okay so as

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,270
an example if you're tracking some of

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,460
the work that somebody's doing and you

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,780
want to incentivize them in some way one

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,880
thing you could do is a simple thing to

00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,850
send him a t-shirt now I would do that

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,440
when they've participated 7 to 10 times

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,430
they've been around long enough where

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,260
they're doing some interesting work

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,690
whether on that verge of like do I

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,490
continue okay it's kind of like getting

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,510
two weeks into a new diet at that point

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,660
you're really thinking about the the

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,760
cheeseburger at that point so submarine

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,750
incentives if we design all of it if we

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,460
design a bunch of these submarine

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,470
incentives we pre program them in but

00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,900
they come from humans so we notify a

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:58,320
human of this particular incentive what

00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:00,780
we get then is that kind of roadmap and

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,980
it builds that habit now stated

00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,380
incentives are a little different these

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,330
are very much stated if you do this

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,800
thing then we will do this thing for you

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,000
a good example of this is if you go to a

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,790
coffee shop and they give you a little

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,020
card and you stamp you know a little

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,160
coffee cup each time you buy a coffee

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,770
and then when you get to ten you get a

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,360
free coffee there's no ambiguity around

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,460
that if you get two if you buy tank

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,680
offers you get a free one okay and

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,480
that's good we also see things around

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,770
you know campaigns and competitions if

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,950
you do this thing then you could win

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,210
this prize both are important and and

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,160
both are different ways in which we can

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,990
win which we can deliver this now some

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,060
of you may be thinking okay that's good

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,950
but how do I choose the incentives that

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,480
I want to focus on it's difficult for me

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,340
to provide some general guidance here

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,620
because it has to be specific to your

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,970
community or to your organization for it

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,890
to be authentic like I said people have

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,390
got a BS radar so we need to pick things

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,700
that are very much attuned to that

00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,340
particular area not just throwing out

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,170
swag at people however the way I tend to

00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,210
think of this is as you're choosing them

00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,820
think about the value that you want to

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,710
bring in that incentive not just from

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,330
the community or from the organization's

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:06,090
perspective but also from the individual

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,620
if you can pick an incentive where the

00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,630
individual feels a sense of personal

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,940
growth and benefit but then the

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,470
organization also feels a sense of

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,910
personal growth and benefit then you've

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,090
got a good incentive on your hands and

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,960
then the final thing here is the reward

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,150
like

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,920
rewards them so we've measured something

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,780
it's triggered an incentive what they've

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,570
done is they've done that the goal of

00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,490
that incentive successfully now we need

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,440
to reward them in some way there's two

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,780
types of rewards in the world intrinsic

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,550
and extrinsic and we tend to think

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,190
mostly in a lot of the communities that

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,170
I work with around the extrinsic swag

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,330
physical things physical items you can

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,790
sent people obviously this is expensive

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,990
you have a limited set of funds that you

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,000
can spend on this kind of stuff

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,530
shipping anyone who's run a crowdfunding

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,970
campaign will know that shipping is an

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,690
absolute freaking nightmare

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:56,220
okay so shipping is difficult sir locks

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,080
off certain regions of the world cuz

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,810
it's very difficult to ship to them so

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,640
there's benefits to this but to me the

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,950
real value who are the intrinsic rewards

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,540
this is essentially rewarding someone

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,970
with your approval with your validation

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,040
and it gets to that acceptance pattern

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,290
that I mentioned earlier on just a

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,990
single thank-you email from the CEO of a

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,920
company or the founder of a project

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,450
highlighting someone in a blog post or

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,300
social media sending them an invitation

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,500
to something an executive like inviting

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,480
people to an executive call with the

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,680
executive team having a direct like one

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,600
of things I like to do with some of my

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,310
clients is when you reach a particular

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,110
status level is you get an email address

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,090
that goes directly to the executives of

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,340
the company and those executives will

00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,220
respond within 24 hours immediately you

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,210
get that highlight you get the bat phone

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,980
testimonials referrals these are all

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,310
different ways in which we can we can

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,010
build that sense of sense of validation

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,560
so in conclusion when thinking about how

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:53,040
we incentivize people focus on

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:56,220
acceptance reciprocation habit forming

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,140
and building authentic most importantly

00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,550
be authentic measure effectively

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,070
incentivize based on shared value and

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,330
reward effectively and I'm gonna be

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,560

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,540
