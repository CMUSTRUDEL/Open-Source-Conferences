	Buildroot: Making Embedded Linux Easy? A Real-Life Example - Yann Morin, Orange

Buildroot's motto is "Making Embedded Linux Easy" and advertises itself as being (in their own words) "a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded Linux systems through cross-compilation."

In this presentation, Yann will explain why and how Buildroot indeed made his and his colleagues lives easier while developing a new big project. Starting with an overview of the constraints that led to choosing Buildroot, Yann will investigate the Buildroot infrastructure and how he leveraged as much of those to provide his colleagues with an easy to use build environment.

Yann will also address the pain-points he encountered and how they were addressed, to end up with his colleagues' wish-list for Buildroot.
