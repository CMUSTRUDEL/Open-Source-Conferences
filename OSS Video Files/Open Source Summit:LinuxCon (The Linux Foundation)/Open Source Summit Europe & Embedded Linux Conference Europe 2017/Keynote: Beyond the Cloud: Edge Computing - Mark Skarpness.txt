Publication date: 2017-10-25
Playlist: Open Source Summit Europe & Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2017
Description: 
	Keynote: Beyond the Cloud: Edge Computing - Mark Skarpness, Vice President, Software and Services Group Director, Open Source Technology Center Datacenter System Software, Intel CorporationÂ 

As we move toward a world where everything is smart and connected, there is a massive flood of data. This considerable growth requires the data center to analyze and transform data at an unprecedented scale. These transformations are powered by an end-to-end infrastructure from the cloud and data center, the network, and the Internet of Things (lo.I), and are bound together by connectivity. 

Imad Sousou, Vice President of the Software and Services Group, and General Manager, Open Source Technology Center at Intel Corporation will highlight how we connect devices to the cloud, how edge computing accelerates the digital transformation, and how other open source software supports our rapidly changing world.

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:21,590
[Music]

00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:23,600
well good morning I last spoke at this

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,630
conference a couple of years ago and and

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,210
talked about IOT and today I'm excited

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,850
to be back to talk about sort of the

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,850
continuing evolution or revolution of

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:40,010
the overall intent architecture and as

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:42,890
Jim said the importance of the edge you

00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,860
know and we've talked about this coming

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,640
flood of devices you know 50 billion

00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,530
devices connecting driving traffic you

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,380
know and the number of devices is an

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,750
amazing thing but even more than that

00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,770
it's not the devices so much it's the

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,960
amount of data that is just growing

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,720
exponentially you know and I think we've

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,910
kind of thought about the Internet up

00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:13,520
until this point as being sort of I'm

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,350
uploading videos I'm watching videos I'm

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,170
using Facebook or Twitter or surfing the

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,550
web or whatever and that traffic is

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,580
continuing to grow

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,350
you know we're expecting to see a

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:28,100
gigabyte and a half of traffic per day

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,170
per person by 2020 which is a lot but

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,700
that is going to be completely dwarfed

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:37,040
by the data generated by devices and you

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,370
know a few examples of that you look at

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,650
a connected airplane five terabytes of

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,500
data per day generated by that aircraft

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,489
every single aircraft a smart hospital

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,650
three terabytes of data per day a

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,810
connected factory three petabytes of

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,940
data per day you know imagine a factory

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,200
that's got thousands of connected

00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,940
devices inside of it and they're all

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,700
generating data and you're using that to

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,739
improve your processes a self-driving

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,060
car he does something that's probably

00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:08,269
been talked about more than these other

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,420
use cases generating four terabytes of

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:13,690
data per day per car so just an absolute

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,480
explosion in the amount of data that's

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,130
going to be generated and obviously with

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,450
that amount of data being generated you

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,609
can't just send all that data to the

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,330
cloud and do analytics on it there and

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:26,760
I'll talk about you know there's a

00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,320
reasons for that beyond the fact that no

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,790
matter how fast your network is you just

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,370
simply can't transport that much data

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,340
you know in that time frame so this is

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,520
going to drive change in some of the

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,140
technologies that we're all working on

00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,300
you know and as obviously I don't need

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,120
to tell you open source is the

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,610
foundation of the antenna network that

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,040
we have today from the devices to the

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,710
network to the cloud and that's going to

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,160
continue to be true we've got some great

00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,780
technology building blocks already but

00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,850
there's new use cases and new

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,220
requirements that are coming and things

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,850
that we all need to work on to enable

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,530
this evolution to the edge and I'll talk

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,910
about a few examples of that and some of

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,450
the things we're working on and

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,380
obviously looking forward to all of your

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,530
collaboration as we work to build this

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,760
new set of open source technologies for

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,470
this world to come so cloud computing up

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,990
until now you know as you're all

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,510
familiar with has mainly been focused

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,510
around you know we generate data with

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,060
devices my mobile device we send that

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,980
into the cloud where it's stored and

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,110
then we use compute cycles to do

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,940
analytics and extract value you know

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,620
lots of examples of this this is the

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,550
world that we're all very very familiar

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,669
with and as we look forward we're going

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:51,480
to see that sort of storage computation

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:54,150
and analytics capability extend out it's

00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,220
going to extend out to the edge and to

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,620
the things themselves you know if you

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,020
think back to those examples I gave of

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,470
where this data is being generated think

00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,790
of the autonomous car is a great example

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,650
that's going to start to look like sort

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,990
of a mini data center mini cloud on

00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,900
wheels it's going to have all of those

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,479
capabilities to store and do computation

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,020
and analytics locally as well as being

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,430
connected to the cloud to do other

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,220
computation and analytics you know if

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,690
you're if you're in a car and you've got

00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,640
cameras and radar and lidar and you're

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,530
gathering all that data you need to make

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,870
real-time decisions on how to steer the

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,550
car and you can't send that data up to

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,590
the cloud and wait for an answer back on

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,300
which way to turn that's just not going

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,710
to work right the latency requirement is

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,330
way too tight to ever

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,920
do that and yet of course you're going

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,220
to be using lots of cloud services as

00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,680
well so you'll have that sort of rolling

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,570
data center device that's kind of a

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,150
combined edge device doing a bunch of

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,590
computation that architectural II kind

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,820
of looks like a data center and you're

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,890
going to need a lot of those same

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,600
capabilities but at a different scale

00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,540
you know if you think about the

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,980
connected factory or the connected

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,560
hospital you're going to have a whole

00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:07,110
collection of devices that live inside

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,970
of those environments that maybe aren't

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,910
capable of doing a bunch of compute

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,620
themselves but you'll see them connected

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,020
to local edge devices that are going to

00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,180
do some local analytics maybe you don't

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,680
want to send all of the patient data

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,060
into the cloud because of privacy

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,460
concerns you're going on do some

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,290
analytics on that locally and then some

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,120
of that data will go to the cloud so

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,490
we're evolving to this architecture

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,320
where you've got storage computer nettle

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,510
Linux distributed across the end-to-end

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,040
network and that's going to drive a need

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:39,600
for some new capabilities and new

00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,670
technologies and why is this coming now

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,730
you know I think we've talked about some

00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:47,250
of those reasons as these new use cases

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,950
evolve the autonomous car or the

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,130
connected plane you've got this need for

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:55,380
speed and and latency and locality of

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,680
compute that's going to drive you to do

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,240
some of these functions at the edge

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,820
security and privacy you know maybe I

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,160
don't want to send all of my data into

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,900
the cloud because there's privacy and

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,000
security concerns I want to be careful

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,710
and thoughtful about what do i compute

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,180
locally what do I share out into the

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:17,280
cloud a scalability you know with be an

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,530
incredible explosion of data that's

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,300
being generated you just simply can't

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,680
transport all of that data into a

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,360
central place you've got to be able to

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,640
spread that computation and analytics

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,770
throughout the entire end-to-end network

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,750
you know which is also related to cost

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,050
you know the network bandwidth even with

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,880
5g is going to continue to be a precious

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,160
resource and so we need to use it

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,630
carefully and balance what we compute

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,250
locally versus what we send over the

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,870
network so we're starting to see this

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,480
happen you know this is already starting

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,100
to come to be but over the next five

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,940
years this is going to become more and

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,010
more of a requirement more and more

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,430
common you simply won't be able to

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,930
deliver these new usages unless we're

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,480
able to create this world of an

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:03,190
end-to-end spectrum of compute and

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:05,410
analytics and storage of data so what

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,860
kind of technologies do we need to do

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:10,570
this we have a number of them already

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,850
you know containerization and

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,490
orchestration AI and machine learning

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,380
we're using all of those already and in

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,220
those cases this is more of an

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,830
adaptation

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,320
you know we've got great set of building

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,150
blocks open source technologies but

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,980
these are different use cases different

00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,570
scale different requirements so we're

00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,140
going to need to do some adaptation in

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:34,030
these areas 5g networking is going to be

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,099
an essential part of this if you think

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,659
about autonomous vehicles and how they

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,310
communicate to the network and with each

00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,630
other

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,890
5g is going to play a very big role on

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,940
that and as you heard from our pit

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,010
there's a bunch of open source

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,620
technologies in the software-defined

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,300
networking space that are essential you

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,730
could never build out the 5g network

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,790
using proprietary hardware and software

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,780
it's way too expensive and too slow so

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,900
open source is going to play a key role

00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:01,030
there functional safety is another I

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,770
think really interesting space you know

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,110
we at Intel have been working a lot in

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,140
and around the autonomous vehicle and

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,510
we're seeing this really interesting

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:13,420
transformation you know as the software

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,360
workloads inside of the car become

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,860
orders of magnitude more complex you

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,140
know traditionally the function only

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,090
safe systems in a car and to think about

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,620
the the software that's running your

00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,080
instrument panel your speedometer and

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,760
tachometer for example which is has to

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,870
be safety certified those have

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,760
traditionally been purpose-built

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,640
real-time operating systems really small

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,160
footprint simple but the next generation

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,560
of cars the software complexity is so

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,360
much bigger and the people building

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,000
those systems would love to use a fully

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,760
featured fully capable operating system

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,360
like Linux the Linux is not safety

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,160
certified or certifiable today and I

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,980
think that's a big challenge for all of

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,380
us and we started to work on this how do

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,270
we make and create an ecosystem around

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,970
Linux where Linux can actually be safety

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,260
certified and deliver all of the value

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,649
that we've built in Linux and the

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,839
current

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,490
in the core libraries into an ecosystem

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,199
that's really eager to have that

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,540
capability but can't use it today I

00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:13,029
think this is going to take years for us

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,399
to actually turn into a reality or at

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,689
the very beginning of that

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,699
time-sensitive networking again if

00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:20,740
you're moving real-time data around a

00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:23,139
vehicle for example you need to be able

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,119
to do that with latency guarantees and

00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,290
bandwidth guarantees and then finally

00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:28,059
how do we get all of these devices

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:32,110
onboard I'll talk a little bit more

00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:33,279
about those as well so let me click in

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,529
and just talk about a few things that

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,259
we're working on it related to this

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:41,939
space so containers now we've been doing

00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:44,829
some work on containers for the last

00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:47,769
couple of years and particularly looking

00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:50,199
at the security aspects of containers so

00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:51,610
you know Linux containers you're running

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:54,279
your containers on top of a common

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,069
kernel which gives you great scalability

00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,990
very lightweight but if that kernel is

00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:02,050
compromised the security of all of those

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,149
containers is at risk so obviously we've

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,089
had virtual machines for ever for more

00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,249
than 15 years and we've built inside of

00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,079
the Intel platform hardware capabilities

00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:14,019
to help make those virtual machines

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,459
secure so we had a couple of engineers

00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:17,889
are ian van de Ven and a couple other

00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,769
folks at Intel that that looked at you

00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,480
know why can't I apply this hardware

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:24,220
capability against containers and that

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,759
essentially is what clear containers is

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,829
you know so it's a container that uses

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,110
the underlying virtualization hardware

00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:34,120
to deliver security that's very similar

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,149
to a virtual machine but it's as

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,009
lightweight and fast as a container it's

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:41,170
hosted at clear Linux org it's an open

00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,999
source project and we've actually have a

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,529
demo of it out in the in the demo area

00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:46,899
if you want to see it in action in terms

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:48,790
of how it can fort some of the kernel

00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:51,249
exploits that could be used to attack

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,709
containers so a really cool example of

00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:54,999
how do I make a container more secure

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:58,199
and take advantage of some of the

00:11:54,999 --> 00:12:00,549
underlying hardware capabilities

00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:03,040
orchestration we've got orchestration

00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:04,389
solutions for the cloud today we've been

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,029
working on building a very lightweight

00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:10,779
Orchestrator it's called Chow cloudiness

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:12,879
integrated advanced Orchestrator we did

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,439
it initially and did some trials with in

00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,420
OpenStack to show how we could scale up

00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:18,610
to very large numbers of

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,200
in a very fast time frame but we're

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,180
really focusing this on the edge use

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,529
case now so how do I create an

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,440
Orchestrator that's really well-suited

00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:29,620
for this very lightweight kind of small

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,300
footprint context rather than a large

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,709
data center so another thing that we're

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,019
working on developing kind of looking

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:38,949
forward at the edge use case also hosted

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:40,329
on clear Linux org AI and machine

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:42,399
learning we've got some great open

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,110
source frameworks already and our work

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
has been mainly to plumb our hardware

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,269
acceleration into those frameworks so if

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,459
you're running tensorflow or cafe or

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,930
whatever your favorite framework is you

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:55,149
can take advantage of the underlying

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,160
hardware acceleration whether that's on

00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,899
a xeon or an FPGA or a purpose-built

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,970
accelerator and we're going to continue

00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,370
to do that I think what's going to

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,360
happen kind of uniquely at the edge is

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,040
you're going to see these frameworks

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,010
certainly running at the edge to do

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,930
inference but also combined inference

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,420
and training as you start to look at how

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,490
do I do more real-time adaptation of my

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,170
neural network at the edge or maybe I

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,790
have data in my training set that I

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,459
don't want to expose because it's

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,329
there's privacy or security concerns so

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:24,190
you're going to start to see these

00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:26,170
workloads running more and more at the

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,790
edge and also together both the training

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,079
part creating the model and the

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,490
inference part where you're using the

00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,199
model and we're going to continue to

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,910
work on making sure that these

00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:38,279
frameworks run great on top of our our

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,329
hardware platforms 5g we talked about

00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,100
coming in terms of driving a great

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:44,050
amount of bandwidth the other thing

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,000
that's really unique about 5g is it's

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,250
not only continuing to grow the mobile

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,890
bandwidth but it's also providing some

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,350
really unique new capabilities for both

00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:56,050
massive machine-to-machine communication

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,180
and also ultra ultra reliable low

00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,230
latency communication so you can imagine

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,269
if you have a bunch of autonomous

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,949
vehicles driving down the road they can

00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:05,709
actually use this ultra reliable low

00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:08,440
latency flavor of 5g to talk with each

00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:10,120
other and to do coordinated actions so

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,920
we think this is really exciting you

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,720
know we're obviously very actively

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,940
involved in driving the overall 5g

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,860
standardization but also working on a

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,690
bunch of the open source software

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,680
defined networking technologies that are

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,610
going to be needed to build these

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,860
networks going forward time sensitive

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,720
networking again inside of an autonomous

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,800
vehicle if you're moving sensor data

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,140
around in real time

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,089
just regular old Ethernet isn't good

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,680
enough you need to have latency

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,420
guarantees you need to have bandwidth

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,970
reservation so you're absolutely certain

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,070
that your critical data is delivered

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,890
where you need it to go with the right

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,690
timeliness so there's been standards

00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,450
work going on here for a while in the

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,579
Avenue group avnu and we were working in

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,870
the open avenue project which is

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,000
building out all of the linux

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,579
infrastructure that's required to fully

00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,839
support time-sensitive networking in a

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:04,870
linux platform and then finally device

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,079
onboarding you know back to this world

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,670
of 50 billion connected devices one of

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,380
the biggest challenges is how do I get

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,300
these devices onto the network in a

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,649
secure fashion how do I get them on the

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,200
network transparently

00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:20,050
and with zero touch so we've been

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,390
working on some new capabilities that

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:26,019
use a hardware chain of trust or you can

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:28,120
ship out a device turn it on have it be

00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,910
on boarded into the network securely and

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,829
transparently without any interaction in

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,600
a way that doesn't cause security

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:37,180
vulnerabilities you know a lot of times

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,770
today this is done using it using a

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,990
default password maybe or it requires

00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,700
some human interaction you know if

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,160
you're gonna onboard 50 billion devices

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,720
there can't be any humans involved so

00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,730
we've been working on integrating this

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,220
with for example the open connectivity

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,380
foundation and the i/o tivity project so

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,570
kind of an ongoing project to solve one

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,310
of the really hard problems in deploying

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,029
all of these edge devices securely

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,700
across the network so there's a lot of

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:06,160
work going on already in this end-to-end

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,089
space and we're involved in driving you

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,339
know some of the projects that I

00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:11,709
mentioned but also working in many many

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:14,410
of the open-source projects as we work

00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:15,579
to evolve the technology to support what

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,399
we think is going to be one of the

00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:20,440
really big next use cases around edge

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,029
computing and I'm really excited to

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,320
collaborate with all of you to make that

00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:28,449
a reality so we've got as I mentioned in

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,949
the booth just outside the door we've

00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:31,540
got a demo of the clear containers and

00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:33,640
some other cool demos that show some of

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,500
this want to make sure you're aware
