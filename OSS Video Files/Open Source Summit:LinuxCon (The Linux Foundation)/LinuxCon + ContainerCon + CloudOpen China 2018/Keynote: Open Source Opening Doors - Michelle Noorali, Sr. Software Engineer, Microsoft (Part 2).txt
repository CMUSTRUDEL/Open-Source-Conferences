Keynote: Open Source Opening Doors - Michelle Noorali, Sr. Software Engineer, Microsoft

Michelle Noorali, Sr. Software Engineer at Microsoft Azure and open source developer, talks about open source projects in the cloud-native ecosystem, the benefits of having an open source project in a foundation like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and the process of transitioning an open source project to the CNCF. Michelle currently serves on the Kubernetes Steering Committee, is on the governing board of the CNCF, and is a core maintainer of Helm, which was recently adopted into the CNCF. In this talk, Michelle will aim to inspire and inform other maintainers of open source projects on how to think about foundations as a long-term home for their open source project.
