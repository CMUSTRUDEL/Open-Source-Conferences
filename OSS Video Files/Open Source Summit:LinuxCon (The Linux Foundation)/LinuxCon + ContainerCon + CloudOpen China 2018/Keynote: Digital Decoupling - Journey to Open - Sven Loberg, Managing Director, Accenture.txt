	Keynote: Digital Decoupling - Journey to Open - Sven Loberg, Managing Director, Emerging Technology, Accenture

Driven by new consumer and market expectations, companies want to execute and scale innovation using open source technologies. But, they are often challenged by their current enterprise landscape. Legacy systems can shackle the Enterprise to decades of technical debt making changes highly complex and expensive. Yet, there is no appetite for large investments in massive re-platforming or other “big bang” transformations of the past.

A reactive, event-driven architecture can help enable decoupling from the technical debt within legacy systems and enable innovation on top of the core. In addition, it allows us to simplify or even replace the legacy core gradually over time. This creates rapid business value and de-risks transforming to a more flexible and innovation-friendly platform of the future.
