	Keynote: Digital Decoupling - Journey to Open - Sven Loberg, Managing Director, Emerging Technology, Accenture

Driven by new consumer and market expectations, companies want to execute and scale innovation using open source technologies. But, they are often challenged by their current enterprise landscape. Legacy systems can shackle the Enterprise to decades of technical debt making changes highly complex and expensive. Yet, there is no appetite for large investments in massive re-platforming or other “big bang” transformations of the past.

A reactive, event-driven architecture can help enable decoupling from the technical debt within legacy systems and enable innovation on top of the core. In addition, it allows us to simplify or even replace the legacy core gradually over time. This creates rapid business value and de-risks transforming to a more flexible and innovation-friendly platform of the future.

I'm happy to introduce our first seeker

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:14,139
who has been working open source and

00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:18,400
different technology in organization

00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:20,740
called eccentric since 2001 cell Ober is

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,640
the managing director of the emerging

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:27,640
technology he works with expensive

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,130
clients to help them leverage open

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,869
source in many ways ways to create

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,820
businesses to make their business more

00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:38,829
efficient please welcome to the stage

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:40,719
Center lower lower part of the

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,280
competitors emerging technology practice

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,460
I need an open source within extension

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,370
so I work with our clients to find their

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,890
next generation page architectures and

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,899
really that is open source like defaults

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,610
to today they talk about three different

00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,520
things a little bit about a competitor's

00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:00,160
journey taken over the last cause I

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,440
think as well as then how we then work

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,229
with our clients as far as whether it be

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,250
how to HTML to modernize some of their

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:07,900
legacy systems

00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,549
hopefully the leverage of entrepreneurs

00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,619
technologies or how do they even do

00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:13,390
business capabilities that you're

00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:15,159
looking at the ring at the market there

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,470
a little bit about some of the open

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,479
source initiatives that will partner

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,820
into the client it's part of those

00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,780
efforts modernized or to bring new

00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:28,689
capabilities super suits does briefly on

00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,880
expenses of the surgery so back about a

00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,320
decade so we incorporated inner source

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,390
we've got off three thousand different

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,049
projects going on for the Clintons to be

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,880
large

00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,310
what about whatever restarting your

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,580
about fifty thousand were about four

00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,780
hundred and forty thousand

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,430
for the last many years so with those in

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,660
a warned incorporate energy sources that

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,180
not because you know with his journey

00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,070
across thinking about the large since

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,470
integration was that we did four years

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,050
I'm still dude but more more that

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,110
hustles development became open source

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,610
right by default so that was a fig

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,410
Africa bar of course it's not being a

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,450
forest too much about seven or eight

00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,850
years ago we look at are looking towards

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,130
halt easy to find and rewrote it would

00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,230
encourage to uses not just to use but

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,630
the contribution so as many more

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,550
Millennials are joining a country it was

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,730
important that we allowed them and

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,040
really kind of encouraged right and that

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,900
is that you cannot just use open source

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,880
stuff be contributors to the various

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,710
communities out there which I'll talk a

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,570
little bit about or also you know are

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,760
are open source initiatives so certainly

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,500
they started with it absorbs family

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,420
moves you know a hospital again either

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,400
open source or starts to work with the

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,220
various open source communities found

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,810
agents so whatever efforts really right

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,130
now it's absolutely starts to measure a

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,410
lot of those things so we're working

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,000
with chaos and github and others as far

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,220
as have food porn about that

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,980
and then finally you know as far as what

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,230
we're doing now is really looking at

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,090
kind of diverse kind of ways to

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,650
contribute it certainly code is one way

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,690
that you contribute but given kind of

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,640
eccentric business or focused through

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,800
the kind of benefits of expertise

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,300
our roles is different as far as

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,310
depending on the various beauty that we

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,260
play some images around you a very

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,120
special applying different image to you

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,580
cases that we're familiar with as far as

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,470
based on a very cervicals some of its

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,940
writing documentation so I think it's

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,280
important abscesses think about it at

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,860
all which is you know so many of you are

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,430
looking or tribute to open source

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,950
projects or polygraphs

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,480
for that contributed it's not just about

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,879
you know contributes code that's very

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,829
important but also there's a lot more

00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,420
ways to contribute whether it be getting

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:38,750
involved in the meetups or whether it be

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,480
right the documentation or other various

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,950
forms so here's just briefly just to

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,469
give you a sense of some of the

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,359
movements or foundations and communities

00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:50,000
it accentuated particles certainly the

00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:53,090
Linux Foundation is a large access so

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,689
that somebody's a couple years ago we

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,060
hear a gold member of the Linux

00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:00,889
Foundation a solar system is ready to

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,510
review that tell it was thinking a

00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,689
little bit and since then we've joined

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,750
six so most recently the it seems yeah

00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:11,659
I'm foundations which reflects some of

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,489
the other region of the exemption really

00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:16,009
kind of where development is going with

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,410
tufts of development moving from we got

00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,120
about forty to fifty Java developers not

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,220
do a lot more Java super tight extremes

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,330
that reflect sort of that as well as

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,220
brought about beetle I changed so that's

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,370
what a lot of eccentric journey it was

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,080
love the toxin and if you absorb how you

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,669
paint either to be your governor to

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,500
others but now there talk a little bit

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:38,780
more about the how teams work with

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,060
clients so many clients you know are not

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,240
born in the cloud web scale companies

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,680
emitting them has thirty or forty years

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,659
of language EIT right the citizens that

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,970
are critical to their operations whether

00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:54,770
it be a poor baby sis and whether it be

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,690
at places some what does the red

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,900
baby these about the heart and soul of

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,000
what makes them wrong day to day but

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,139
right all these great technologies that

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,780
they're talking about yesterday the

00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,759
Cooper Davy with all these things that

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,009
are going on as far as this is becomes

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,440
really a service everything else right

00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,030
becomes open source they're left with

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,340
the paper what about all the stuff that

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,620
we already have so that's a lot of xn

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,240
talked with clients as well which is the

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,710
station great will help you the bond

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,080
your next generation application

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,729
architecture to look like but we

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,979
recognize that you have a whole bunch of

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,990
other stuff today that you'll need to

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,490
get modernized with some super format

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,280
the same sometimes the business is not

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,590
going to stop right so you know some of

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,319
the the challenges take out right these

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,240
these spices sorry order yourselves

00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,150
right that aren't going to cloud it has

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,520
its legacy right curses you know the

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,650
Challenger look at the the various

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,069
customer expectations are changing right

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,379
so the degree of personalization right

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:57,050
that a consumer inspects right currently

00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:59,509
with the various enterprises me for

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,630
example so I landed his DJ's basically

00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:05,840
for the first time on Saturday and we

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,840
dive into our first two parts when I got

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,240
off the plate and I got my bag was full

00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,370
of bees right we're far far enough and

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,039
that never had the you know taking a

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,430
taxi to task here but my first

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,300
destination was a packed fact you know

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,729
DJ's who I am

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,800
I see English I'm looking for a certain

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,349
type of car where take me right and

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,419
that's just by default right so that's

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,720
the expectations of many clients right

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,420
as far as the customers

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,640
are right that the other aspect right

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,470
but far as the technology debate you

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,090
constantly open source you look at that

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,390
you might have change the perfect right

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,710
Joaquin I have a key server list a on

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:48,120
right all these things that have these

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:50,460
fashions bastard right and many of the

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,990
business wanna capabilities around these

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,330
switch but what do they do

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,430
right also right you have the challenges

00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:00,240
as far as ecology is emerging as far as

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:03,120
a new market entrance right so in the

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,340
case of Marriott's right of the world or

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,190
other market or dollars Airbnb right

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,920
from me and now being larger largest

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,140
Seneca hotels face like in the world

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,510
larger than many of the largest hotel

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,330
extreme bond right persuasion and okay

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,910
now that they have to do right as well

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,530
as in the blurring of industries

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,140
boundaries right do you not have

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,630
certainly the Alibaba the Amazon right

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,640
concern up a let's do wanna on retail

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,320
but now it's all that okay what else

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,290
tonight you might become a bank and I

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,270
can come someone that can it be a

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,950
distributor of medicines right all these

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,430
other things right but it sounds good

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:43,800
I needed ' right so the reality is many

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,810
CIOs today right build out these will

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,850
lock your feet anymore more budget right

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,680
in fact the times it's you know secretes

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,050
it right there business as usual if

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,550
they've actually decreased at the same

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,390
time they're looking to do you know more

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,160
with less

00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:00,060
that's kind of the situation together

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,770
and combined with that there's fanfic

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,020
and want to be able to innovate more and

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,669
more is where many of them is it is

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,520
fault is the discuss community her

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,710
varieties customer which is okay maybe

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,290
he's you know kind of enterprise we

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,690
started out with you know you would for

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,120
citizens right though the smart citizens

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:22,570
became you know modified it over

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,600
decades right elbow patents rough that

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,610
good right there okay new change okay

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,900
add something to it customizes whether

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,960
it be a package or something

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,610
Russell so as that evolution curve

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,260
happened right they were able to

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,360
introduce to you capabilities very

00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,719
easily but they're capable point where

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,520
one dollar invested that used to receive

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,680
$10 worth the return on investment if

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,480
you now put $2 to get that same as

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,820
return then it's three minutes more and

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,980
it's five writing for now you know at

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,860
the bottom is essentially you know where

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,750
it physically become you know a point

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,640
where business cases are no longer able

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,820
to be done right because it tastes has

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,110
much more to make changes right because

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,240
the only thing to do is do the

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,660
regulatory another kind of things that

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,060
are have to do I place right at that

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,830
point essentially you know the IT

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,050
organization see someone's face right in

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,970
the sense that they can no longer do any

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,610
changes right besides those regulatory

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,970
points this is played with a lot of our

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,860
crime-fighting sense right

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,720
so how can they do this right they no

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,240
longer having hundreds millions of

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,800
dollar programs anymore

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,500
business wants it will be minimal Viable

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,600
Product see it out change quickly bring

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,660
new things to market about the same kind

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,550
of sad with this legacy IP rights model

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,700
of existence in some cases that are very

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,520
difficult to make a move to right so

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,709
what they need is right ultimately what

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,990
we talk you start looking at resistance

00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:51,940
is helpin dating I'm not that data a lot

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,540
of times whether these systems aren't

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,480
very apt or they may be doing kind of a

00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,839
large million billion

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,240
in some cases they're great

00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,610
Sifl maintains to them they have data

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,180
blocks incisor right that are very

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,760
gently the other as fast as far as II

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,339
don't get access to those they very

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,410
would be very attractive right so a lot

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,180
of it is helping me unlock the data in

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,370
these various model in existence I

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,230
possibly be that instructional services

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,730
right that provide those those

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,430
capabilities that we want to be able to

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,360
field on the edge right to existence

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,769
differentiation we still want to have

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
that court system does know the sports

00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,970
distance they're going to a ball idea T

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,000
whether it be okay but either to be able

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,740
to modernize those either get them back

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,720
to the point where they are going to do

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,269
their core functions and not other

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,889
things build the veterans microservices

00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:45,209
are the things that are very nipple and

00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:48,360
be able to make them small we're going

00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:50,040
to change right or the move exact like

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,630
that can happen to a point where this is

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,339
something that when we built this 20

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,490
years ago this is really differentiated

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:59,339
but the reality is now this is 95% of

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,230
what other businesses or industries use

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,600
as well okay that makes far more sense

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,339
to do it what's Tobias after that let

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,649
Soviets on what we're going to process a

00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,180
system of differentiation but how can I

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,220
make that HP middle during hot enough

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,410
unlock that data how can we start to

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,300
build services but I can make those kind

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,850
of plausible case to incorporating

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,740
business capability maybe slowly evolved

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,040
from that legacy systems to more of a

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,930
micro service cloud native architecture

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,240
but if it ain't on the employer Ron so

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,550
that may be in place with legacy systems

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,410
overclock so this is a little bit of the

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,839
journey starts to look like so you have

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,880
that core systems right the content of

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,070
the bills kind of expanded

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,400
many right in hot

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,950
the introduction of a date away it may

00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,460
start discrete phase or absence or on

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,450
automation like RP a robotic automation

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,580
right the office questions take a look

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,680
at the during Tuesday's class right

00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,850
whether it be private public is filed in

00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,230
general they start to do that right so

00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,730
that's the first jobs incorporating a

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,790
Bailey threatens build a bit of a

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:05,580
services layer but then if the next Jebb

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,620
would be how can we this is where it to

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,480
be reactive for the event-driven

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,920
architecture which is really where we

00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,140
see kind of the next generation

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,820
applications going right good really

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,310
how could we know ok it's kind of that

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,010
next up how could we make these systems

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,410
more effective than adventures in the

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,870
media ok that we can have things happen

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,280
agent asleep everything be kind of

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,810
interactive because you don't have to

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,450
worry about all those inner dependencies

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,160
that is really the problem of this

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,540
monolithic system that all these you

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,420
know dependencies are difficult to make

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,070
changes so that's that's really want to

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,680
get you want to get you more of a data

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,570
event based approach that we can have

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,220
those services that are completely

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,920
independent we're still deviating access

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,420
the data which is great but how do we

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,780
get there what are the building blocks

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,630
to get there so one of those is a cagey

00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,580
to capital coach the idea is okay all

00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,980
these model of existence how many layers

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,570
they have what's in them on the didn't

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,100
kind of integration points in reality to

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,440
set all the data off specifically

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,420
trickles down from data source right the

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,430
idea is be kind of in another proof of

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,380
system of record it gets persistence

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,820
right click this somewhere right whether

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,290
it be a mainframe whether it be

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,210
distributed systems because you're

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,250
finished right and if you think it have

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,500
to those changes right could be obtained

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,470
today the capital court of quality PD is

00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,730
you replicate that now you can start to

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,430
get that ability you can unlock that

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,410
data okay if you don't like that data

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,540
okay

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,370
that more of that base so using the

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,730
advances in technology will to be cocked

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,110
or other data streams right putting that

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,470
and kind of making that now neatly

00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,180
pushed onto those event coverage back

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,040
right and if we have been my

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,879
conservative seventy build on top of

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,319
those right but the trick to me okay

00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:50,180
everywhere we talked about microservices

00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:52,009
they're like yeah reactive architecture

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,629
if you really like to do that but you

00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,339
know working with the benefits of car

00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:57,290
it's the same challenge on the UI

00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,920
he's a great feel to have a negative

00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,660
events well through the fittest okay but

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,980
okay necessary is difficult to do so

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,480
we're gonna compete II did you kind of a

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,360
similar kind of more service-oriented

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,740
architecture that you know still is more

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,240
about the layer you kind of have various

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,550
racial or levels of integration a

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,040
serious enough consumers of the services

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,050
package out who they're calling really

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,629
the shifted okay popularly get those two

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,790
how can we make it easier to be

00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:25,339
event-driven consume events to push

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,689
events that would really challenge that

00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,069
we kind of solved with something the

00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:30,050
polymer reacted interacts with gateway

00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:32,120
so the reactive interactive gateway base

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,800
and make it very easy you can assume

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,850
events there are a whole series of

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,829
different protocols

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,930
whether it be in Fargo ready to be with

00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:41,300
a real first WebSockets others and

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,120
that's what enables a basically in this

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,160
picture which is the idea okay if we can

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,230
have legacy systems that we can start

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,880
doing occasion a capital approach to

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,339
push those events have something that

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,410
then puts those events on an event help

00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,970
screen okay great okay now that we have

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,589
that

00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,259
have microservices that we're building

00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,819
new capability to drop or taking legacy

00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,980
systems right that we're gonna say is

00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:04,689
this possibility here here and here

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,339
we're gonna rewrite that we need the

00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:10,209
major than you sign right we're going to

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:12,430
now define this as a micro service we're

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,569
gonna plug it into the event hub right

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,990
every constructor you can assume that

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:18,610
we're gonna eventually strangle off or

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,259
at least a good portion of it and that's

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,870
actually kind of heading it what it

00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,730
really is a poor Pizza fault yeah it

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,490
looks really you know kind of some of

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,500
that bandaid that kind of you know that

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,180
song right my property has been there in

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,709
the first place like he became cactus

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,959
with dad at the fun that we have done a

00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,920
graduate right can you technologies we

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,300
could have seen it in the future

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,430
who would have built this micro services

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,399
to your side so now those are micro

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,339
services right we can now have the UI's

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,959
right with the UI like the challenge

00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:49,420
there okay you want them to be able just

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,459
to supersize right we don't have to

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,740
compose the complexity of having a

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:55,209
single page that have to be able to

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,680
consume designer so that's where it

00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,329
comes is they can work with the I

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,459
managed at the product up there a flaw

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:02,259
but it basically makes it very easy to

00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,899
do thank you do it at a very large scale

00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:06,550
and then also if you have any serious

00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,949
notification services and other

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:12,610
commentators okay this is normally a

00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:14,019
demo but not today far as didn't have

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,730
time to prepare was about to show it to

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,680
you but basically now that you have the

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,240
bed flowing through the system right

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,709
everything is down with that whether it

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,660
be a key source that company and a

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:24,339
single page that whether it be something

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,959
that's happening you push it like if the

00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,730
system is not being pushed to the event

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:30,100
hub whether it's a micro service

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,870
everything talking into us right now you

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,430
can plug in

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,500
the other things things like going

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,120
across them the event I write goes very

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,290
straight right you want any kind of

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,430
real-time out of it okay whether you

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,430
wanna do all these various notifications

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,560
right for the beauty of it is okay we

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,150
didn't nothing dinner dependence right

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,040
anything could plug into the event hub

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,990
starts too soon the manticore admitted

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,030
that's right everyone can then you know

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,950
benefits problems from the identify so

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,420
that's where the future ear that's a

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,480
little bit of what we're taking in all

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,220
rigs yet but we active interactive game

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,060
face on the literature in a number of

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,190
technologies just actually this week she

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,350
came a project Indiana co-stars it could

00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,200
be at a project so he really go check it

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,580
out sorry it's open source so if

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,200
something that we want to work certainly

00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,820
you know what the broad broader cloudy

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,310
the Community Foundation is a broader

00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:23,710
kind of open source communities on we

00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,380
think it's high-style right so like I

00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,760
said it exudes a TP passcode thesis

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,650
we're working with all the various other

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,210
cloud providers already saying what

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,340
other things that we should be able to

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,470
provide and working with the Department

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,750
of managed service around the different

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,360
cloud providers so certainly go check it

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,220
out really looking forward to talking

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,240
with you for the remainder of the day

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,090
and certainly kind of in the broader

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,230
landscape as far as the marketplace in

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,230
