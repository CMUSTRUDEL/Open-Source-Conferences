well so that's it and I hope you enjoy

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,579
the week I thought I would start our

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,970
event by giving you a little bit of an

00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:13,880
update on the Linux Foundation and on

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,489
open source and the number one message

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,959
that I'd like to talk about today is

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:24,049
that our world is not a zero-sum game

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:28,690
you know open source is the world's

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:32,600
greatest example of how people can help

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:35,630
others while helping themself at the

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:41,570
same time that there doesn't need to be

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:45,680
a winner and a loser that everybody can

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:50,390
win by cooperating together to produce

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:55,570
great technologies right everybody can

00:03:50,390 --> 00:04:00,440
win together even competitors in

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:04,609
technology the fiercest competitors work

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,340
together to help each other while

00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:08,570
competing at the same time this is a

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,040
important thing I want you all to

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:15,590
understand is open source the movement

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,230
is all about

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,870
everyone benefitting together it doesn't

00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,510
matter who you are it doesn't matter

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,449
what company you're from it doesn't

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:30,229
matter what country you're from together

00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:31,840
we are making great technology solving

00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:36,979
some of the world's most difficult

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:41,500
problems and we are succeeding now how

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:45,290
do I know this how can I be so sure that

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,780
open source is not a zero-sum game that

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,510
all of us can win even if we're

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,320
competitors working together how can I

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:57,950
be so sure

00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:02,840
well because Linux is the example the

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:07,160
existence proof that open source works

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,520
that working together works look at this

00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,330
Linux is the most successful software

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,520
project in the history of computing look

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,520
at these numbers it's the number one in

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,880
an Internet client with Android it is

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:28,789
has 90% of the world's public cloud

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:31,099
workloads it has 100 percent of the high

00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:34,900
performance computing and supercomputer

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:39,080
market the top 500 markets out there

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:43,060
Linux is the existence proof the example

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:47,180
that together we are stronger than apart

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:52,220
and the Linux Foundation is showing that

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,400
not just with Linux but with many many

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,789
other technologies Linux was the

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,740
beginning and now we're working across a

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:04,099
wide range of different technologies

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,530
together whether it's securing the

00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:08,000
Internet the Linux Foundation is home to

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,000
the world's largest certificate

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,760
authority let's encrypt it's an easy

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,310
free certificate apt-get let's encrypt

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,419
we're home to cybersecurity initiatives

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,270
like the corinth the structure

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,580
initiatives in networking the linux

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,790
foundation is helping companies here in

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,000
China China Mobile China

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,160

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,390
operators from all over the world

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:38,020
whether it's AT&T Bell Canada NTT and

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:40,870
others to automate their mobile networks

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,600
their production telecommunications

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:47,350
systems through our Software Defined

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:52,240
Networking projects onap opendaylight

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:55,660
and many many more in cloud computing we

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,060
are home to the cloud native computing

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,310
foundation how many people here have

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,410
heard of kubernetes people here know

00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,050
kubernetes all right most of you

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:08,080
hopefully by the end of the week all of

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,060
you will know kubernetes we're also here

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,880
to home to one of the world's most

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,930
successful paws platforms cloud foundry

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:20,110
in automotive we have a project called

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,510
automotive grade Linux creating a

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:27,010
next-generation automotive experience

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:31,030
that is now in production in 20 20

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,940
million automobiles worldwide companies

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,560
like Toyota Ford Honda and others are

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,740
participating in our automotive

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,110
initiative sort of redefining what the

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,430
software experience in a car is all

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:49,020
through open source all the code is open

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:52,380
just last week mercedes-benz announced

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,000
that they're going to use open source

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,420
automotive grade Linux Mercedes Benz in

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,460
Germany for their production commercial

00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,990
vans

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:07,480
these are our vans that deliver the

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:11,080
products all over Germany drones come

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,890
out of these vans and bring the packages

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:18,610
that they're delivering to the end

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:22,120
receiver in blockchain technology we

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,490
have a project called hyper ledger hyper

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,230
ledger is actually being used here in

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:32,710
China to track the supply chain for food

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:35,110
and other services here in China and all

00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,180
over the world it's being used to track

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,969
the Diamond Supply

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,820
i chain to make sure that people don't

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,740
use illegal diamonds across that supply

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,910
chain it's used in financial services

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,100
and many many more in embedded we have

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,550
zephyr which is a real-time operating

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,560
system for tiny embedded devices the

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:00,100
Yocto project which is the dominant

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,680
embedded Linux build tool used by the

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,350
vast majority of companies and

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,290
individuals creating embedded Linux

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:11,160
systems and then finally in web

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,990
technology were home to the node.js

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,750
foundation node.js how many people here

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,290
know nodejs pretty much everyone it's

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:23,110
the most popular server-side JavaScript

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,060
technology used to make app almost every

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,339
modern web application mobile

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:31,410
application it is an incredibly popular

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:35,399
open source project this is an amazing

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:37,990
collection of open source technologies

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,990
you know the Linux Foundation through

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:46,470
these projects is really creating big

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:49,990
big big results today we have over

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:54,700

all working together thousands of

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:09,010
developers across hundreds of product

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:14,940
projects creating billions of dollars

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:18,240
worth of technology all together in 2018

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,910
the Linux Foundation is adding a new

00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:10,279
him he is the one of the founders of the

00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:12,980
Apache Software Foundation original

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,019
creators of the Apache web server Dan

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,029
Khan who runs our cloud native computing

00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,040
foundation is here this week he did the

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,519
first commercial transaction over the

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,859
Internet

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,980
way back in the early 90s and then

00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:27,649
finally we have a new team member on

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,889
Linux Foundation Jamie Smith is our new

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:34,069
head of communications Jamie comes to us

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:37,249
she her last job she worked for

00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:40,160
President Barack Obama as his deputy

00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:42,410
press secretary and she's going to help

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,220
us to communicate the value of

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,649
open-source

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,480
to different people different

00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:50,600
organizations in different countries all

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,939
over the world it's a great team and

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,789
we're very proud of them and of course

00:11:52,939 --> 00:12:00,309
it's not just the Linux Foundation

00:11:55,789 --> 00:12:05,419
that's growing open-source is growing

00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:08,239
everywhere today there are millions of

00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:11,179
open-source developers in fact since I

00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:13,160
created this graphic the number of

00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:17,449
developers working on open source has

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,609
increased from 23 million to 28 million

00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:23,779
it's amazed I think this is maybe six

00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:28,189
months old on github today there are 78

00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:32,119
million repositories every day another

00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:35,539
thousand new open source projects are

00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:37,489
created and 10,000 different new

00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:39,230
versions of existing open source

00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:41,929
projects are created that is an

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:45,470
incredible trend and that just keeps

00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:50,299
going up and up and up because all of us

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:53,089
know the power of working together the

00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:58,779
Linux Foundation was also awarded late

00:12:53,089 --> 00:13:02,780
last year the SD x award for inner

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:06,050
influencers this is interesting because

00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,960
this award is given from a famous

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,540
publication in Silicon Valley so this is

00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,940
sort of a big Silicon Valley honor to

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,740
get this award but the part I wanted to

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,990
show you the part I'm proud about here

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,170
is if you look at the companies who got

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,690
this award in 2017 Apple Facebook Google

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,380
IBM Intel Microsoft github Netflix

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:30,050
reddit slack the Linux Foundation were

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,900
the only nonprofit organization in there

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:36,350
which is amazing but here's what's even

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:39,490
more interesting three of the award

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:42,980
winners for this very prestigious prize

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:46,610
github Red Hat and Linux Foundation are

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:50,690
really open source organizations that's

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:54,290
how important open source is across the

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:57,500
world and of course I really have to

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:00,260
mention github right did everybody see

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,170
the github purchased by Microsoft did

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:06,230
anybody see this was a big deal right

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:10,850
so github Microsoft bought github for

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:13,970
seven point five billion dollars it's an

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:16,700
amazing amount of money and you know

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:20,300
it's interesting you know github is a

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,910
really really good tool and Microsoft is

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,800
a really really good developer company

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,680
they love developers they always have

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,780
since Bill Gates founded Microsoft and I

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,680
personally think that that Microsoft is

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:37,490
going to do a good job as a steward of

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:42,140
github github reminds me of a few things

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,750
one get is such an important technology

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,430
I want to thank Minas Torvalds for

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,920
creating it because it really changed

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:52,040
technology the second important thing to

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:57,140
understand about github is that github

00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:01,010
created the era of social coding it was

00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,830
github that allowed more developers to

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,750
very easily collaborate and increase the

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:10,010
number of open-source developers from a

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:11,870
million to now twenty eight million so I

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,730
think Microsoft was smart in buying

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,080
github here's something that's really

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,590
interesting about github

00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,370
this

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:23,800
how important it was to Microsoft the

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:28,280
founders of github now own as a

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:31,880
percentage more stock in Microsoft than

00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,220
the CEO of Microsoft such a Nadella it's

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,270
a it's just an amazing example of how

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:41,900
important open-source is to a company

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:45,380
like Microsoft and the world and of

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:49,850
course at the Linux Foundation our job

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:53,390
is to make the open source engine go

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:57,490
faster at the Linux Foundation our job

00:15:53,390 --> 00:16:01,400
is to host great open source projects

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:05,480
that companies companies that all of you

00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:08,600
participate in use to make commercial

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,610
products and services whether you're a

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,700
government organization or a private

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:17,000
company you take open-source code you

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:20,480
use it to create a mobile device a cloud

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,590
computing service a website you name it

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:28,420
and then that creates value in the form

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:32,110
of profit that profit allows companies

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:36,890
like the ones you see here to assign

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:39,710
engineers to work on the project more

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:43,340
engineers work on a project more code

00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:46,040
more improvements that create better

00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,950
products better products create more

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,800
profit people reinvest back in the

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:55,220
project you get better code better

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,830
products more profits better projects or

00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,270
products better profits you see how this

00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:04,700
works this is a sustainable ecosystem

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:08,959
this is a sustainable financial system

00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:12,920
where all of us can win nobody needs to

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:16,390
lose everybody can win and at the Linux

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:19,850
Foundation we think of these like gears

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:23,180
the project's create solutions or

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:28,630
products create value and profit and our

00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:33,400
job at the Linux Foundation is to be the

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:37,270
host of open-source projects to be the

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,270
best open-source upstream for a

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:44,040
commercial downstream and so over many

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:49,090
years we've created a methodology a

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:52,210
system to help developers create

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,550
successful open-source projects to

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,190
identify value to create a legal

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,470
framework to be able to create a

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,600
governance structure so that developers

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,170
and business people can make decisions

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,630
together in a neutral way we've created

00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:11,110
systems for developers to promote these

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:14,559
projects we've created tools that allow

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:17,020
the ease of new developers to come in

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,540
and participate in open source projects

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,000
we've created marketing methodologies to

00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,309
help promote open source so that more

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,030
developers and more companies can come

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:34,540
into these open source projects the next

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:38,920
step is solutions and I'm going to talk

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:41,500
about today how your job people who

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,170
consume open source and use it to make

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,780
products how you can all get better at

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:49,150
that right I think it's really important

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,720
for the Linux Foundation to be good at

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:55,090
projects so that all of you can be good

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,390
at using open source to create

00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,920
interesting products and services and so

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,080
one of the things that we're doing at

00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:06,520
the Linux Foundation is creating guides

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,490
and tutorials on how to be a good

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:13,510
consumer of open source how to bring

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,820
code into your company to change it to

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:18,040
share those changes back so you don't

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,370
have to maintain the code by yourself

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:24,520
and then continue to participate in

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,130
these open source communities we're also

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,250
creating a series of guides to show all

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,220
of you how to make money from open

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,679
source people always ask me if open

00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:39,670
source is free how do I make money well

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,950
in 2018 billions of dollars in value

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,560
billions of

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,750
dollars in value is being created in

00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,270
open-source we're creating guides for

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:52,740
all of you to show you how you can make

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:56,940
money in open-source you see what we

00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:01,110
really care about is helping projects go

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,660
from a small unknown project up to a

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,690
very very important project that

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:11,550
everybody uses every day something like

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:14,970
Linux that's the goal if we can get

00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:19,230
these gears to spin faster better

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:21,440
projects better solutions more value we

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,600
are going to create more valuable

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,720
open-source projects and we have lots of

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:31,110
examples of this at the Linux Foundation

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:34,370
here's one example and networking global

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:38,100
operators need to get ready for 5g in

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:42,360
order to enable all the wonderful value

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:45,630
in 5g the low latency the faster data

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,660
speeds the larger number of users the

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:53,220
billions of connected devices you have

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:57,840
to automate the entire telecommunication

00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:02,010
network so at the Linux Foundation AT&T

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,230
and China Mobile came to us and said we

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:07,590
want to create a network automation tool

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,970
in open source together even though

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,370
we're from different countries different

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,850
companies we want to do this

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,220
together and so we worked with AT&T in

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,080
China Mobile who had two different code

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,900
bases China Mobile had created something

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,180
here in China called open l AT&T had

00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,700
created something called ecomp we

00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,700
brought them together to create the open

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,640
network automation from platform we

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:39,360
launched that a little over a year and a

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:41,730
half ago and in that period of time 65%

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,120
of the world's telecommunications

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:48,290
companies are now committed to adopting

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,110
the open Network automation platform

00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:55,049
AT&T alone is saying that they're saving

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:58,440
over 1.6 billion dollar

00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:00,630
annually through this technology it said

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,830
it's an amazing success of open source

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:08,730
in the cloud native computing foundation

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:11,580
in 2015 Google came to the foundation

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:15,210
and said we have this great technology

00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:17,450
called kubernetes and we want to

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:22,320
contribute it to the open source world

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:26,220
we want to work with our competitors to

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:30,059
help developers embrace cloud native

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:33,419
development container based application

00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:37,350
development container based management

00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:41,370
and orchestration modern CI CD and

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:46,020
DevOps workflows and we went in 2015

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:48,960
with kubernetes and worked to create a

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,990
portability layer a way that containers

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,409
can be managed across different private

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:59,549
and public clouds easily and you know

00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:01,679
what it worked three years later in 2018

00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:07,429
the cloud native computing foundation

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:11,240
has over 200 members they have 53

00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:15,539
kubernetes certified service providers

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,390
that's 53 private and public clouds that

00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:20,760
are committed to consistency across

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,220
different implementations so that when

00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,700
you write a cloud native application

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:29,730
it's easier for you to bring it from one

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,010
cloud to another cloud that's a huge

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:35,970
accomplishment in open source and that

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:39,720
all came from big competitors Google

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:43,080
Microsoft Amazon Alibaba 10 cent a

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:48,350
huawei others all working together

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:51,450
IBM many many others finally in

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,640
automotive as I mentioned earlier our

00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:56,000
automotive grade Linux platform was

00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,260
started by some of the most conservative

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,090
automotive companies in the world in

00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,690
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:09,890
and in just a short period of time in

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:12,950
five years in five years we are now in

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,840
20 million production vehicles it's an

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:18,490
amazing amazing success all right you

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:21,309
know in 2012 most automobile companies

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,840
didn't really make much software

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,360
software was new to the automotive

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,330
industry and so they were struggling to

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,390
work on software what did they do they

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:34,490
leveraged open source to create

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:37,700
automotive software so the message today

00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,919
is let's get these gears spinning faster

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,559
and faster and faster that's why we're

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,600
here this week talk to each other about

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,059
how we can make good upstream projects

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,279
that create good downstream products

00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:53,270
that create value for everyone that's

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:56,690
why we are here this week and you know

00:24:53,270 --> 00:25:00,860
the Linux Foundation is very committed

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:06,049
to China this is a country we want to

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:10,149
invest in and we're very very happy to

00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:13,549
see that Chinese industry is also

00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:16,789
investing in the Linux Foundation and on

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:22,250
that note I'd like to introduce someone

00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:26,120

able to go find interesting information

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:33,820
about open source so please go check out

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,590
our new Linux Foundation website again

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:41,230
it's at Linux Foundation

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:45,190
dot C yet finally we are publishing some

00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:47,430
guides on open source so remember I told

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:50,860
you about we're going to produce

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:53,740
material to teach you how to be good at

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:57,970
using open source well we did it and

00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:00,640
it's available in Chinese today for all

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:03,760
of you so go to a Linux Foundation at CN

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,860
website we have these guides from our to

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,650
do group that can teach you and your

00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,830
company how to use open source please go

00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:16,870
ahead and use them today so

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:18,760
with that I'd like to also announce that

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,600
the Linux Foundation is working on a

00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:25,420
project called call for code

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,700
speaking of large global problem solving

00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,580
the Linux Foundation is working on a

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:34,030
project called call for code with IBM

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:37,600
the United Nations and many others that

00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:40,840
is challenging developers to solve big

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,050
problems around climate change to

00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:47,320
produce code to solve problems in order

00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,540
to help with disaster recovery and

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:57,300
climate change problems please go check

00:30:49,540 --> 00:31:00,580
it out it's call for code.org and hope I

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,840
snuck it out there so one of the things

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,550
I wanted to show you how do we get back

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,860
to this pet where's the penguin here I'm

00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:11,730
having problems with my slides we go no

00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:13,930
you're killing my joke all right

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,280
everybody knows that the Linux penguin

00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:20,980
is black and white correct

00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,470
so leanest Torvalds loves black and

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,340
