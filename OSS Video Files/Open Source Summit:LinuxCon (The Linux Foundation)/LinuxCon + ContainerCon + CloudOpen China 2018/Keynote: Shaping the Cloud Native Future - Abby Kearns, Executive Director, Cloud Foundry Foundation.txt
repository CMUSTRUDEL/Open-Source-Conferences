Description: 
	Keynote: Shaping the Cloud Native Future - Abby Kearns, Executive Director, Cloud Foundry Foundation

Cloud Foundry is an integral part of the movement creating interoperability among the open source, cloud-native ecosystem. Complementary, interlocking open source technologies like Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and the Open Service Broker API are shifting the way industries function. These technologies weave together flexibility and application development for virtually any type of business.

What began as a grassroots movement among developers has mushroomed into a massive collaborative community. Linux laid the groundwork in 1991, and the Linux Foundation continues to host the worldâ€™s leading open source projects. Today projects like Cloud Foundry and Cloud Native Computing Foundation, as well as standards like the Open Container Initiative, effectively serve as the voice of the people. The developers creating these projects are defining the next generation of technology infrastructure.

In this talk, Abby Kearns will discuss the importance of interoperability, and how it is critical to the future success of technologies. Abby will also discuss the role that open source plays in cloud technologies -- delivering a flexible, scalable strategy to drive the future of business.

our next speaker is a leader in the

00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,940
open-source community she is the

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,009
executive director of the Cloud Foundry

00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:18,570
foundation has been working in

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,640
technology for 20 years and is here to

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,000
talk to us today about the role of

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,369
open-source in companies that are

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,250
transforming themselves through software

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,400
development the key to of

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,710
interoperability in that process please

00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,360
welcome to the stage executive director

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:45,600
of the Cloud Foundry foundation Abbi

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:48,510
currents Nihao thank you for coming for

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,620
the last day of lc3 it's great to see

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,320
all of you I am super excited to be in

00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:00,840
Beijing even though it's a little bit

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:04,260
warm this week today I want to talk

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,549
about cloud and how it's changing all of

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,969
our worlds but first I wanted to take

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,909
you on a little bit of a journey have

00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:21,539
you ever made a choice that changed your

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:28,200
life maybe got on a trip that opened

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:33,350
your mind like the Great Wall or taking

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,350
a new job that launched your career

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:42,420
recently I made a choice I chose to stop

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:46,740
going to my bank in fact I moved all of

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:50,819
my money to a new bank a new bank that's

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,450
digitally native from day one it was

00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:58,229
simple easy to use and it put me in

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:02,909
control control over my time control

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:07,139
over my money but if you're a

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,050
traditional bank customers like me scare

00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:12,920
you they make you nervous I'm willing to

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,750
move all of my money to a new bank

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,910
because it's easy to use because of the

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,580
text

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:26,120
I chose my new bank because of the way

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:30,099
that it uses the cloud and like so many

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,500
industries they're moving into the cloud

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:36,260
banks are in the cloud retell is in the

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,390
cloud even pizza-delivery is in the

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,280
cloud

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:47,090
everything is moving their industries to

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:49,040
the cloud and organizations around the

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,180
world are now having to piece together

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,560
solutions to make that work

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,110
they're pulling together a variety of

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,360
vendors technologies and solutions and

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,069
it's complicated and it makes you know

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,890
how do you know where to choose how do

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,180
you know what's direction to go and

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,890
fundamentally how do you know the impact

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,840
that's going to have on your existing

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:16,940
business and if you're thinking about

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,849
the cloud what do you what do you really

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,760
could comes to mind what comes to mind

00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:25,609
is I need to innovate I need to come up

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,209
with new ideas and get those into

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:31,519
production as quickly as possible oh and

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,650
at the same time this new and innovative

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,709
technology needs to work with what I

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:42,349
have and all of this needs to come

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:44,510
together in a single solution a cloud

00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:47,870
native technologies and cloud native

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,060
applications are just growing over the

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,060
next 18 months we're going to see it

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,650
hundred percent increase and the number

00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:00,549
of cloud native applications

00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:05,180
organizations are writing and using and

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:07,459
in China alone there is a massive

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,900
increase in the investments of these

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:14,389
technologies so not just confess ting an

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,400
IT anymore you're investing in cloud and

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:21,709
cloud technologies and for those of you

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,870
in China you're thinking about also how

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,840
does this map to the new and innovative

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,530
industries that are part of the made in

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,290
China

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:35,510
twenty-five initiatives for each and

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:39,620
every one of you your world has gotten

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:42,800
really big the work you need to do and

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:48,889
to be successful it's gotten really big

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:51,650
and really complicated for those of you

00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:55,430
that are CIOs you're thinking how do I

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,830
do more with what I have be innovative

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,970
and keep an eye to where the future is

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:04,970
all while saving money if you're an

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,800
operator or an architect you're thinking

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,980
about how do I build the infrastructure

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,910
that supports my future needs and helps

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,470
me get to where I need to go and for the

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,350
developers you're the ones that are

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,940
changing your company's future you're

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,919
the ones that are developing the new

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:27,919
applications that are going to allow

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:29,900
your organization's to be competitive so

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,120
each and every one of your jobs have

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:39,350
gotten harder but what if we could make

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:45,020
it easier imagine what we could all

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:46,789
collectively solve together and that's

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,150
something we talk a lot about with cloud

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:52,880
foundry but it really remains true for

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,590
open-source collectively the

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,669
capabilities that we can bring to bear

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:04,880
around cloud are way more powerful

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:06,289
through open source now for those of you

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
that aren't familiar with cloud foundry

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,870
we're an open source platform as a

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,880
service and I spend a lot of time

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,430
talking about the architecture and the

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,479
technology and how it all works together

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:22,610
and the value it brings but ultimately

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,260
what I'm really talking about for the

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,419
organizations that are using it is

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:32,390
digital transformation the ability for

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:37,220
your organizations to become software

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:39,260
companies to write develop code and get

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,860
it into production as quickly as

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:47,270
possible

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:50,600
and that's any code and on any cloud and

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,210
for each of you you're constantly trying

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,970
to figure out how do I become more

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:59,060
responsive to my customers and their

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,990
needs are changing how do I innovate

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:06,380
more and ultimately how can I fell

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,530
faster how can I get new ideas out into

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:13,370
the market and iterate on those ideas

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:16,040
over and over again that's really where

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,530
the power of cloud is enabling us to do

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:25,400
each and every one of those at a much

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:28,190
bigger scale and faster but what does

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,960
the future look like if you're thinking

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,890
about what is that investment look like

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:39,580
and how does it manifest I've got a

00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:42,200
couple of examples through Volkswagen a

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,620
car company is no longer just a car

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:49,160
company in fact a car no longer just

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:52,910
gets you from point A to point B it's a

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:56,600
connected mobile device it's full of

00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:58,210
sensors and data and the automotive

00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:04,580
industry is changing and changing

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:06,350
quickly for Volkswagen they realized

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,590
they needed to build out a development

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,630
team they didn't have in-house they

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,790
needed to develop applications that

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:17,810
could take advantage of not just one

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:21,760
cloud but many clouds and they needed to

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,530
do that across 12 different brands and

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,050
they've invested in cloud foundry and

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,880
cloud native technologies to help them

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,160
do that

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,270
because at the end of the day it's about

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,310
the applications that extend that car

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:40,310
through mobile apps supply chain

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:43,940
management all of that pulled together

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:48,890
to bring a single concise experience for

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,520
the automotive industry or one of my

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,310
favorites

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,139
is the US Air Force the military

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,629
now when you think about the military

00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:59,449
you don't necessarily think of agile or

00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:04,459
fast moving or even bleeding edge

00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:09,410
technology the Air Force had a massive

00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:12,319
technology budget but yet 70% of that

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:16,490
budget was going to just maintaining the

00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:22,009
existing infrastructure only 30% was

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:26,149
going to new R&D and new software for

00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:29,360
the Air Force they implemented agile

00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:31,910
practices and started taking advantage

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,339
of the cloud and started developing

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,459
applications to run in a cloud and

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:40,629
they'll multiple clouds and for them

00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:43,339
these small changes allowed them to

00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:45,559
change the way they allocated their time

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,050
and money they were able to get

00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,959
applications out the door and weeks and

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,639
months instead of years and they were

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,370
able to switch that spend in that

00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:59,540
investment so that 70% of their budget

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,279
now goes to R&D and 30% goes to

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,660
maintaining the existing infrastructure

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:09,139
and in the process they also saved 600

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,899
million US dollars in one year so for

00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:16,779
them it represented the ability to move

00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:16,779
quickly but also to save time and money

00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:26,689
or Home Depot a brick and mortar that

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,610
actually sells brick and mortar for them

00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:31,339
as part of the retail industry they were

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:37,160
being disrupted by some of the biggest

00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:41,389
e-commerce sites for a company like Home

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,220
Depot that helps homeowners do work they

00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,769
were actually being disrupted by Amazon

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:49,879
who sold more hammers than they did in

00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:53,480
one year and they needed to figure out

00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:56,689
how to compete in a space on the cloud

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,279
with cloud native applications and how

00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:02,329
to iterate and develop those

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,190
applications quickly and so they

00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,889
invested in a platform

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,699
and made that shift to continuous

00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:13,279
delivery and were able to move thousands

00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:16,459
of applications to both public and

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,550
private clouds and allow them to iterate

00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:22,430
on those applications quickly in fact

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,519
Home Depot went from spending six weeks

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,139
to develop one app and get it into

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,889
production - now they deployed a

00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:33,350
production every 15 minutes so they are

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:35,600
constantly developing new applications

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,230
and constantly deploying those in

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,050
production it's so when I think about

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,180
the power of the cloud power of

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,579
platforms like Cloud Foundry or even

00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,949
cloud native architectures what does

00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:52,639
that actually mean it means ability for

00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:56,379
you to create new ideas and get them

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,379
into production as quickly as possible

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:02,959
but one of the most exciting things

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,660
about Cloud Foundry or even every

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,230
project talked about here at lc3 is that

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,439
it's open source open source provides an

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:15,550
opportunity for us to all collectively

00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:19,279
work together brings together diverse

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:24,199
minds diverse organizations diverse

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:29,500
people to drive real innovations that

00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:33,680
what's makes open source so powerful and

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:37,490
the Linux Foundation is home to every

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,490
major cloud native technology with

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,769
projects like Cloud Foundry cloud native

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,009
computing foundation and open container

00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:49,490
initiative we're excited to be part of

00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:52,550
an open source movement a movement

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,649
that's allowing developers like you to

00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,899
create applications in the cloud and

00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:03,470
take advantage of these cloud native

00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:07,160
technologies so today I'd like to leave

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,949
you with a couple of asks contribute to

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,110
the project get involved in the open

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:14,440
source community and be part of that

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:20,620
bring your ideas to that's

00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:22,600
Abell get training get certified take

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,180
training learn how to develop cloud

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,120
native applications how to run cloud

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,630
native platforms and how to be part of

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,630
this shift

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:44,040
and finally join a community have your

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:48,060
voices be heard be part of the

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,130
conversation be a member and be part of

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,490
it because there's a ton of opportunity

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,530
that exists in open-source in each and

00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:01,200
every one of you bring that opportunity

00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:03,830
to China so today I leave you with the

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,450
choices in your hands to have control

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,760
control over how you spend your time and

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:13,640
control over how you invest in the

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,640
