[Music]

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,840
hello my name is corey hulin i'm

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,040
co-founder and cto of mattermost and i'm

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,759
going to be giving a talk

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,079
about working effectively in remote

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,640
environments

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,079
so a little history or story real quick

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,759
mattermost is a

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,600
fully remote company we've been fully

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,000
remote since our inception

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,840
so we've been operating in this sort of

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,799
environment for the last

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
five or six years

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,000
so let's before we can really talk about

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,200
effective work

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,440
uh maybe we should talk about some of

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,440
the sort of benefits and drawbacks

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,879
uh so what are the benefits of fully

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,879
revo remote development

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,680
some of the benefits that we find are

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,120
now you have that sort of

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,000
quality deep work time that that

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,519
quality time where you're just you know

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,480
you have a lot of focused time where you

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,760
can work

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,040
you can do whatever you set to achieve

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,800
you don't have a whole lot of external

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
interruptions

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,480
and we find that's probably one of its

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,239
biggest advantages

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,000
the other the other advantage is sort of

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,040
that asynchronous nature

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,599
right you have less interruptions you

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,160
have

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
less people coming by your office or

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,920
your cubicle or less

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,920
distractions out there as well so just

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
the ability to really focus and that

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,040
asynchronous ability which causes you

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,640
know a lot less interruptions

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,319
we as a company also find this to be

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
advantage because there's you know a

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,360
vast

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,120
sea of resources out there uh in terms

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,959
of people who want to work for

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
remote style companies now i know in the

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,879
age of coverage and we'll kind of talk

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,319
about the differences that we see

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,680
i mean that may change for the future

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,200
and i think that would be awesome if it

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,720
does happen

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,360
you know i think remote work is

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,959
definitely a benefit for all

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
you know the other big benefit is it

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
saves things like you know commute time

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,319
or drive time

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
so you have either more hours to spend

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,760
with your family or do other stuff

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,239
or whatever it is more focused time

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,519
so we we find that as a company you know

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,360
having that ability to

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
to have access to a lot of that that

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
vast sea of resources is really

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,959
important

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
and then what it ends up attracting is

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,840
people who are sort of very mission

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,959
driven right

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,159
um most sort of fundamentally believe in

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,040
the work that they're doing

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,560
um i always kind of break it down into

00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,680
to be successful in our own

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,280
environment we'll kind of get into these

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
two things but you have to be there's

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,000
kind of two things

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,159
one is you have to be really good at

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,480
asynchronous written form communication

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,439
we'll talk about that so that's one and

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
then two is

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,680
you have to be internally motivated

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
right there's no external peer pressure

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,680
there's

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,359
no there's no peers sitting next to you

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,759
uh there's no external boss hovering

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,079
over you right so what we what we find

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,440
is

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,800
you know we fundamentally find people

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,840
that sort of believe in this work

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,479
believe in the nature of what we're

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,320
doing

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,840
the other interesting benefit you know

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,199
pre-covet at least was you could be a

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,600
digital nomad

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,199
um i was kind of the poster child for

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,919
that for a number of years

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,199
so i spent two summers in alaska and two

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,120
winters in florida

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,479
and kind of everywhere else in between

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
so as long as you have a good internet

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,440
connection

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,080
um you know it's you could you could

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,520
work from anywhere being being in

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,080
a knowledge worker in a remote

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,720
environment so i know those may not be

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,320
familiar with

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,320
you know american geography whatever but

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,240
you know alaska and florida are about as

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,919
far apart as you can get

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,479
and then still drive a car in between

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,759
them um um you know so it's i don't know

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,560
what it is probably three four thousand

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,479
miles apart

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,840
um several thousand kilometers um so

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,600
um and i kind of spent everywhere in

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,800
between and so you know it's being

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
remote is one of those

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,840
uh lifestyles that you could have um

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,240
and it gives you a lot of i think at

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,000
least sort of mental health right

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,600
you know if you're often doing a bunch

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,639
of different fun stuff

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
you know that those are actually

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,880
pictures of me carter sort of all all

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,080
over

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,600
um we have a what we call matter mug um

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,600
so it's a mug that we give to our

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
community members our people

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,039
participate in matter most open source

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,479
project and i just like to take pictures

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,479
with it in strange locations

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
um so what are some of the drawbacks of

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
being full remote i mean there

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,000
definitely are drawbacks

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,240
um i'd say the the

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
probably one of the biggest ones is what

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,720
i like to call virtual doors

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,319
knocking on virtual doors um it's really

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,759
hard to do like if you think of yourself

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
being in an office

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,680
in a physical office and somebody has a

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,080
shut door it's really hard in that

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
physical

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,199
office to go knock on that door

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
interrupt somebody say hey i want to

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,759
spend some time

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,600
let's talk about x y and z it's even

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,520
harder when you talk about a virtual

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
door right

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,039
so that's one of those things that we

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
try uh really hard with

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,280
certain tools and techniques to sort of

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
um get past but it's definitely it's

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,400
definitely a drawback right

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,360
um you know the other one that's sort of

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,639
one of those ones you don't really think

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,680
about is you know who's in the office

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
right it's really easy to see

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,039
when you show up to a physical office

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,560
who's in and who's not and you get a

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,680
sense right away that you know when you

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,280
whether you go to lunch or whether you

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
do stuff like oh you know

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
joe or sally must be out on vacation

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,039
because they're not here this week or

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
whatever

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,680
so it's one of those things that you

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,199
kind of miss when you go to a fully

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,039
remote environment it's just

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,599
that really easy way to detect you know

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,560
who's in and who's out

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,639
and last thing you know one of the

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,319
biggest drawbacks i would say is you

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,800
know everything kind of turns into

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,919
this need for a scheduled meeting when

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,280
you remote

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,039
and that that's something that we try

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
really hard to defend against

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,599
but and we understand it's you know it's

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,880
part of the process it's part of being

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,560
remote

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,960
but you do have this sort of you know

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,319
everything kind of turns into this

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,319
schedule meeting need or whatever

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,080
the other big drawback you know

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,759
especially in the this time of covid is

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,880
just that sort of

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,880
missing you know human face-to-face time

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,160
i'll you know we we as a company like i

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
said we were remote we've been remote

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
since our inception

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
uh you know we as a company have always

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
struggled with this right and i would

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,599
say more so now postcoded

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,199
and we can get into the reasons why but

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
we at the very least as a company and

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,319
here's some pictures from our previous

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,000
what we call matter cons

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,080
we at very least as a company and a

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,680
community an open source community

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,360
we used to get together at least once a

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,879
year at matacon so we would actually fly

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
in all of our staff members

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,280
fly in a bunch of our community members

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,199
and just just have a big meet up

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,400
at least once a year uh the featured

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
teams would actually get together more

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,840
than once a year some of the feature

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,680
teams got together several times a year

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,599
and this is just a great way to sort of

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120
to build trust to sort of

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,199
you know get rid of that human element

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,120
to see people face to face like there is

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,960
some you know you do have to recognize

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,199
there is some need for that even for us

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,639
right um you know during code we kind of

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,280
shut down all of our meetups and stuff

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,560
like that so

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,919
that's even been challenging for us

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,039
right so we do a lot of other kind of

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,199
activities

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,400
um and it's it's not the same it's it's

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
a good sort of

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,160
supplement um but even we recognize that

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
this is one of those things that we're

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,080
at least i'm hoping you know after covid

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,599
that we can get back to doing because

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
there really is that need for that human

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
face to face time

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,880
um so we kind of talk about benefits and

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,760
drawbacks let's really quickly talk

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,680
about

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,839
what does effective communication look

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,839
like especially when you're remote

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,000
you know good communication you need to

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,959
be an organization that values

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,560
asynchronous communication or an open

00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,880
source community we're actually both

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,399
we're

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
we're a company and we're also an open

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,160
source community you so you need to be

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,519
really good at that sort of

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,600
asynchronous written form of

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,800
communication about

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,040
writing everything down and so we

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,959
strive really hard as an open source

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,040
community and as a company

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,560
to really be open and to be open to

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,440
writing everything down especially for

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
us because

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
we deal with people all over the world

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
in all time zones

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
because of our open source nature and so

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,640
the only way that you can always get

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,880
sort of you know conceptually everybody

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,720
in the same room is by taking a copious

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,399
amount of notes

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,000
and writing those notes down in some

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,440
sort of you know persistent chat system

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,680
we're also really good at ephemeral

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
video um

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,160
it's one of those things that we

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,360
recognize you know video is a great form

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,560
of communication we'll kind of go into

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,320
that a little bit

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
but you know being really good at sort

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,680
of dropping into ephemeral video

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,120
taking notes and dropping back out you

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,800
need to write everything down

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,880
i kind of talked about that you need to

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,399
be anti-meeting

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,399
this is hard like we struggle with this

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,920
as a community in a company

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,519
but we're very conscious about when

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,200
we're adding meetings we try really hard

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,160
to go through and remove meetings

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
i mean you're definitely going to have

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,959
meetings it's this uh you know that's

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
just the name of the game

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,000
but you have to remember that in in a

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,040
remote world

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
um um you know everything kind of needs

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,760
to be scheduled right

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
everything needs to have a meeting start

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
time and time and there there's not this

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,760
serendipitous

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,160
sort of meeting together um but it's

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,880
you know it it's it's uh you just need

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,959
to be

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,880
sort of aware and try to limit those

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,399
types of try to be very

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,959
understanding and limiting in terms of

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,880
what meetings you're adding um

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,240
the last is simulated water cooler time

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,519
so this is probably one of the questions

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,440
that comes up the most was like ah

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,519
corey like how do you guys do

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,959
brainstorming and we do do brainstorming

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,880
we have very much

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
sort of that ad hoc hangout together

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,120
time and the difference is

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,880
is it's just the scheduling of it is

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,880
just forced like the

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,640
the event itself is very serendipitous

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,000
we talk about different stuff

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,920
we do it a lot of different ways here at

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
matamos most of these ways we always

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,120
invite the community so we sit together

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,839
with the community and the company

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,839
together

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,360
and we do these different things they

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,800
range they go all the way from things

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,560
like tech moon shots where we kind of

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
just sit around and discuss

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,640
what we think we'd like to do you know

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,200
architecturally and then for the future

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,920
all the way down to things like dev

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,040
hangouts um so we have a weekly

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,120
audio only chat where people can

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,399
go into the hangout they can just hang

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,640
out um

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
chat talk about tech program while

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,120
you're sitting there listen other people

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
talk about tech it's just a great way to

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,839
build connections so

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
i would say like we still have those

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,560
serendipitous water cooler meetings but

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,120
but they're very scheduled or structured

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,279
right and

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,399
and and the other example is you know

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,079
people talk about what about

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,519
brainstorming in the office and i'm

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,200
i'm like yeah we do the exact same thing

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,000
we schedule brainstorming sessions and

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,760
we just have

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,040
i'd say the big difference is ours is

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,200
probably more effective

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,480
um it's a little weird to get set up

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,839
it's a little weird to get used to but i

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,000
would say ours are a lot more effective

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,920
because we're really once we remember

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
because of our environment we're really

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,360
good at being

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,720
asynchronous communicators and really

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
good at taking notes

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,760
so the classic example is if you're in a

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
you know if you're in the building

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
and you're having a brainstorming

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,760
session you go into an office everyone

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
white's on a whiteboard

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,360
and that whiteboard is a free flow of

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,560
ideas it's some stuff over here and some

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
stuff over there and some stuff over

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
there

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,320
and use the outcome of that at least in

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
my previous lives as you go there with

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,639
your fam

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,560
your camera on your phone you take a

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,120
picture of it you send it to everybody

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,880
you know over email or whatever and

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
that's how you document the event

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,720
and when you think about when you think

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,399
about that's a really poor way to do it

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,839
so what we're really good about is

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,440
creating something like a document that

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,200
goes along with that session where we're

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
kind of keeping track and somebody's you

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,519
know taking copious notes and so you end

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
up

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,120
at the end of that session with a really

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,160
amazing sort of brainstorm

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,160
brainstorming document

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,360
so next let's talk about you know what

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,200
tools um

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,880
should i use for effective communication

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
in a remote environment

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
um and we'll kind of go through some of

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,560
these different tools

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,959
um i think first and foremost the most

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,600
overlooked one is just the home office

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
set up

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,760
um you know you need to be i i and

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,680
especially i think you know

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,519
because of things like covid people you

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
know you just sort of went to the office

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,320
one day and the next day you started

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,720
working from home

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
and that could be really hard um if you

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,240
don't have the right setup right and

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,720
whatever that setup is for you like so

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
if you're a company with staff members

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
you know we really encourage you to make

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
sure your staff are set up correctly

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,399
they have

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,079
whatever it is that they need the right

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,200
video uh the white

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,160
camcorder or sorry webcam the right

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,279
you know headset uh office chair desk

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,040
whatever it is like

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,639
invest a little bit in that and getting

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,120
that set up for your staff members

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,959
of course you know i'm biased so um the

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,920
next is having a channel based

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,079
collaboration

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,440
sort of persistent chat i think that's

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,720
probably one of the biggest ones in

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
terms of this remote

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
sort of collaboration and being

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,199
effective once again i'm super biased

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,199
like you know

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,920
founded matter most on this premise of

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,040
like i think channel-based or

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,680
topic-based communication

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,120
is is really important uh that's what

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,480
mattermost does so if you're not

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,160
familiar with mattermost it's uh you

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,440
know it's an open source alternative to

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,399
slack it's probably the best way to

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
describe it

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,519
um and at matter most we use matter most

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,920
we use it you know hourly daily

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,360
um we run our entire company and we run

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,480
our entire community so we have a

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
community server

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,360
that has nine thousand plus community

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,959
members on it i think we're getting

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,399
close to ten thousand now

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,079
several hundred staff members sit there

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,079
and that is how we run

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,279
our open source project and that is how

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,880
we run our

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,720
community um and it kind of boils down

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,720
to like one very simple thing like

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,399
channel based or topic based chat so

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
that's kind of important it needs to be

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
persisted it needs to be half history it

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,160
needs to be channel based or topic based

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,680
uh i truly believe you know when you

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,519
think about things like channel based

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,120
i truly believe something like email is

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,360
the best for

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
external communication communicating

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,720
outside of your company

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,720
but chat or channel based is the best

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,279
for internal communication

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,399
and it's for a few very simple key

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
reasons but

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,639
email is inherently private in the sense

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,680
that that information is siloed in

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,160
my inbox in my email so that's kind of

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
one

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,360
big strike against it it's just that

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,240
private nature of email when you're

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,079
talking about wanting to be

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,560
collaborative within let's say a company

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,480
or

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,399
a community and and channel based or

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,240
topic based chat is very

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,839
open right if you have access to the

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,160
channel you have access to

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,279
all of that shared knowledge and anybody

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,959
can be added

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,320
you know to a channel in the middle of

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
it and get access to all that shared

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
knowledge

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,880
so that ability to search for that

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,560
history is really amazing

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,560
and you have that async nature right

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,839
that ability to go asynchronous

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,759
chat is really interesting because it's

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,360
one of the few tools you can actually do

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,720
both and we do do both

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,160
when we're talking about channels or

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
things publicly or interacting with

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,519
community members that we know

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,199
sit in very different time zones we have

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,720
a very asynchronous mindset

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,079
right we're going to send somebody a

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,199
message and we know they're not going to

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,399
get it till tomorrow and we're not

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,920
expecting a response

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,360
one of the cool things about persistent

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,480
chat though is you can drop into this

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,279
synchronous mode right where you're

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
having a

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,560
let's say a direct message conversation

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,120
with somebody and you're just literally

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,199
chatting back and forth in real time

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,560
um so it really gives you that one that

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,320
advantage as well

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,839
uh and lastly what i'd like to say is

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,279
sort of you know we call it integrations

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,800
and bots for central command however you

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,000
want to describe it

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,720
but it's the ability to take structured

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,959
data

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,120
so this is data coming from things like

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,040
integrations and analytic tools

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,480
and let's say logging tools whatever it

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
is and that's piping structured

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,240
information into a channel

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,399
and then having unstructured information

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,160
or information coming from humans

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,920
augmenting that information in a channel

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,279
so the best is talk about an example

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
right when you talk let's say incident

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,680
response

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,839
you're having an outage at your company

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,000
or your whatever service is going down

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,680
there's no better way to to act

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
especially as or even as a non-remote

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,360
company but especially as a remote

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
company

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,040
where you're kind of getting everything

00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,519
in the right sort of topic at the right

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
time

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,560
so you're getting automated stuff

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
pumping messages into that room where

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
you where

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,919
humans are sort of doing the analysis

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
and investigating what's going on with

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,880
the outage

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,880
and having people respond there in real

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,919
time and being able to hand off that

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,520
event like hey i'm

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,039
you know it's my night time i'm ready to

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,559
sign out at someone else's

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,319
you know on-call schedule she's going to

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,679
come over and take over this event

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,360
and they can automatically join the

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,120
channel and see all of that stream of

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,880
confidence that shared history

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,240
that shared command line that is a super

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,520
powerful concept when you're talking

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,160
about sort of channel based

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,200
collaboration so you know for like i

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,120
said i'm biased

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,720
you know coming from mattermost but we

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,400
believe you know channel-based or

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,360
topic-based communication is one of the

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,200
keys

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,880
uh to running a sort of fully remote

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,840
remote team

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,440
the second most important pillar uh in

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,240
sort of remote collaboration

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,440
is ephemeral video i think it's one of

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,919
those things you have to really be good

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,600
at i mean

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,480
i know people you know tamakovic people

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,840
have already gone to it and they're

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
holding meetings there and stuff like

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
that but

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,039
i think there's a few key differences of

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,760
course when you're having meetings

00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,960
you're having

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
a femoral video when you're having

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,559
one-on-ones you're doing it through

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,640
video so video has a lot of implications

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,799
especially a femoral video

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,559
that make communication really easy and

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,840
we have a lot of ephemeral video

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,280
the key once again is being very good at

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,120
taking copious notes

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
and taking those notes and posting them

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,919
back into a channel

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
especially when you're having a sort of

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
brainstorming session or whatever it is

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,120
so let me describe a scenario to you

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,480
where we're really good as a community

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,960
and company in the sense of

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,960
you know you you can see those

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,600
conversations in matter most devolving

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,200
right they

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,039
there's some there's some conversation

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
that's you know 50 replies deep on this

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,280
thread

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,480
and you can tell people are

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
communicating on that thread they're

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,960
just sort of

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,240
they're not they're kind of talking past

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,679
each other they're not then people

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,480
aren't understanding each other's point

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,080
of view

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
right and you'll see you'll see in our

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,640
in our community it's really interesting

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,919
you'll see someone like hey let's just

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,520
hop on a call

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,840
like all right and so they'll they'll go

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,120
over to do a jitsu video or something

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,400
like that and they'll sit in that jitsi

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,840
video for

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,440
they'll bring up that ephemeral video

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,039
and they'll they'll talk and

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,960
the reason they do that is because you

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,320
know the picture you know

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,760
a picture's worth a thousand words right

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,440
it's a lot more efficient to communicate

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,320
it's a lot more efficient to understand

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,240
people's

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
opinions or sides of the argument and

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,440
there's the little nuances that you get

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,640
in video right which is really important

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
it's key to sort of that human

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,280
interaction which is you can it's easier

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,799
to tell when somebody you know

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,720
the written form of the word versus the

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,919
spoken form of the world it's word it

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,440
can be really hard to tell when

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,080
somebody's joking

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,280
um you know or or someone you know said

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
that in jasper

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,280
or um you know so it can be really hard

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,039
to pick those things up sometimes but

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,799
it's really easy

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,000
when you talk about it and are a lot

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,520
easier at least when you talk about it

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,200
in terms of seeing somebody's expression

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
and how they're responding and seeing

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
either like oh that person is totally

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,200
relaxed and joking i thought they were

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
upset

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,240
um and that you know that's one of those

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
things that comes across a lot easier in

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
video so

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,640
you'll see lots of times the

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,720
conversation in in chat will devolve

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,559
um delhi the group will immediately join

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,200
a video they'll hash it out and the key

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,400
here is

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,320
while they're hashing it out they're

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
taking copious notes and they'll post

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,760
that information back into the channel

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,880
here's the outcome right because one of

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,559
the things that you realize especially

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,840
as an open source community but but as a

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,280
company it goes fully remote now it's a

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,640
lot harder in the sense that

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,360
you know there's always going to be

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,720
somebody out there there's always going

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,760
to be somebody whatever is it

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,280
you know sick or on vacation um or

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,640
in our case that you know an open source

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,760
community member who might be asleep in

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,039
the middle of the night right

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,159
and you want to share with them the

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,280
details of the outcome of that

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,480
conversation there's nothing more

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,919
frustrating than

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,679
seeing a conversation seeing it got

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,840
moved into some video chat

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,720
and then there's no summary of it posted

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,679
back in the channel like

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,120
wait a minute there was something

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,159
important discussed there what was the

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,080
outcome right

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,280
and you you want that asynchronous

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
nature

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,280
and then that's really kind of key to

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,360
this this ephemeral video piece

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,880
is sort of being able to drop into those

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,440
those conversations

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,000
take copious notes and then post it back

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,000
in the channel

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,720
uh next we'll talk about um

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,240
shared documents so i think this is sort

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,799
of the last and

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,600
third major pillar i would say um you

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,120
really need a

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,480
a ability to share documents um

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,720
so whether this be something like you

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
know an open source one like clobber

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,600
online

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,600
or something like google docs um you

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,799
really need to you really need

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,240
um a a document system that kind of

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,679
captures that structure

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,280
and you'll see us do this all the time

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,200
in matamus so we're really good at using

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,039
persistent chat for things like async

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,799
even things like sync conversations

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,360
are really good for using ephemeral

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,679
video for for discussing stuff and we're

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,360
really good at using sort of documents

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,200
shared documents for things like

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,240
capturing structure and long-lived

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,919
documents

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
and they're kind of it's very subtle in

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,559
terms of when you think about when you

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,159
use each of these tools but it's very

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,880
meaningful and impactful in terms of how

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,559
you do it

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,400
right you really want that long-lived

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,360
document you really want that document

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,880
that gives you some really good

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,840
structure that you can go back to

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,000
you can share outside of let's say your

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,080
channel or video that you're working on

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,960
um and so just just having and like i

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,320
said this one's you know it's one of

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,520
those ones kind of obvious like wow cory

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,400
everyone uses you know some sort of

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,840
shared document

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,520
yeah they do but they don't they don't

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,480
necessarily create a shared document for

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,400
everything right

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
so and i'm not suggesting that but i'm

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,960
suggesting like create

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,080
more shared documents than you think

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,919
right so the best best example is

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,919
we can create shared documents for even

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,000
meetings so we have a shared document

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,720
where we run our weekly recurring r d

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,799
meeting

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
and we just go in there and put the

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,360
agenda in there people can go and put

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,360
comments

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,720
people can come in and and say like hey

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,799
i want a demo this week and

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,400
then we have like a running history in

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,720
that shared document

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
of what happened in a very structured

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,280
way right and so that that's just kind

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
of one small way

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,679
and so you know most people use

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,840
documents for things like you know

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,360
producing let's say specs or design docs

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
like yes definitely you share documents

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,159
in that

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,520
and we do too and those are still great

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,159
linking those in the channels and stuff

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,240
like that

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,840
but we also use a lot of shared docs for

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,320
like i said things like meetings

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,440
specific meetings um we also use a lot

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,360
of shared docs for things like

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,880
one-on-one right one-on-ones with your

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,159
manager right so you can go in and you

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,840
have this running shared dock of

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,320
one-on-one stuff

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,919
that you can both add to and like i said

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,360
it it's it's maybe it's an obvious thing

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,280
but it's one of those things that's not

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,600
so obvious in terms of you know using

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,360
that kind of tool more because that

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,720
structured document that long-lived

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,720
document

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,159
gives you something different from you

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,520
know persistent chat it gives you

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,600
something different from ephemeral video

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,120
yeah so how can you reach thank you how

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,720
can you reach me

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,880
the best way to reach me is probably on

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,039
our community server

00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,120
community.mattermost.com

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,480
you can just add message to me at corey

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,720
you can always use email

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,400
corey hewland or my personal email i'm

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,480

from my personal corey healing.com

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
or on twitter so those are the best ways

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,000
to reach me but i would love to hear

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,520
from you i would love to

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,880
hear what are some of the things that

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
you struggle with what are some of the

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
things

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,400
that because like i said we don't have i

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,679
know you know we don't have all the

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
answers to all this like we

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,039
constantly trying to we've been doing

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,200
this for five six years now we're

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,480
constantly trying to improve

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,640
so if you could share with me your

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,200
thoughts and processes and and

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,760
experiences like i would that would be

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,880
awesome

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:04,480

thank you very much thank you corey

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,159
our next keynote speaker is adam

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:15,760
gibbet adam works on connected vehicle

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,279
and project engineering at canoe

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,320
a company that is innovating on the idea

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,880
of what it means to have an electric

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,000
vehicle

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,880
in the city today

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,840
adam will discuss the symbiotic

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,520
innovation

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:37,840
of using open source at startups

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,840
please welcome adam keep it

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,159
good morning good evening uh since this

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,679
is a virtual conference i'm not quite

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,240
sure what time it is for everybody

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,720
uh but welcome uh today i'll be going

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,120
through

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,520
uh symbiotic innovation open source for

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,919
startups

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,840
it's kind of set the tone for the the

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,000
discussion

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,080
give a quote from guy kawasaki ideas are

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,320
easy implementation is hard

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,159
i think this quote really captures it

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,360
captures the problem statement and some

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,320
of the troubles that

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,559
that stripes tend to tend to go through

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,559
in terms of the agenda uh i'll give a

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,520
quick introduction of myself and and

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,640
canoe

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,320
i will talk about what makes a startup

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,919
hard what are some of the problems that

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,600
that a startup has to go through on a

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,919
daily basis

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,039
dive into those problems and discuss

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,760
what opens off

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,559
open source software uh helps uh

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,960
provides in

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,919
to help solve those problems and we'll

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,880
talk about

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,520
what startups do to provide uh to

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,840
provide

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
back to the open source uh projects or

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,640
open source software

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,600
uh to create that cycle of uh synthetic

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,039
innovation

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,520
um and then we'll give some final

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,200
thoughts uh and uh conclusions and

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,080
and what are the what are the next steps

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
and where do we go from here

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,960
engineering groups uh

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,880
and canoe is an eevee ev company that

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,440
launched in 2018

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,640
we reached beta in 19 months and we've

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,200
along the way we've developed this

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,159
highly

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,279
modular skateboard uh platform

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,120
containing all the components of

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,960
electronic powertrain and and

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,840
the the areas where i i

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,960
work in the connected vehicle area we

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,679
have used

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,440
we have used open source projects and

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,080
automotive grade linux

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,080
to create to create our unique user

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
experience

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,159
so what makes a startup part well the

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,840
first

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,000
the first problem or the first challenge

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,039
to talk about is crazy timelines

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
uh it speed to market is is

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,039
is often a big thing for for startups

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,360
trying to hit

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,120
uh trying to hit a window of viability

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,919
for a product or trying to trying to get

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,200
things out

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,200
uh before a competitor

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,240
gets there it gets their product on the

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,880
market is is

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,279
is usually very critical for for startup

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,799
um

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,960
in addition going through product

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,200
iterations and proof of concepts

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,360
uh and really kind of going through this

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,480
to to resolve the product goals

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,240
to understand precisely to refine that

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,600
product into something that that is

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,320
is saleable and and useful um

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,880
proof concepts help to to kind of settle

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,559
these

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,640
you know slowly settle these differences

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,279
and provide provide feedback to this

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,840
process

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,600
and they also are very useful for

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,720
providing demonstrations to potential

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,720
investors or customers

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,120
uh the next the next challenge is

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,000
financial management

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,200
uh every startup has to be has to be

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
cost conscious

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,960
uh they they don't always have an income

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,000
source

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,320
they're they're kind of on a a limited

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,840
uh limited budget um and so so

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,520
understanding precisely

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,279
uh what what you're getting before

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,600
committing to it so you

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,320
uh you tend to try try a lot of things

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,720
before

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,240
committing resources or committing uh

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,840
funds to something

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,880
um and and understanding you know

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,320
when to spend the money so when when

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,679
exactly do you need to spend the money

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,200
not always you need to spend

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,200
everything at the beginning of the

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,399
program

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,080
but obviously after you know too late in

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,240
the program can be a problem so

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,760
understanding exactly know exactly when

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,600
to spend the money is important

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,200
um and then knowing the full cost of

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,000
commercialization how much will it take

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
for you to

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,520
to create uh to take the the proof of

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,360
concept or the the

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,039
the product that you have currently um

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,760
and and put that into production and so

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,360
those are

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,640
those are some of the uh the challenges

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,640
in addition uh uh startups tend to run

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,840
skeleton crews they tend to have very

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,080
very small teams

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,039
um and and the teams are kept small for

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,159
a reason

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,080
uh there it's a lot easier to keep a

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,080
small team aligned and focused on a

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,840
singular goal

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,399
uh as teams grow it communication

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,000
and processes become necessary and and

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,559
they start stifling

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,520
uh start stifling innovation and start

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,039
stifling

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,360
uh the the uh productivity of of some of

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,000
its

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,480
higher performing members um and so you

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,039
know so

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,320
to to to kind of control this you have

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,279
to understand when

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,960
when you need team uh people to be added

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,000
to the program you need to find flexible

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,120
team members

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,919
uh and and really understand the the

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,279
needs

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,799
uh the the skill sets that you're

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,480
looking for at that given time

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,320
so how does how does open source

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,559
software help to solve these

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,440
well for crazy timelines open source

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,559
software

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,399
uh provides a starting point it provides

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,279
uh foundational components and other

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,360
building blocks that that are useful for

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,440
for getting off the ground uh sometimes

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,000
get just getting started is the hardest

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,159
part

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,440
of a project especially when you're

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,200
given a

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,559
blank sheet of paper which is which is

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,440
precisely the situation

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,760
you know you had we had here canoe um

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,720
and

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,600
and so just getting getting that uh that

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
little kick and

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,240
uh kick in the rear uh to get going is

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,679
is a an important uh important aspect of

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,760
open source software

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,840
and and open source projects like

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,799
ottoman of grade linux provide a great

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,600
great fun set of foundational components

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:03,200
to enable this uh

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,799
this type of building um

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,039
to kind of build on that open source

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,360
projects often provide reference designs

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,080
and

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,159
implementation so so you can take and

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,360
create a sample application

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,600
uh fairly quickly uh with uh with

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,399
many open source projects and so this

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,320
this helps

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:25,679
to pro to to uh

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,240
spur is for the the designs and and also

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,919
helps

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,679
to quickly build up proof of concepts

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,799
and as mentioned previously proof

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,720
concepts

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,519
are key to to to the design iterations

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,000
and providing

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,480
providing direct feedback to the to the

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,960
the product definition process

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,600
and and like automotive grade linux is

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,399
another

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,360
it also provides a lot of resources here

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,279
too

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,840
to allow you to quickly build and

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,519
install software

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,080
and and get things up and running and

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,200
and provide demonstration and

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,440
reference reference uh

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,640
it reference platforms that can allow

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,640
you to create those

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,880
uh really neat proof of concepts that

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,279
that are useful going forward

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,320
um and all of this you kind of combine

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,080
all of this

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,080
and it really provides a shorter path to

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,960
a demonstrable product

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,799
it allows it creates things that people

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,320
can interact with

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,519
and and creating creating real software

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,159
and providing real interactions uh

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,000
is it is always preferable over

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,679
powerpoint powerpoints

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,240
are great and they definitely serve a

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,039
purpose but if you have if you have

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,200
something to show

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,159
a demonstration or a real product

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,279
interactions

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,320
uh are always always a preferred

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,039
preferred method um and it really it

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,480
really gives you

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,240
the opportunity to test out your

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,120
theories um to understand what's good

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,880
and bad about your

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,360
uh about the the product that you're

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,360
developing

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,960
and so uh to kind of continue on this uh

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,559
if we look at

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,240
financial management so what uh

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,000
what is what does uh open source

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,679
software provide from from a financial

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,880
management perspective well

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,480
it the initial investment is fairly low

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,559
uh the uh it's you know when

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,000
you know the difference you know going

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,799
going for commercial software

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,159
versus open source offer um when when

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,960
you're going in front of the budget

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,559
meeting or

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,519
sourcing council um to to get

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,880
get resources to pay for project fees or

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,120
license fees or

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,120
uh you need this fee to get started fees

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,960
um it's often difficult to explain to

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,080
people that i just need this

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,799
right now just to get going it doesn't

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,039
really give us

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,279
any any working software it just gives

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,640
us the ability to develop on this

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,320
um that that always often uh creates

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,919
it creates some interesting

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,000
conversations and so if you have the

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,519
option to go with an open source project

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,720
um where the the the software is at

00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,600
uh you know at no cost or or

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,720
you know um and provides you provides

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,720
you similar

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,480
this similar ability to get started um

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,960
this is often

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,480
much more preferred um and then

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,399
maintenance

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,679
maintenance is one of those things that

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,639
often gets uh

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,839
put on the the column of uh it's it's a

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,200
it's a negative

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,079
but i i see maintenance as a as a

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,679
positive

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,079
um maintenance it can be can be kind of

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,760
scary uh because you know you're you're

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,760
picking up an open source project where

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,800
there's no support that they're there

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,000
there may not

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,520
may not be a support system um in place

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,879
um and and so uh

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,320
you're you're taking on a lot of

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,639
responsibility and a lot of risk and a

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,919
lot

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,919
uh and and so it can be quite

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,800
intimidating

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,599
um but the control that open source

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,639
projects

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,480
give you uh allows the startup to really

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,440
become a master of their own destiny

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,280
um by working with and understanding the

00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,680
open source project rather than fighting

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,200
it

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,440
uh the the skills within your

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,760
organization will grow um these skills

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
will

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,280
will then become an asset of the

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,720
organization and allow you to

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,760
in source and reduce outside

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,960
dependencies uh making forecasting

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,599
of like future support and maintenance

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
costs

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,960
uh more straightforward because they're

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,400
not dependent on on what a

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,079
another company uh will provide um

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,599
it's all it's all based on what your

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,720
what your capabilities are on

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,599
uh on within the company

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,440
um and then the last the last aspect of

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,800
financial management is obviously

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,960
uh it is is cost the

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,560
license and royalties that you you pay

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,119
often uh get attached to

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,720
the product final product cost um and

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,560
while these vendors deserve to

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,240
to ask for products that they've put in

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,880
put in hard work to create

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,599
um and not having these especially for a

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,359
startup

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,640
allows provides you significant

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,200
flexibility

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,240
to provide your products your end

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,359
products at

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,079
a at lower cost to your customers um and

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,839
it is really

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,520
it can be it can be seen as a way of

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,560
giving back and putting all of this

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,640
together it really

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,240
you know kind of ties the ties ties a

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,079
nice bow around

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,280
you know the path to commercialization

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,040
you you have

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,560
uh you understand what it's going to

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,680
take to maintain you understand what the

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,440
costs are going in

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,760
um and you understand what the initial

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,520
investment is um and so this makes it

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,160
much easier to to realize

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,640
uh to realize a production or

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,079
commercialization path

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,680
and so the last one for for team size

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,440
uh open source provides a community

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,119
uh there's always a word that you'll

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,440
worry that with open source you'll be

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,480
you'll be on your own um but i've kind

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,079
of found the opposite

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,200
uh forums mailing lists uh irc

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,839
irc channels uh all of these

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,560
provide an avenue a support channel uh

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,040
to to

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,920
to get to to ask questions and get some

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,720
feedback

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,119
um and so while it you know what some

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,839
some

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,119
people think you know it's it you you're

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,920
gonna have to solve all these problems

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,079
on your own

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,920
you won't have any support i you know

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,040
i've never felt like i was alone

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,040
there always seems to be a uh

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,960
a like-minded person out there who's

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,640
trying to solve a similar problem

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,480
who's more than happy to have uh to

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,560
provide a helping hand or even just

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,839
to just kind of talk through uh

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,839
potential solutions

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,680
um and then technical documentation

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,839
technical

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,839
technical documentation is always always

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,680
seen always seem to be a selling point

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,079
of commercial software

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,839
but now the communities behind open

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,720
source have made it

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,359
so commonplace to see good if not great

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,680
documentation associated with each

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,760
each project it has really

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,880
reduced the intimidation factor that

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,359
comes with taking

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,480
taking on software that you don't know

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,599
and it makes

00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,800
makes the integration of these projects

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,240
so much easier the fact that you can see

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,119
how the software works you can

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,400
understand you can understand

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,040
uh how like how it's intended to be used

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,359
and you can

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,640
you can read what are the what's the the

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,760
error cases and

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,520
and fail safe scenarios uh it

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,960
makes makes the the maturity of the

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,400
application that goes on top

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,400
uh significantly better um and then the

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,800
last the last aspect of this is is

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,920
a larger community really means there's

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,440
more people out there

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,119
in in the case where you actually do

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,240
want to hire people

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,359
um no longer do you have to uh to find

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,040
people with a

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,920
like an archaic or a very specific skill

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,960
set

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,440
uh a skill set or technology set

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,400
um you uh or or hope that they'll be

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,079
able to come in and pick up your

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,280
proprietary architecture

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:54,320
um you can rely on some open

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,680
uh open and standardized skills um and

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,160
it generally makes

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,359
makes finding people that can help your

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,400
help your company

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,480
out significantly easier and as i

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,320
mentioned like finding finding

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,280
the right skill set at the right time is

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,280
important for a startup

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,119
and so what do startups go ahead and

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,880
return

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,960
i talked about all the things that that

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,720
startups get out of this relationship

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,680
would have started to provide in return

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,240
startups can do things that the larger

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,040
companies

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,240
maybe can't uh and so they they can push

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,800
boundaries

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,720
uh they can push technology boundaries

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,599
user user experience boundaries product

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,599
boundaries

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,800
and and so what do i mean there the

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,720
technology boundaries

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,000
if you look at all of the uh ai and

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,920
autonomous startups

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,280
that are trying to push the the

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,720
boundaries of what's possible on

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,839
autonomous

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,400
uh autonomous vehicles uh

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,920
a lot of these pro a lot of these uh

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
companies a lot of these startups are

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,280
using

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,320
open source projects and so by using the

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,440
open source project

00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,400
the open source projects uh get

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,160
more uh get associated with it with the

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,160
successes of that of that startup

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,839
and and more people are are encouraged

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
to use those uh there's open source

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,800
projects

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,200
because of it uh startups can also push

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,520
the user experience boundaries

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,960
by uh by putting a different spin on the

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,359
same problem startups can

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,200
can can change change the conversation

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,040
around uh rounds user experience this is

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,560
an area where i think canoe

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,720
has has uh has can have some impact

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,000
uh as we're you know we're taking a

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,800
different spin on on

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,640
uh our user experience and and by using

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,599
uh automotive grade linux to power our

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,160
experience

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,520
uh it it shows it it provides an

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,440
alternative

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,119
example or alternative use case to an

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,920
already impressive

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:48,480
open source project and then finally

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,760
startups can push can push product

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,599
boundaries

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,599
tesla is a great example of this they've

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,640
pushed push boundaries on what

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,920
and on what the the product can do

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,119
uh from from from evs and traditional

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,440
automotive

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,240
uh and and and their tesla's reliance on

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,920
linux and open source technologies uh

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,040
kind of furthers that conversation and

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,040
shows that it's really possible

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,200
and then the startups can also

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,240
contribute to the community and this may

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,240
be a little bit the

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,079
the benefits here uh you know are

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,720
a little bit more obvious uh you know

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:32,240
with the startups being able to to

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,599
find bugs and and commit patches

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,760
commit fixes and patches uh you know as

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,880
as as more people use it it's obvious

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,720
that more people

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,720
more more developers will be able to

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,880
have a look at it and and kind of

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,960
create new features um and even create

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,000
new projects uh you know the canoe has

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,440
plans to to

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,760
to contribute back to the open source

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,680
community as well um

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,359
you know as our as a as our company

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,200
grows

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,720
um and then the last the last thing that

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,280
startups can provide in return is

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,119
startups can be open source advocates um

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,079
and a great example of this is what i'm

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,560
doing right now

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,240
presenting at an open source conference

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,960
being vocal supporters

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,760
of open source and and the the projects

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,839
uh that are

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,680
around it and provide provide great

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,880
examples of what's what is really

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,880
possible with open source

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,720
and so some final thoughts uh

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,800
so i you know kind of when i look at

00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,520
this i look at i look at how

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,880
startups and open source really are made

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,599
for each other they really need each

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,640
other

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,839
um they uh

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,680
startups startups definitely um get

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,760
uh get some benefits out of this they

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,280
get a head start by using open source

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,000
technology to kind of

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,400
jump start their product uh product uh

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,520
uh

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,119
development and and engineering efforts

00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:00,400
um open source uh open source software

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,319
uh open-source projects also get

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,079
benefits out of this association from

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,920
from kind of latching on to the

00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,520
successes of startups

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,440
um to to being being

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,200
accompanying the technology and

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,319
innovation changes that that that

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,880
surround them

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,280
um and and when you really when you

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,880
start putting these things together

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,400
uh you you can see how they it's this

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,960
snowball effect

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,440
of a symbiotic innovation um to where

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,839
both

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,640
both uh startups and open source uh

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,280
projects

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,640
um can really can really uh create

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,680
amazing things together

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,440
and and that that that innovation that

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,960
symbiotic innovation

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,800
that's created from these from this

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,680
relationship is really something we all

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,599
need

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,880
startups powered by open source can have

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,240
the ability to create

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,560
amazing products uh amazing services um

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,599
and amazing tools that not only create a

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,599
great user uh

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,280
great experiences for for users but also

00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,480
spur innovation

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,960
they this by by changing the the

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,319
changing the conversation on new

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,800
products and new ideas

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,240
um whether they're successful or not by

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,480
just uh changing

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,839
changing the thoughts of those around um

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,200
it helps generate those new

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,960
conversations

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,200
um and and and those conversations

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,000
uh really have an effect on on

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,800
innovation

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,440
on creating uh creating real innovation

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,640
around

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,880
uh you know uh as as things that were

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,680
deemed uh maybe not possible or not

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,319
likely

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,520
all of a sudden become uh become a real

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,280
possibility and and

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,720
open source has been essential to canoe

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,880
success and

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,760
it i i see great things coming from the

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,800
future

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,880
thank you very much and have a good day

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:49,760
thanks adam our next speaker today

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,400
sprung heading the licensing team that

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,079
elevated

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,560
open invasion network oim into the

00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,040
largest patent non-aggression community

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,640
in the history

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,800
establishing the leading the

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,400
professional network of open source

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,599
legal experts and aligning stakeholders

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,880
to launch

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:27,359
both the first law journal and the first

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:31,119
law book dedicated to open source

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,319
today shane will talk about open chain

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,880
not only as an industry standard but as

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,079
the first

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,800
ipo standard to come out from our

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,520
joint development foundation please

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,839
welcome

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,839
shane copeland

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,160
i'm shane cochlin and i'm the general

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,720
manager of the open chain project

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,800
i'm delighted to be here with you today

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,160
to talk about open chain

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,119
not only as an industry standard but as

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,000
the first standard to come out of our

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,640
joint development foundation

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,880
so let's start at the beginning open

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,040
chain has been in market since october

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,359
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,839
this industry standard has focused on

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,880
open source license compliance

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:25,920
in a short but effective specification

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,359
just seven pages long we've identified

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,440
the key requirements

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,800
of a quality open source compliance

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,359
program

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,160
now open chain might be a short industry

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,960
standard

00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,040
but it is a comprehensive one everything

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,839
that we have included in the open chain

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,640
standard

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,760
is based on real world experience from

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,800
user companies

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,720
out there now if you think about it we

00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,520
have around 25 years

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,560
of experience around open source some of

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,200
this experience

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,160
is based on deploying products some of

00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,200
this experience

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,440
is based on working with projects

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,079
one thing that has been consistent is

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,800
that in using open source licenses

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,160
everyone has been trying to optimize

00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,040
their work they've been trying to do

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,119
their best

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,599
to meet different requirements and to do

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,040
so in a timely manner

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,839
however trying to do it on your own

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,960
company by company is inherently

00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,280
inefficient

00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,720
especially when you consider the global

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,280
supply chain

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,280
the supply chain is made up of

00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,640
incredible amounts of companies

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,359
one product might go through 20 to 40

00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,400
companies

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,200
before hitting market chip makers board

00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,680
makers

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,000
people who make additional components

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,280
the people who provide drivers

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,040
it's a long supply chain if everyone is

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,640
doing their own thing with open source

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,319
license compliance

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,240
well first of all it's hard to predict

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,720
what your suppliers and your customers

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,760
are doing and what they need

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,160
it's also hard to predict what processes

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,839
are in the right place and solid enough

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,240
for your use cases

00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,640
the result is that in the past we have

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,880
seen license compliance challenges

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,400
on an individual company level perhaps

00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,559
it's about maturity

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,400
on a supply chain level it's really

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:20,000
about consistency

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,200
open chain well it identifies the

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,960
inflection points

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,400
where it's important to have a process

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,720
in place

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,240
it helps to contextualize how you deal

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,880
with inbound internal

00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,839
and outbound open source code whether

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,880
you're deploying it in a product or a

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:37,119
solution

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,000
we brought together hundreds of

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,240
companies

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,200
in drafting and initially deploying this

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,920
standard

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,839
it has been remarkably successful as a

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,400
de facto industry standard since october

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,640
2016.

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,559
we've seen a global community come to

00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,119
life and set up work groups in areas

00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,680
like automotive and tooling

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,599
equally important perhaps more important

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,960
we have seen very active

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:08,000
local communities form in china japan

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:10,960
korea taiwan india germany and the uk

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,480
companies user companies came together

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,559
to try to ensure

00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,000
that not only were the important process

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,640
points identified

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,359
but where appropriate knowledge was

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,640
shared

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,440
and recorded one good example is that we

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,920
have reference

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,839
training slides you don't have to use

00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,079
these training slides to have a quality

00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,079
open source compliance program

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,440
you don't have to use them to be open

00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,079
chain conformant

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,920
but open chain does require training and

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,319
if you need some inspiration

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,200
these reference training slides built

00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,760
for material

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,559
provided by companies such as arm

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,520
qualcomm

00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,119
samsung and royal phillips electronics

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,200
it's available

00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,400
and in the open chain project our

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,960
standard of course

00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,640
is not editable we edit it through a

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,559
formal process with a

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,520
work group and votes on the steering

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:04,240
committee but our reference material

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,440
to help inspire you on training policies

00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,240
checklists

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,480
all of that is cc0 it's effectively

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,079
public domain

00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,680
because we have had a very active

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,559
community and because we've seen a lot

00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,079
of growth

00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,040
since october 2016 we had the feedback

00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,640
that we needed

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:24,160
to make open chain better in some places

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,319
we adjusted language

00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,000
to make it easier to translate or to

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:29,040
read if you're a non-native english

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,520
speaker

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,400
in some places we refined a few of the

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,960
terms

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,119
to help ensure that companies which are

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,920
not in the software field which are very

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,920
different

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,599
to the companies we're used to seeing

00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,200
around linux foundation

00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,880
well that they could use the standard

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,960
too

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,800
from tobacco companies to medical

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,040
companies from banks

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,839
to defense we've had all types of

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,240
engagement and taken all kinds of

00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:57,440
feedback by

00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,760
april 2019

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,559
we had the second generation of our

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,319
standard

00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,720
it wasn't hugely different from the

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:07,119
first but it was refined

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,079
and this version of the standard we knew

00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,800
could work across

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,240
all industry areas and for companies of

00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,640
any size

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,400
especially in the context of working in

00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,240
areas where english is not a first

00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,240
language

00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,079
we built on this standard with

00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,839
additional reference material there's

00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,400
over a thousand documents

00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,480
in our github repository our we call it

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,599
reference library

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,559
by april 2020 we were fully confident

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,000
that open chain

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:38,720
as a standard was done it was

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,079
ready for wider deployment to scale from

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,119
hundreds of companies

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,079
to thousands of companies and the best

00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,319
way to do this

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,280
was to enter a formal standardization

00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,559
process

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,720
so we did joint development foundation

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,000
a foundation that has existed for a

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,240
while

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,800
is focused on helping specification

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,839
projects like open chain

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,319
enter standardization processes

00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:06,480
such as iso indeed it has been part of

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:10,079
the linux foundation ecosystem

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,200
for about a year now and it has become a

00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,920
past submitter

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,680
a fast track submitter to iso since

00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,280
early this year

00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,800
the great thing of working with joint

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,040
development foundation

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,240
was that open chain as a project didn't

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,440
have special domain

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,960
knowledge about iso editing but jdf

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,440
could connect us with the people

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,359
that do we got a pass editor to help us

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,960
reformat where necessary

00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,640
and we got help with the process of

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,960
taking open chain two

00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:43,440
in market since 2020 uh sorry 2019

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:45,839
taking that in 2020 into the iso process

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,960
and graduating it as not just an

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,880
industry standard

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:54,400
but a formal iso international standard

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,640
we submitted in april april 2020

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,079
we went into what's called and this is a

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,000
wordy bit iso

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:04,160
iec jtc jtc1 pass transposition process

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,119
put simply when there's a standard that

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,440
pre-exists

00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,599
it's already deployed it already works

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,079
you don't have to go through a 50 or 60

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,559
month

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,359
edit and publication cycle you just go

00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,720
through around

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:18,400
nine months of review acceptance vote

00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,920
and publication

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,760
we went through the acceptance vote

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,400
finished end of september

00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,400
and now we're currently as of recording

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,720
this on the 25th of november

00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,440
we're currently just waiting to hit the

00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,680
go

00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:36,480
from iso where prf 5230

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,599
which means proof of international

00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,920
standard

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,880
and in a few days we expect iso to

00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,599
release us under

00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,040
is and then a number international

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,599
standard

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,520
long story short open chain in the

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,319
course of around five years

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,160
became a popular standard the first and

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,880
the only standard to deal with open

00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,040
source license compliance

00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,200
after four years and a little bit of

00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,160
refinement it was clear this standard

00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,400
was ready

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,599
to scale to thousands of companies in

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,520
other words

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,160
put simply to help every company in the

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,079
world dealing with open source to have

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,160
the key requirements of a quality open

00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,960
source compliance program

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,640
to do this we went into iso we did that

00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,680
in partnership with joint development

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,559
foundation

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,680
and we're done we passed the process on

00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,240
the approval vote

00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,559
we had great support from jtc one joint

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,040
technical committee one

00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,839
and we're the first linux foundation iso

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,960
standard

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,319
in 14 years the last time we did this we

00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,280
did it directly

00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:40,400
we did it with linux standard base now

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,440
working with joint development

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,839
foundation

00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,680
we've created a process open chain was

00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,599
us as you could say dog fooding it it

00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,760
was our first time through this process

00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,680
we had some learning to do but we've

00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,640
learned it we've codified it we've

00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,640
recorded it

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,720
android development foundation is ready

00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,839
to take other specifications in our

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,000
ecosystem

00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:02,240
and bring them into iso to graduate as

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,240
formal international standards

00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,520
as jim mentioned a little while ago at

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,640
another event

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:13,440
the next standard coming through jdf and

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,480
out of iso is spdx spdx 2.2 has been

00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,760
submitted and

00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:21,440
will graduate somewhere end of q1

00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,839
middle of q2 2020

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,480
that's news to watch for but in the

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,240
short term

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,319
you should come away from this talk

00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,280
aware that open source license

00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,880
compliance

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,520
has an iso international standard

00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,400
that you can access information about

00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,599
this standard

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,359
at www.openchainproject.org

00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,319
that you can self-certify to this

00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:49,040
standard on openchainproject.org

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,559
for free that there's over a thousand

00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,559
reference documents

00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,400
to help you with your processes your

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,680
policy your training

00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,599
at openchainproject.org and there's a

00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,240
vibrant community whether you want to be

00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,200
on a

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,040
global mailing list or a local work team

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,079
whether you want to work in english or

00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,160
german or japanese or chinese we've got

00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:13,119
you covered

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,440
already it's time to be part of this

00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,599
it's time to adopt this standard

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,880
get it into sales and procurement talk

00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,200
with your suppliers

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,040
make it part of your purchasing make it

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,920
part of your pitch

00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,200
as why your company has a great way of

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,480
managing open source

00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,880
and can be trusted to do so effectively

00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,839
remember this standard is all about user

00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,319
companies solving user company problems

00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,200
it makes sure open source is efficient

00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,000
it makes sure

00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,359
it's easy and it makes sure that your

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,960
resources allocated

00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:48,960
are minimum while results are maximized

00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,559

00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,960
very excited to talk to you about risk

00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,200
five

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,319
and to convince you that the time is now

00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,880
for you to help out risk five

00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:19,040
it's truly transformative times where

00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,400
the compute requirements are exceeding

00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,720
moore's law

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,680
look at this graph over here the cpu

00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,799
performance

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,720
basically has plateaued since 2015 while

00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:31,119
we continue to imagine

00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,760
new applications that need more compute

00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:36,240
requirements than we can even afford

00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,119
ai is expanding from data center to the

00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,280
edge

00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,640
growth in embedded endpoints are

00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,040
tremendous

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,799
all these trends are forcing us to shift

00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,000
away from general purpose compute

00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,480
platforms

00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,240
companies are vertically integrating

00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,880
trying to build highly optimized

00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,680
products

00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,079
design domain-specific architectures to

00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,640
build

00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,240
workload-focused platforms what this

00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,079
means to me is that we have

00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:05,680
all the ingredients for a big disruption

00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,839
in our industry here this brings us to

00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:10,079
this inflection point where risk five

00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:12,000
the free and open instruction set

00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,119
architecture is gaining momentum and

00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,359
adoption

00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:17,680
first five is a modern clean slate

00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:20,880
design that delivers scalability

00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,440
and superior performance power and area

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,799
efficiency compared to competing

00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,000
technology

00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,480
risk 5 is engineered for practical use

00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,559
cases

00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,599
across microcontrollers application

00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,079
processors

00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,200
and high performance computing platforms

00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,760
but all in all

00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,520
it is the risk fives openness and lack

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,480
of proprietary lock-in that

00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,680
encourages long-term adoption that is

00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,720
attracting a large

00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,400
community of contributors to rs5

00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,160
so practically what this means for

00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,240
companies that are

00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,520
thinking about using risk 5 or actually

00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,240
using risk 5

00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,319
is that risk 5 reduces the cost of

00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,680
software through community leverage

00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:03,839
and broad reuse

01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,640
so since the start of the risk 5

01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:09,599
foundation since 2015 we have gathered

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,880
more than 750 foundation members across

01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,319
50 countries

01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,280
the 750 members are split across 300

01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,400
companies and

01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,839
institutions and 450 individual

01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:25,119
members 2020

01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:27,599
is the 10th anniversary of risk 5 and in

01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,359
the past 10 years verse 5 has been used

01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,400
in many applications

01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:34,640
and vertical markets at sci-5 we have

01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,280
more than 200 design wins with

01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,799
80 companies including six of the top 10

01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,559
tech companies

01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,400
i like to mention a couple of these

01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,920
applications and vertical markets so

01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,640
that you can get a sense of where

01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,599
our technology is being used fpga

01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,960
harding cores

01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,440
augmented reality audio processing wi-fi

01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,799
bluetooth data plane processing

01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,000
industrial robotics

01:00:54,799 --> 01:01:00,559
human interface design networking edge

01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,280
ai controllers voice recognition

01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,760
smart cities fast storage internet of

01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,319
things

01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,960
satellites you name it risk 5 probably

01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,040
is used

01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,119
in your favorite application or vertical

01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,599
market

01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,480
it is our technology that enabled risk

01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,640
five to

01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,400
get into these applications and vertical

01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,720
markets but

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,480
most of all the most important part was

01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,960
the ris5 ecosystem

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,280
that that enabled all these use cases

01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,440
so let me walk through the current state

01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,400
of the ris 5 ecosystem starting from

01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,200
embedded

01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,400
we have great support of risk 5 in

01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,799
various real-time

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,079
operating systems and trace and debug

01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:42,480
ide tools

01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,760
both in open source and commercial to

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,000
name a couple of

01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,760
open source projects that have risv5

01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,880
support that comes to my mind

01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,760
are ris free rtas rtems

01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,400
riot and zephyr on the commercial side

01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,720
sci-fi

01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,240
has been working with partners such as

01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,520
iar systems

01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:04,720
segger lauterbach wind river green hills

01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:07,760
to design ris 5 solutions and delivering

01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,440
them to our partners together

01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,799
switching on to the linux and

01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,200
application risk 5

01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:15,280
ecosystem side of things starting from

01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:18,720
bootleggers we have core boot

01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:21,359
u-boot uefi tiana core which is an

01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,200
open source implementation of the ufi

01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,240
haveris 5 support

01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:30,160
on the distro side we have debian fedora

01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:33,760
ubuntu gen2 suse open wrt

01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:36,160
freebsd net bsd uh with risk five

01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,160
support

01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:40,160
let's take a closer look at debian

01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,720
debian builds 95

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,960
of packages on risk five this is an

01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,319
important milestone in becoming a normal

01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,480
architecture

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,799
last year at the risk five summit carlos

01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,000
had shown docker and kubernetes on

01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:54,400
debian risk five

01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,880
working on hi5 unleash development board

01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,640
from sci-fi

01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:02,799
looking into fedora in 2018 western

01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,920
digital has done a fedora desktop

01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,480
tutorial

01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,520
the most recent news in 2020 is that the

01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,880
efi boot

01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:12,559
works on hi-fi unleashed and qemu

01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,240
look at this picture over here this is

01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,799
the genome desktop

01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,920
manager working on fedora risk five on

01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,119
top of the high five

01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,119
unleash development board

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,480
at sci-fi we have taken risk five

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,520
ecosystem development very seriously

01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,599
from day one

01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,559
and that's one of the main reasons why

01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:35,760
we started the hi5 development

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,559
program starting from embedded

01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,240
development

01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,559
we have launched high five one

01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:43,440
development board in 2016

01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,400
and subsequently the high five one revv

01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,599
with wi-fi

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,599
and bluetooth support on the

01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,440
application and linux development side

01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:54,480
we have launched hi5 unleash

01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,960
development board back in 2018

01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,400
and we have worked with partners like

01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,760
microchip

01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:05,200
to develop the hi5 unleash expansion kit

01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:09,440
with pull of fire fpga

01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,400
to provide ios and capabilities to

01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,880
extend

01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,680
the high five unleash development boards

01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,880
to design your own domain specific

01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,240
computers all in all these high five

01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,400
development boards had

01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,599
enabled the first wave of first five

01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,599
ecosystem development

01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:32,400
switching to the risk 5 software

01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:34,720
uh state of things we have

01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,960
pretty much all the important open

01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,440
source software projects having risk 5

01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,119
support

01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,680
all upstream to their respective

01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:44,720
projects just to name a couple of

01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:48,640
few projects that have risk 5 support

01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:51,920
are gcc llvm gdb venuetills

01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,920
new lib glibc linux kernel and qmu

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,359
all have risk 5 support in their

01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,640
respective upstream

01:04:55,359 --> 01:05:02,000
open source repositories

01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,720
at sci-fi we have a couple of software

01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,039
products

01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,559
as well these are the four pillars of

01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,599
our software products starting from

01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,920
freedom studio

01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,280
which is our eclipse cnc plus plus

01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,039
development environment

01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,520
which integrates service 5 cross

01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:18,000
compiler open ocd debugger

01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:20,799
segger j link debugger qmu emulator with

01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,119
the freedom estk software package

01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,960
freedom tools is sci-fi's risk 5

01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,680
development tools package which

01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,039
integrates all the sub-components and is

01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,880
released on a

01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:34,880
normal cadence freedom esdk is our bare

01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,280
metal software development kit

01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,760
freedom usdk is our linux software

01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,720
development kit based on yakto and open

01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,039
embedded

01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,039
i have prepared a short video to show

01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,559
you the state of the current ris5

01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:50,650
software ecosystem

01:05:46,559 --> 01:06:06,160
so let's take a look

01:05:50,650 --> 01:06:08,160
[Music]

01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,400
freedom studio is sci-fi's free

01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,319
all-in-one software development ide

01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,920
freedom studio bundles all the tools

01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,520
necessary to get started developing

01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,079
software on risk five

01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,319
whether you are using hi5 series boards

01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,559
or an fpga board with an ip package

01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,240
downloaded from sci-fi core designer

01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,319
freedom studio provides access to all

01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,960
the advanced debugging features in sci-5

01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,440
cores

01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,960
including trace peripheral viewers

01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,119
advanced hardware triggers

01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,559
and performance counters with freedom

01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,640
studio you'll be creating

01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:47,839
building and debugging risk 5 software

01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:47,839
in minutes

01:06:52,330 --> 01:07:09,520
[Music]

01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:11,839
it's using the the j-link gdb

01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,640
server to communicate with the j-link on

01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:15,680
this board

01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:18,160
click debug and essentially the j-link

01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,839
gdb server will connect to the target

01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:29,839
and download the

01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:29,839
project or the code

01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:55,089
[Music]

01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,480
so if you're looking for a sequence

01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,000
diagram like

01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,839
feature we have something a chart that's

01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,520
built in that will show you the flow as

01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:11,680
it goes from for example

01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:14,240
function 10 here back up to

01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,689
in essence main and then back down to

01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:22,880
function 11.

01:08:16,689 --> 01:08:25,120
[Music]

01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,480
what i have here is the ir embedded

01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,560
workbench for risk five

01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,600
when you start embedded workbench you

01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,159
have this

01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,799
information center with some additional

01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,279
information

01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,400
product explorer user guides example

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,440
projects

01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,640
we may have support for all cars here

01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,960
from sci-fi

01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,560
if you look under the view menu you will

01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,560
have all the capabilities

01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,199
you have information about the call

01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,000
stack breakpoints that you are using

01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:53,679
we of course support data breakpoints

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,679
you can look into the memory

01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,960
you have all the registers everything

01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:07,839
very easy and

01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:07,839
easy to use

01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,359
hope you enjoyed the video risk 5 has

01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,759
made tremendous progress

01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,960
in the past five years and i personally

01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,319
wanted to say

01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,319
thank you for a contribution

01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,279
okay let's switch gears and talk a bit

01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,040
about the future risk five

01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,319
personally i think the name of the game

01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,239
is to capture the core

01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,400
of the next generation leading compute

01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:39,279
platforms in intelligent edge

01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,400
storage mobile high performance

01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,520
computing

01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:46,560
networking embedded automotive

01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,040
and 5g base station the key to success

01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,000
here

01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,880
is having the risk 5 software ecosystem

01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,799
and the risk 5

01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,840
ecosystem for these applications and

01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:58,000
vertical markets ready to go

01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,000
to that extent at sci-fi we have

01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,600
launched the hi-5 and master development

01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,159
board the next generation risk 5

01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,440
development

01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:09,280
board last october this high five match

01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:10,640
development board has the sci-5s fu 740

01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,719
processor here

01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,760
integrates eight gigabytes of ddr4

01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,199
memory with

01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,000
four of the usb 3.2 gen1 ports gigabit

01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:21,600
ethernet

01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,640
micro usb a micro sd card slot here

01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,960
and a by 16 pcie expansion slot backed

01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,320
by

01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:32,000
pci gen 3x8 lanes and an nvme

01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:34,320
m.2 slot and an m.2 e key for wi-fi and

01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,880
bluetooth expansion capabilities

01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,760
this all comes in a mini itx pc form

01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,920
factor with an

01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:44,080
atx 24 pin power supply connector

01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,280
high five the match development board is

01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,120
the result of

01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,640
hearing your feedback so what we've

01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,719
heard from you is

01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,159
you love the linux capable risk 5

01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,400
development platform

01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,600
but would like a bit more advanced

01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,400
features such as

01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:01,120
more processing capabilities high-speed

01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,719
ios with expansion capabilities

01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,120
pretty much coming in an industry

01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:07,520
standard form factor and out-of-the-box

01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,840
software has to work

01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,800
this is a result of the high five of

01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,360
match board here

01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,280
and now let's take a look at the fu 740

01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,080
soc in more detail

01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,600
this soc integrates four of the u-74

01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,159
application processors

01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,920
with an s7 embedded processor the

01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:26,960
saffron series cpu

01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,840
is our 64 bit eight stage dual issue

01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,840
super scalar risk five cores

01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,080
all these five cores are coherently

01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,520
backed by a two megabyte l2 cache which

01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,400
is backed by a dd4

01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,080
ddr4 memory controller the soc

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,560
integrates a pcie

01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,000
gen 3x8 controller with a gigabit

01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,400
ethernet controller

01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,159
and a bunch of peripherals now let's

01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:55,840
take a look at the high fiber mesh

01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:55,840
development board in action

01:11:56,790 --> 01:12:15,569
[Music]

01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:22,270
[Music]

01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:31,989
so

01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:31,989
[Music]

01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,840
so

01:12:39,920 --> 01:13:02,439
[Music]

01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:08,020
me

01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:08,020
[Music]

01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,590
[Music]

01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:43,979
uh

01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:43,979
[Music]

01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:57,960
[Music]

01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:12,760
me

01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:12,760
[Music]

01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,840
me

01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,880
that was pretty cool just a quick recap

01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,719
on high five unmatched

01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,000
the board will be available in a couple

01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,719
weeks you can put your

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,920
order online at crowdsupply or mouser

01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,760
for more information

01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,400
just go online and search for high five

01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,679
and match or visit scifi.com for slash

01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,840
boards

01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,920
as i mentioned before risk 5 software

01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,040
has made tremendous progress over the

01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,280
past couple years

01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:47,280
but we could definitely use your help to

01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,080
be more concrete the risk 5 porting work

01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:51,120
has begun

01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:53,840
on uefi v8 java

01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,400
and android but obviously these projects

01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,719
could go

01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,560
much faster if you're willing to jump in

01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:01,199
and help out

01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,840
in conclusion let's go build the ris5

01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:06,159
ecosystem together for a better future

01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,239
these look like big mounds to climb but

01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:09,360
let's not forget it's about this virtual

01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,440
cycle here

01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,480
start from risk 5 of free and open

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,719
architecture

01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,719
add your commercial innovation here and

01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,880
with community contribution

01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:21,199
we'll end up with a much stronger base

01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,280
for a better future

01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:25,679
i'm counting on your support thank you

01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:28,400
