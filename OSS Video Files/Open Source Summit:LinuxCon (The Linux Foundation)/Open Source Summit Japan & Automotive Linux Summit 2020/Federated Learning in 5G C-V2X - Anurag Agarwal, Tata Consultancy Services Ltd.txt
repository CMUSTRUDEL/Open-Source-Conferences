	00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,839
so first of all thanks for joining in

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,759
uh for this wonderful event and i hope

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,800
everybody is safe

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,840
and in this pandemic time and

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,679
at home and working your you know

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,880
taking care of your daily activities

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,080
working across

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,880
from home itself stay safe okay

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,359
so just to start with the session uh

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,560
today

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,480
uh as part of this event i

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
have will be covering a small

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,800
presentation on

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
how we can use federated learning in a

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,680
connected car scenario

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,360
and how we can use that uh in an era

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,960
where 5g is bringing

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,800
a lot more communication at my devices

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,480
so the whole idea uh

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,480
so before i get into the agenda let me

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,199
just introduce myself

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,480
my name is anurag agarwal and i am

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,719
currently working as

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,600
solution architect with tata consultancy

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,520
services in

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,400
india hyderabad and i am taking care of

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
multiple initiatives in my center of

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
excellence

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,080
with respect to 5g and how we can use

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,119
the spicy technologies

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,040
in different uh industry segments

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,840
be it smart manufacturing vehicles

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
beat automobiles and uh different

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,960
aspects

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,119
so but my out of my personal interest uh

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,479
automotive is one of the areas which i

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,720
keep focusing on

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,920
and we have also you know developed

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
multiple uh

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,079
uh reference use because i'll not say

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,560
industry level use cases but reference

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,079
use case to showcase the capability

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,360
of ai nml and how that can be leveraged

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,560
in industry so as part of the today's

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,240
discussion uh we will be briefly

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,759
touching upon what is 5g

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,520
and how what is 5g v2x connectivity and

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,520
how does it help you

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
connect vehicles to the network and what

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,520
kind of messages they can

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,920
in exchange and we will be talking about

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,239
autonomous vehicles and connected

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
connectivity requirements

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
what are they imposing on the network

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
then we will be

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
briefly touching about the federated

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,319
learning

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,239
their challenges some open source

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,200
frameworks and

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,160
then i will be coming to a small

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,760
architecture

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,879
uh where we will we see that how

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,920
a 5g along with my ai

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,800
and edge how that will fit into one my

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,319
network going ahead and how is these

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
technology will be you know

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,040
leveraging each other across to create

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
an end-to-end use case more intelligent

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
more

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
autonomous use case that's something i

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
will try to you know highlight and catch

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
up on that

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,959
and at the end i will just uh briefly

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,280
touch

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,160
explain one of my use case that we have

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,720
uh

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,239
you know implemented in my labs and then

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,680
i will be open for question answer

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,840
question and answers but feel free to uh

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,000
drop drop any questions in the chat box

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,280
uh question q a chat box i will

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,040
uh take up as and when i can you know

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,760
take them up now so quickly starting to

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,239
it

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,360
so how do we typically see uh you know

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
automobile uh

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
the back like two decades back until two

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,959
days back

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
when we talked about an automotive

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
standard

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,200
you know geared or non-geared cars with

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,120
basic functionalities and some certain

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,239
automation features like cruise controls

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,840
or so you know

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,000
certain certain controls within within

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,120
the driver's seat

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
then the error came off the bluetooth

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
wi-fi

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,799
3g and 4g you started getting some

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,879
sensors on my devices

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,640
like gps on board sensors there's

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,519
certain onboard sensor way

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,280
which can started helping my drivers

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,760
assistance so basically what happened is

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
it

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,599
started giving a certain level of

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
automation

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,439
with conditional autonomous when i say

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
conditional

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,840
autonomous which means uh

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
it needs certain driver assistance along

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,239
with

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,599
certain functionality being offloaded to

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,200
the device

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
in this case when i say device in this

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,400
case i'm talking about the automobile

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,079
so it can be certain

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,160
you know activities are being performed

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,720
by vehicles but under the guidance of

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
the

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,600
driver now then the era

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,960
is what i call it today's era where

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,320
we are leveraging 4g and

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,040
5g to

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
to create and next generation uh

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
vehicles

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,280
autonomous autonomous vehicles are the

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,440
talk of the town

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
everybody's talking about that there are

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
a lot of

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,880
companies all big names are working on

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,800
it a couple of them has done their test

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,880
drives

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,080
few of them has also launched on road

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,160
but unfortunately

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,520
it's not foolproof yet because there's a

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,680
long way to go

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:08,240
and what what isn't making that happen

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,000
is the compute the low cost of compute

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,039
when it's a low compute means

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,199
i have my compute has become so cheap

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,720
that i can bring that on board on my

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,560
device itself

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,199
i can you know not only just rely on

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,440
those

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,720
data from my sensors which is there in

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
my vehicle

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
but i can also connect to the network

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,759
and get some relevant information

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
and then take a decision so i have huge

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,759
amount of

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,280
onboard compute i have hundreds of

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,560
sensors on my

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,800
you know vehicle then i have

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,360
cameras high precision cameras which can

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,160
you know can be my third eye a driver's

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,320
third eye

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,759
and eventually that will be the only eye

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,960
of the vehicle so the idea is can i

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,199
eventually you will see a lot of

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,440
you know processing uh your vehicle is

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,039
no less than a computer eventually

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,319
so now okay now

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,160
this is what we have we have it we are

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,520
in research in today and

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,000
this will be further even uh evolve

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,039
it will further evolve uh as the

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
technology

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,479
all as we achieve more and more

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,319
optimization

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,479
so this will eventually evolve but what

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,759
is another key factor here is to make it

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,840
happen is other

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,759
along with my all board sensors and

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,960
onboard compute

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,080
is the communication so what file is

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,919
bringing you

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,960
what frank he's typically promising

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,759
promises is a high very high bandwidth

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,880
ultra low latency and very high uh

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,639
reliability

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,840
so with this promises it becomes

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,400
very evident these technologies uh

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,440
specifically with 5g

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,919
that can be leveraged in vehicles

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,080
as part of this endeavor what the

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,520
standard bodies have started doing is

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,440
they have you know specifically started

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,759
customizing

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,560
my 5g stack to support vehicles

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,319
so along with so for that what they've

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,880
done is they have started

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,479
studying multiple use cases so if if my

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
two makers have to communicate with each

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,280
other

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,120
how will they do that if my vehicle has

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,840
to communicate to a pedestrian

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,520
walking the road or a cyclist who's you

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,560
know going on a cycle

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,160
or or to uh infrastructure what kind of

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,560
a different changes would be required

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,319
at the same time it is also trying to

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,800
not just connect between vehicles

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,199
it is also trying to look at if i have

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,240
if my vehicle has to connect to a

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,759
network and guts uh get some

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,080
uh information from from uh

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
a cloud in servers or somewhere around

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,319
that

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,560
what would it take to do to you know

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,759
enhance my stack in such a way that i

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,280
should be able to support

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,319
that along with my regular uh emp

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,639
traffic

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
so with this now they have already

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,240
defined that

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,240
so they they started with d2d technology

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,440
way back like a couple of years back

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
which they further

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,720
enhanced it to make it specifically for

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,000
uh

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,400
vehicles now what happened is this this

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,080
vehicle has evolved in release 14 which

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,440
is the previous release and at least 15

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,160
which is a five-year release

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,360
now it has come up with a stage where it

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
can

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
uh i can say it can be adopted by uh

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
different industry uh

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,680
vacant industry segments now the kind of

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,599
use case that we will

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,599
we have already started seeing right i

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,399
should not say we will because

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,480
a couple of them has already been you

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,480
know

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,279
experimented along they have been you

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,399
know tried on or they have the

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,880
lot of uh

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,920
trials are going around the world so one

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,160
of them very interesting

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,519
which i find myself is intelligent

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,000
traffic routing

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,800
where you can you know if i can manage

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,399
my traffic

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,399
considering that all the vehicles are

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,640
either connected or autonomous

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
uh my vehicle i should be able to route

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,080
my traffic structure whether minimal

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,680
traffic jams i can lower my carbon

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,120
footprint i can you know ensure my

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,160
emergency vehicles are

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,000
on uh research destination time so when

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,279
i come to emergency vehicles that is one

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
of the use cases which i will

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,080
probably be showcasing towards the end

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,360
of for this presentation

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,680
uh the second kind of use case which

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,800
are very prominent i briefly touched

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,640
upon uh was

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,720
autonomous vehicle with on-board

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,320
intelligence my vehicle can think of

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,040
itself

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,120
it has its own brain now and then the

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,839
real-time information infotainment where

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,320
you have

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,600
you know you can have a live tv in the

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,519
in your vehicle

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,040
all the entertainment kind of you know

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,560
scenarios where you you don't really

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,640
need to use your mobile

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,839
but you have that kind of a connectivity

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,839
in building your vehicle

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,880
so that that that make

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,440
the communication connectivity a low low

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,279
latency in high reliability reliability

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,399
communication connectivity

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,240
of a very important factor to

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,959
for this this industry to evolve

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,279
now with when we talk about autonomous

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,399
or

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,640
autonomy in vehicles we

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,920
we briefly spoke about like what are the

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,120
different use cases so

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,440
at the same time uh what does it bring

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,079
in

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
what kind of expectation does it have

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,399
from the network

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,279
though 3gbp and other standards bodies

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,399
are working to go

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,200
towards to make it happen and try to to

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,240
you know bring

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,079
in that kind of uh

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,279
or achieve the requirements what they

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,120
are imposing on us

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,880
but if you look at just to just to you

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,160
know give that kind of an uh

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,399
feel i just put together a few numbers

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,000
uh which which can help us understand

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,959
the kind of requirement that we are

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,920
looking at

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,519
so for example uh for a use case of

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,880
vehicle polluting

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,760
now uh

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,839
[Applause]

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,200
they need so when when we talk about

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,120
vehicle polluting

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,519
uh platooning sorry platooning

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,399
my bad uh so what they do is they

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,760
vehicle one is moving in the front and

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,839
vehicle two is moving

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,600
the pad following the vehicle one so in

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,440
this case the latency is very important

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,440
because as soon as this guys breaks

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,800
this should be able to uh break

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,920
immediately without

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,440
you know hitting that vehicle

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,200
so so they're looking at very low

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,600
latency of 10 milliseconds or

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,519
maybe less than that reliability has to

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,160
be minimum of

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,839
nine force and data rate has to be very

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,440
high because they will be exchanging

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,560
huge amount of data

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,040
to ensure that they are not

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,240
going to collide under any circumstances

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,240
similarly

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
when in advance driving scenarios you

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,720
you have

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,320
much lower latency required you have in

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
remote driving similarly the remote

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
driving says somebody is driving from

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,120
some

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,200
remote location you're making much more

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,480
uh

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,959
reliability and much higher elaborating

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,000
which should be around five six or sorry

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,000
five nines or

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
six nines similarly

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,680
but but again sorry uh unlike other use

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,760
cases where downlink data is

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,600
key in this case in remote driving

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,880
uplink data is another key requirement

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,320
when i say

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,519
data which means the data being sent by

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,200
the vehicle towards the network is also

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,399
very important typically what happens is

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,639
downlink is

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
higher and uplink is slower but in this

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,360
case what they expect is

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,680
upping has to be higher because along

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
with

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,120
getting instruction it is also sending

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,360
huge amount of data towards

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,760
the server so that the remote assistance

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
or the more remote or persons sitting in

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,959
the remote site

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,560
should be able to get all the you know

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,360
sensor data in real time and should be

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,800
able to act

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,320
on it then certain other use cases like

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,760
public safeties

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,000
city infrastructure and connected

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,160
vehicles are also imposing similar kind

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
of

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,320
requirements on the network

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,399
now uh i'm sure a couple of you has

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,839
must have seen similar kind of uh an

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,600
architecture

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,959
for onboard connectivity in in an

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,279
autonomous vehicles

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,000
where you have you will be having a high

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,680
performance

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,560
compute with cpu and rams along with my

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,839
gpus

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,680
fpgas and dsps because that is one of

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,279
uh you know conventionally also they

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,480
have been the faster

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,480
uh processing

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,639
process faster processors than cpu user

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,959
ram

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,079
uh and on top of that then you will be

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,000
having um

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,560
your uh some some operating system in

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,079
this case

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,040
uh pv what we had in our lab is

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,079
auto grid linux which we use to create

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
our own uh

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,000
a small proof of concept of prototype

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,040
for that then

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,560
uh then

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,160
you will have so some edge platform now

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,639
i'll i'll come to that what edge

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,399
platform

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
uh when i say explain what does it mean

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,079
here but but

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,440
uh before going to that let me also

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,600
touch upon all these

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,040
inputs sensors typically what you have

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,880
you have multiple input sensors

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,800
we talked about that and then you have a

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,440
collection engine which collects this

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,639
sensor data at a you know predefined

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,199
frequency

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,240
and then it will send to the telematics

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,600
engine

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,800
analytics engine and then

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,079
based on certain decisions it takes

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,600
uh based on my rule engine and my

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,959
certain decisions it will go and take

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,880
or assist my driver or my autonomous car

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,000
to to perform for multiple actions

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,120
now this is something which will run

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
inside the vehicle but at the same time

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,800
to

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,320
take this decision intelligently more

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,199
precise decision

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
it needs certain data from outside world

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,839
so for that we

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,639
will we have seen that 5g model or 4g

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,360
modern

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,880
i mean for 5g connectivity has started

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,680
you know

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,639
getting a space in this on entire

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,880
architecture

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
now coming back to what device edge

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,639
platform here means

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,079
this this device such platform means i

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,360
should be able to write certain

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,959
applications

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,839
not just one time one it should it helps

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,160
you make a

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,600
flexible architecture where i have the

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,000
flexibility

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,199
of deploying multiple more applications

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,360
on

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:10,560
on board and take care of data

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,959
plane movement rather than

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,720
you know a fixed

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,880
implementation i have more flexible

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,440
implementation so this this gives you

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,120
certain you know flexibility of

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
taking care of life life cycle

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,600
management of this

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,079
application be it remotely

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
or be locally that depends on the kind

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,959
of uh

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,959
computer i have on this platform

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,079
so so uh

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,800
now what what now this is this is the

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,720
overall architecture but now another key

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,720
aspect which i want to highlight here is

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
again i rather i should say highlight

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,600
here is the 5g

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,639
uh connectivity now what does it mean

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,959
what does it do for you it brings in

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,839
the direct or indirect communication of

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,839
the network

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,839
uh it helps you you know

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,839
exchange my sensor data towards the

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,880
network or even receive

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:19,839
uh those sensor data from nearby

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,839
vehicles or from the network

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,439
sorry okay uh

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,720
so uh now let's let's typically uh

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,840
no let's touch upon this

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
the intelligence building block uh so

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
let me just go back to the previous

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,799
screen for a moment

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
so in this screen that you see that we

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,360
talked about this intelligent

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,600
applications analytics engine and

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,160
telemetrics engine so what does it

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,880
uh i will just try to expand that in

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
little more

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,039
uh so in this case what we're saying

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,360
okay what we typically have

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,640
is you sense that some data then you

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,799
identify

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
what kind of an object what are the

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,720
different attributes

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,160
from these sensors and then you create a

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,000
perception

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,240
okay uh you create a model you you you

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
for example if i have to crack an object

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,960
of

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,120
for in the case of a vehicle polluting

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
i am supposed to follow an object in

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,200
front of me

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,280
so it recognize the subject it

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
start tracking it it creates a model and

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,760
ensure that

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
what are the different parameters i need

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,559
to ensure that i i am

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,720
in in certain distance to them i am

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,320
am i getting all the parameters of them

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,240
then it creates

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,760
based on this perception it takes a

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,640
certain decision

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,280
it defines its path it defines its uh

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,360
you know

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,039
location and speed and everything it can

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,559
take control of that

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,559
now as we saw in the previous slide

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,840
uh i spoke about the edge compute

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,200
platform

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,440
now this this is what it

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,039
brings in for you it gives you

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,160
surrounding awareness

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,960
from based on intelligent sensors

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,039
object classification hardware and

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,679
hardware compute but at the same time i

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,840
see them as

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,880
challenges as well when i say challenges

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,480
because the more you

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,240
from if you look especially if you look

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,679
from an automatic industry the more you

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,679
or the more precise uh

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,880
you you want a precision you want in

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,799
this case

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:30,320
you have to have a high compute

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,360
blocks on your vehicles which means

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,000
the cost will go high eventually

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,840
and you need more power too so your

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,720
power requirements goes high your cost

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
goes high

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,000
and then your uh maintenance goes high

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,320
because then you have control

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,360
the software upgrades this risk of

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,640
security

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,760
so that so to take care of those things

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,160
we have to you know ensure that

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,440
we have a balance between them similarly

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,600
with network compute

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,840
uh network thumb sorry network

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,640
connectivity and edge compute

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,200
you do get a network awareness you do

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,559
get

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
contact separate decision making

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,159
capability and you do get

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,080
a higher reliability network but at the

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,720
same time going back to my previous

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,640
thing is

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,480
the security is one of the biggest

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,640
challenge which

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,840
poses a huge risk in in you know

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,840
achieving a full autonomy

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,559
typically what happens is you have

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,960
certain person

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,480
with aiml what you have is you have

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,200
certain business rules

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,559
which you apply on your devices it sends

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,280
the training data sets

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,039
onto my storage server onto the my cloud

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,600
which has a storage server

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,120
my algorithm running and it it optimizes

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,159
your models and waits and it sends you

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,360
back

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,799
but what we typically see is who is

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
doing the entire heavyweight

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,840
weightlifting

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,039
is my this communication channel

00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,159
and my computer on the cloud but with

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,159
reduced cost

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,039
so so how how we can

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,159
uh with sorry so with the reduced cost

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,280
i can technically you know shift some of

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,559
these heavy weights

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,559
onto the devices so for that i think

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,159
federated learning is one of the key

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,520
concepts

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,080
uh is again it's no different than ai ml

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,760
but just a different way of

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,039
implementing my ml algorithms

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,360
so it talks about actually uh how you

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,400
train your algorithms

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,440
on a decentralized architecture so we'll

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,640
be talking about

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,640
okay i have a centralized server

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,080
which can do all my heavy lifting part

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960
but at the same time when i have

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,520
enough compute so can i offer part of

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,480
that

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,679
on my way on my device rather than doing

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,039
all the computation here

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,440
and then sending sending the model back

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,480
to them

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,880
so the idea is offload

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,480
part of it here on these devices so that

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,120
they can take

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,600
the wrong care of the computer their own

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,280
part

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,480
and then sense the only the new

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,600
optimized model on on

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,760
the cloud so that which which it can

00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,760
collate

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,440
and then sends back to everyone so now

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,760
everybody has a global data

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,480
global model but what they are working

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,520
on is

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,520
only the computation for the local data

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,799
right so let me say

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,840
we saw this slide where we say okay all

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,720
this company

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,840
uh sorry uh

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,840
just give me a water break

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,880
so what we saw is in the previous slide

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
that this entire

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,240
heavy weight lifting has been done by

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
that but what i explained in this thing

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,679
is okay i have

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,760
you know offload some of the compute on

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,720
the device itself

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,280
so that i'm not sending the entire

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,960
training

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:12,080
data set on the server i can reduce the

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,840
uh you know load on my

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,039
communication channel with it it helps

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,039
me reduce the overall

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,400
bandwidth requirement of my

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,000
communication channel

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,960
and at the same time it will

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,520
ask each devices devices to do some kind

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,240
of uh

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,760
uh heavy lifting part of it which will

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,840
be much smaller from the from

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,880
that device perspective so in overall

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,720
sense

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
i'm still running a similar kind of an

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,039
architecture

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,480
but i have not offloaded some part of it

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,520
here

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,039
and and without without compromising

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,039
on their uh

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,760
you know the model or the the

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,480
performance of the algorithms or the

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,080
optimization

00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,320
part of it without impacting that

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,799
but federated learning comes with

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,640
certain challenges

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:10,080
now as we see uh in an iot world or

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:13,679
or in a in an era where

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,679
all my devices are getting connected

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,679
the number of devices will be huge

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,279
enormous

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,520
we are talking about multi millions and

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,480
multi billions of devices

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,600
so with that what does it mean even with

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,279
this approach

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,320
there will be huge amount of data on the

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,559
network so we have to ensure

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,559
that

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,600
the balance between my communication uh

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,440
the network oh sorry the balance between

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,720
the kind of data that we're transmitting

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,960
from my devices

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,400
or the models or how do we design that

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,480
that has to be taken care

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,320
even with that kind of a bandwidth which

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,159
five is gonna provide us

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,080
that might not be enough in future

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,640
again the privacy concern is one of the

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,120
biggest concern because

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,000
though it helps you you know take you

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,200
know

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,520
store the data locally but at the same

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
time

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,520
you know you have to ensure that your

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,679
model is secure

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,039
you should not somebody who's fishing

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,320
out in the network should not be able to

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,400
you know fish out here

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,000
so your the network security is at most

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,120
important

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,159
uh right so another important factor is

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,200
the network

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:32,400
or system heterogeneity so

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,720
uh like i said like now we are going to

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,400
have

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,919
huge number of devices but those devices

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,559
will be of different

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,799
you know make different

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,000
purpose they might not be all of them

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,520
might not be of

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,360
a vehicle so they may have i can i can

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,159
have an art of home automation i can

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,200
have

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,440
a factory automation or or

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,840
street lights but on a street light you

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,640
can't have uh you know huge

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,320
compute there similarly you will have

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,159
you know few devices which can

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,520
support huge compute because they have

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,200
that kind of a power

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,760
support they have that kind of a space

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,279
to add that kind of uh

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,240
or uh compute there

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,559
but there's certain devices which cannot

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,120
so

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,279
so system heterogeneity is not so i

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,600
cannot say that my federal learning

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,240
algorithm will work in all the

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,240
conditions

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,720
and another very important uh

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,960
challenge which we see is the

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,919
statistical heterogeneity

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,000
now since all those devices which will

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,679
be generating this data will not be the

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,679
same format

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,799
they will not be in a similar kind of an

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,200
architecture

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,880
so how do i take care of that part if i

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
have to create an algorithm

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,039
if i have to you know distribute my uh

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,559
heavy lifting part of my different

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,640
devices

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,279
how do i get that all of them should be

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,559
able to send a similar kind of a model

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,640
so that my my uh

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,600
server or my centralized unit should be

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,559
able to you know

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,080
collect them all create a generic global

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,360
model and send them back

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,000
so for that uh before i before i jump to

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,919
that but

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,600
let me quickly touch upon the for the

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,919
different open source uh

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,960
frameworks which are available right now

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,919
this is just a very

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,399
small list of it there a couple of more

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,559
which

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:35,799
are being used by different you know

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,559
organization developers and uh but but

00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:39,520
a few of them which i have personally

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,840
used

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,080
and have touched upon them is the python

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,159
since tensorflow

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,159
and keras so these are the ones which

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,720
are being used as i have been reading

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,240
very recently that i torch is one of

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,600
the most you know a favorite uh

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,600
getting the favorite spot with

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
automotive industry they're trying to

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,480
see if

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,679
pie torch can be used i they find more

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,440
useful in terms of

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,440
you know designing the algorithms for uh

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,880
automotive industry the use case whereas

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,240
tensorflow vc

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,080
has a huge amount of libraries which

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,520
which can help you to quickly develop

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,320
your models and you know

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,600
get get your application or use case

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
implemented

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,039
but uh yeah so coming back to my

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,320
previous topic on

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,840
how do i how do these heterogeneous

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
devices the hydrating is

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,240
models uh how do i convert that into a

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
single model

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,320
so now i can have multiple

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,200
implementation of or these devices and

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,520
can have a mult

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,480
different kind of an implementation or

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,679
on on different

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,360
uh devices

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,360
but there's a one one

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,360
tool by uh again supported by

00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,080
open source community called one index

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,880
open format for machine learning models

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,840
which allows you which helps you convert

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,200
any model

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,159
into a standardized model

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,000
so that beat whatever device be it i'm

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,440
sending something on the cloud something

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
on the device

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,039
i'm using whatever you know training

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
frameworks here

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,640
i should be able to use a similar model

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,399
this is this i believe

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,520
one good approach uh though it still

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,600
needs uh i believe

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,640
that still i think it is still evolving

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,320
but but

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,919
this is one of one of the good good

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,840
approach that will help us

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,440
design future uh

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,240
machine learning algorithm the federal

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,880
learning algorithms uh so that

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,159
so what it helps you with this is more

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,120
of interruptability

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,399
without without uh knowing who whom i'm

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,480
going to work with

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,440
and it also at the same time gives you a

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,520
huge amount of

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,200
hardware acceleration when it's a huge

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,480
amount which means it supports cpu it

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,799
supports gpu it's

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,320
for fpga i don't really have as a

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,200
developer i really don't have to worry

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,559
about that

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,600
i can just convert my my model in

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,000
uh into a nexus or another supported

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,840
model

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,360
and then send it to my device or vice

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,760
versa if i'm receiving something on my

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,840
from

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,399
sending something from my device and i

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,320
can convert that into onenote

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,399
and send it on to my training framework

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,840
so that way actually i will be able to

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,640
you know design my algorithm

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,960
or implement my algorithm is much faster

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,120
and

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,120
without much hassle

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,159
okay

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:42,320
coming to uh

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,720
how this overall system would look like

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,120
or how we can you know leverage a

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,559
federated learning kind of an algorithm

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,360
or kind of an architecture with my 5g

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,039
networks this is i have tried to put

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,679
together different blocks

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,760
i think it's too much of different

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,240
blocks on a single screen and

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,760
too much to discuss here but let me just

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,440
quickly touch upon

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,760
i will try to touch upon different

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,240
aspects of the entire network and how

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,600
how these things will work and how will

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,799
they help you

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:19,840
uh to design an overall system now as we

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,840
briefly uh talked about uh

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,320
the kind of devices will be there in the

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,840
network right

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,880
now i have

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,200
say this vehicles then i

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,559
so if i have a vehicle network these

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,320
vehicles can talk to each other

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,919
they will have an edge platform edge

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,480
applications

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,679
uh which which might be doing uh

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
telematics engine

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,120
or analytics engines and on top of them

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,039
you have your

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,279
ai ml application and your ml model

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,080
now they what they will do is they will

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,640
just

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,279
use a 5g connectivity okay but before i

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,240
get into that

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,200
but first let me explain the uh overall

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,200
architecture so

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,240
typically what you have in a 5g network

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,120
is

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,480
you have your telco platform uh these

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,919
days everybody is talking about the

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,080
cloud platform even

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,440
conventionally they have a bare metal uh

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,960
platform so now you eventually you will

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,279
see you have a cloud platform

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,399
underlying your kubernetes dockers open

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,200
stack

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,120
bare metal as a service architecture and

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,360
multiple hardware accelerations

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,399
so which will be creating a baseline for

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,960
your hardware

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,760
or a platform and then on top of it you

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,159
have the radio access network

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,960
which now we have started seeing you

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,679
know much much

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,720
much more disabilitation so that i can

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,240
support multiple

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,480
different kind of devices different kind

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,360
of uh vendors to

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,640
to connect to and on top of that you

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,760
have

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,320
this edge platform now orion is another

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,279
alliance

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,000
who's driving this initiative which

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,279
ensure that

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,240
you have a framework to define

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,919
um oh sorry framework to deploy your

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,039
applications

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,360
with accelerated data path

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,679
and then you have typical management

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,640
system and osspss on top of it and then

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,080
you have

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,799
another key components coming into the

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,080
picture is machine learning of

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,200
operations and uh management

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,519
uh to help you deploy

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,600
those certain applications here and then

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,320
you have the orchestration engine

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,440
the network function managers and

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,720
infrastructure managers

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,320
so this overall creates the overall

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,880
architecture of a network

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,480
with with 5g and how these devices would

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,240
be connecting is through

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,080
my 5g uh radio links now in this case my

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,519
say let's say i have this vehicle

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,960
who has all uh the compute to

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,760
run all the heavy lifting algorithms on

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,760
its own

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,919
it can run that and just share the model

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,200
now with with this with the application

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,039
which is running on my cloud

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,560
now in this case what happens is i can

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,000
design an application

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,520
i might have a requirement of an

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,200
application which i don't want to deploy

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,320
somewhere in the cloud but i want to

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,679
have it on prem so for example in the

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,679
factory automation

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,359
right so in factory automation what is

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,800
this they talk about i

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,440
need something which is on-prem so i can

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,240
deploy my cloud component within my

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,800
premises

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,240
next to my radio so that i can reduce

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,560
the overall latency

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,119
so if i i need a use case where my

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,119
latencies are my utmost importance

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:44,000
i can deploy it near to my brand itself

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,000
right now

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,800
let's assume a scenario uh where i have

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,839
multiple other sensors

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,359
what they will do is excuse me

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,160
sorry so what they will do is

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,560
rather than running this entire content

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,680
on them they will just send the data

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,480
and my ml application running here will

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,480
take care of that

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:15,359
right so so idea is how do i leverage

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,040
what level of edge i should be

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,800
leveraging

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,000
to to run my algorithm how can i break

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,200
that into this entire

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,960
algorithm or ml in such a way that

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,280
i can use the compute of my local device

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,720
or my edge device or my far edge which

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,359
is somewhere in the cloud i should be

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,119
able to

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:40,800
design so moving on uh okay so moving

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,800
before i jump into a demo let me

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,359
also take a minute to talk about on h

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,560
device i i think i briefly just spoke

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,920
about it so when i say

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,960
edge uh h has multiple meanings it does

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,599
not really

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,280
just means the device edge or network

00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,119
edge but

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,240
how how of how much i can break my

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,200
network in such a way

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,440
that i can you know reduce the latency

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,720
of

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,240
overall network and uh

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,880
and you know process my data closure to

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,599
the network

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,480
approach to the device without choking

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,960
my

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,960
network bandwidth so to to

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,400
you know to showcase what we have uh

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,480
you know experimented so far in my lab

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,760
i'll i'll show you with demo

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,800
so idea is how do i

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,400
take care of my emergency vehicles right

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,040
in on a busy road without impacting my

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,480
traffic

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,040
and leveraging my uh federated learning

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,000
uh look this kind of an architecture so

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,359
what i say okay

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,280
let's assume there's an accident on the

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,400
road it will immediately reach out to

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,839
the server

00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,760
uh hospital server for asking for uh

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,760
uh an ambulance what

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,119
how will it do uh so technically what

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,119
i'm doing is i'm

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,240
you know reaching out to my app server

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,640
somewhere

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,960
on the cloud so it will go and talk to

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,400
my master uh traffic controller

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,320
it will run some analytics so basically

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,079
it is doing its it is doing the heavy

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,839
lifting part there and it is finding the

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,160
way for the ambulance to

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,880
go from point a to point b in a minimal

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,400
time so

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,320
what i'm doing is i'm trying right at

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,640
this point of time i'm doing all the

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,560
no algorithm running in my my cloud

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,440
cloud

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,079
server itself then i will intimidate my

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,599
uh

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,520
um hospital to you know with the

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,599
complete route to run from point a to

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,640
point b hospital will notify the

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,839
ambulance

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,440
now now here comes the important part

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,720
this is where the ambulance is

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,680
now ambulance knows i have i have to go

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,599
from point a to point b

00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:01,119
it will be not only you know

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,760
running running certain intelligence in

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,280
in

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,880
itself but it will be at the same time

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,200
it will be talking to the network

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,920
to get the current condition of the road

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,680
so that it

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,359
if it has to read out in real time it

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,760
should be able to do that

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,280
but but but at the same time what this

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,160
controller traffic controller would do

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,960
is it will try to reach out to the edge

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,960
server

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,920
for all the identified cells

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,359
in in the entire route say from point a

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,240
let's assume

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,960
sorry my cursor yeah so from here to

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,720
here

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,200
now if i have one cell it will reach out

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,880
to the cell saying okay

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,880
this is the ambulance coming your way

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,880
based on your current traffic can you

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,200
please ensure that

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,280
my uh ambulance reaches there

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,520
without any uh hundreds and it should be

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,640
able to take the fastest

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,599
route so what it does is

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,040
i run some part of my you know analytics

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,079
on my edge server

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,839
to avoid everything pushing on the

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,440
devices

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,440
i find okay this is

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,839
the current situation of my

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,839
network i have so many so many vehicles

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:19,119
on each section

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,599
and then what would it take to you know

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,320
move them around without impacting their

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,400
routes

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,359
so what will it do is it will get

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,640
certain policies from the top

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,440
now based on these policies it will go

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,240
and ask the network to increase the

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,320
bandwidth to

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,280
take care of all the messages which will

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,440
be you know

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,800
suddenly there will be certain message

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,599
because there's some sub emergency

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,480
situation

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,079
so they'll be living a lot maybe

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,839
suddenly all these devices will start

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,839
communicating

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,200
because now they are they have their

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,640
identity based on

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,240
their sensors they will be identifying

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,760
okay there is some certain

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,960
resistance uh

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,200
it will start reporting it to the

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,800
network server and it will start

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,359
reporting it to the devices

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,160
all these devices at the infrastructure

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,079
devices

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,079
so what it does is it talks to all

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,359
infrastructure devices

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,960
guide them to run some you know

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,760
algorithm locally

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,480
to identify the traffic on their

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,520
junction and

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,760
route them accordingly

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,359
so once it does it my ambulance will

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,800
reach from point a to point b

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,240
without much hindrance uh it looks much

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:35,359
easier on the screen

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,359
but but but frankly speaking uh this

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,440
algorithm we are not still able to you

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,079
know make it perfect

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,079
we're still working on this uh you know

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,640
algorithm but but but having said that

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,480
this is more of an experimental

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,400
algorithm not something that we are

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,200
vacating or something this is just to

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,800
see how i

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,520
can you know break down my processing

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,240
into three different layers i at the

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,319
cloud

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,160
at my edge at my you know devices

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,920
what would it make sense what kind of

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,280
processing would it make sense to run at

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,079
what level

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,040
so uh before i go to qa let me take a

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,079
few minutes and

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,079
quickly want to show you uh

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,079
one one video of

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,680
our simulation that we have done so you

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,880
can see on the screen

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,920
a typical city scenario and i run

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,480
i triggered an event let's say i picked

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,480
up a point

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,079
so as soon as i do that that's all this

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,319
processing happens in real time and

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,200
my emblem is on my way then now you can

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,119
see

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,119
if you have noticed uh let me stop

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,280
if you have noticed this all the lights

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,359
has turned into green

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:03,520
and the lights here on the left side are

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,839
to avoid any traffic on on

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,680
the path of the ambulance so ambulance

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,560
at this particular time it's

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,440
not only just talking to infrastructure

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,760
but if

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,720
uh if you see all these lines the bigger

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,640
lines this

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,000
so these are the lines where my vehicles

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,359
are talking to the network there's

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,200
exchanging data

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,640
a lot of data and my ambulance is also

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,960
exchanging data so

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,319
see so if you notice all these lines are

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,839
nothing but there's

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,839
a lot of communication happening between

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,839
them

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,599
so this is the pick-up point it picked

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,720
up the assume that it has picked up the

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,480
patient and it is on the way back to the

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,800
hospital so

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,760
this entire route from point a to point

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,880
b and point b

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,400
to point a it has ensure that the

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,920
traffic is minimal or

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,240
no traffic at all so that ambulance

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,160
doesn't have to slow down at all

00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,839
so there's a huge amount of crossing

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,880
being going around

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,160
in in this context within uh within uh

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,560
multiple

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,200
so coming back to the slides i think

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,839
this

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,960
this with this i would like to uh take

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,839
up all the

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,839
sorry

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,640
questions uh let me go back

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,079
to the presentation and

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,160
i was here i will stop sharing so

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,800
if you have any questions let me see if

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,800
i have any

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,240
i think i have few questions around

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,720
you're left with only five six minutes

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:44,400
but let me try to see

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,599
um the first question is from karthik

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,880
um karthik uh unfortunately no

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,520
uh the algorithm that we are working

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,400
is not going to be open source because

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,760
that is part of

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,839
uh the tcs um but

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,680
yes i am trying to work with my

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,200
management tool and my legals to see if

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,839
i can open source that

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,839
but that that will time time will take

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,839
not sure if i will be able to do that

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,000
tata vehicles i'm sure there will be but

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,520
i'm i cannot

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,520
i'm not very uh

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,480
i'm i'm not very uh confident about that

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,800
but i'm sure there will be because each

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,640
of

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,680
every every uh automotive company are

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,040
working on

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,760
auto uh you know on autonomous vehicles

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,760
but

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,640
are they using auto grid linux or not i

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,640
am not sure about that

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,640
what are the service providers for 5g

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,400
okay service provider for 5g are limited

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,880
at this point of time as i mentioned

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,640
earlier because 5g is just catching up

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,200
and you will see a lot of service

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,200
providers

00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,520
which will be coming up in in

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,160
next couple of you know years coming by

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,720
i think

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,839
ericsson would have i mean from service

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,319
providers for use

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,440
service provider would be vodafone or

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,760
atnt

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,599
or verizon they have started deploying

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,200
5g network across the world

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,960
or for that matter even if you look at

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,720
the japan rakuten is one who is

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:24,240
deploying who's deployed

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,240
uh 5k network similarly we will be uh

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,440
seeing a lot of 5g network in coming

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,319
future with the support for v2x as well

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,000
so they are implementing i know uh v2x

00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,680
in the network and they

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,480
would be supporting these kind of use

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,480
cases for sure

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,960
any projection on when we can see 5k

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,240
devices in indian market

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,720
uh i

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,240
see when you say 5g devices if you are

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,240
referring to mobile phone i think

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,560
vivo has recently launched one

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,839
in indian market and i believe there's

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,640
another one

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,920
even oneplus has launched one samsung

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,480
has launched

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,319
5v devices in india market i think a

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,560
couple of them are already there

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,319
but it will take some time uh for india

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,920
market to uh

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,800
you know adopt 5gb because as you

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,839
might have read that the spectrum is

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,599
itself is not

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,960
a sign so it will take a couple of years

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,040
before i can say ok

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,880
my indian market is fighting ready so it

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,839
will eventually that will happen but

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,839
it may take some time

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,839
okay i think we still have three minutes

00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,839
left

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:24,400
okay if no more questions i think we can

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:27,760
stop broadcasting

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,760
how do i stop broadcast

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,839
okay yeah so okay i'll wait another two

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,839
minutes before i stop broadcast

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,200
let me know if any

00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,839
questions

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,839
you

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,839
this

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,640
okay i think that's uh no more questions

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,200
i think we can stop the broadcast thank

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:53,280
you everyone for joining this session

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,520
