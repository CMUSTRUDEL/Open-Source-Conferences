hello everyone

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,040
my name is tim bird i'm a principal

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,519
software engineer at sony electronics

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,719
and

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,160
welcome to this session of um embedded

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,880
linux conference i'm going to be talking

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,320
about

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,240
issues with open source license

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,880
compliance in consumer electronics

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,480
so i usually like to put the abstract

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,199
inside the slides in case people come

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,279
along

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,880
afterwards but you can see that online

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,160
and

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,519
this is the agenda that i'm going to be

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,960
talking about today i'm going to go

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,960
through a little bit of the

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
legal disclaimer it's important for a

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,559
talk like this i'll talk about aspects

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,000
of compliance

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,399
and give a little bit of the license

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,840
history talk about some of the gotchas

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,360
that you may encounter as you're

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,440
dealing with compliance and then give

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,399
some of my own personal recommendations

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,960
so let's start with this disclaimer so

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,800
first

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
it's important to recognize that the law

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
is way different than

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,760
code and there's a lot of armchair

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,960
lawyers

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,440
out in open source but it's important to

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,199
remember

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,559
well so one i'm a software developer i'm

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,159
not a lawyer

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,840
and i'm specifically not your lawyer so

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,200
there are a lot of unexpected things in

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,159
law that unless you have legal

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,479
experience

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,799
you're not going to know about so don't

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,360
trust what you read on the internet

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,799
or even what you hear from me people

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,880
will make strong statements

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,320
about what's required by licenses but

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
it's just their opinion the same

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,640
same goes for this presentation there

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,439
are actually very few legal court

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,880
decisions

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,400
that have been made about gpl and

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,479
the language of the gpl in a couple of

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
places it's a little bit ambiguous

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,400
and some i don't know of any open source

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
license that in choose

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,799
that includes a choice of law which

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,439
means that

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,079
the it might be interpreted differently

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,360
in different

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,560
uh legal venues so and i know for a fact

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,960
that german law

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,240
in terms of licenses and contracts is uh

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,560
is a little bit different than

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
u.s law and so there's unexpected things

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
that can occur

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,159
in different jurisdictions so you should

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,439
always check with your own company legal

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,799
counsel when you're making

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,879
decisions that you think might have some

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
legal risk and

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,560
it's really important for me to let you

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,200
know these are

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,319
my views i am not speaking on behalf of

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720
sony corporation

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,080
uh even though i've got the logo on my

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,280
slides

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,599
these are my viewpoints and so

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
let me get started part of the reason

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
for this talk is because i do have some

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,760
pet peeves

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,840
i've i've been doing linux for over 25

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
years now and i hear this a lot

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
on forums and stuff it's trivial to

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,239
comply with the license just post the

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
source code

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,680
you know what what's the big deal well

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
it's

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,599
actually not as trivial as it sounds so

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,640
that works when you have an in-house

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,319
product and you're in

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,000
complete control of all the source top

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,080
to bottom and that's true for

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
some products but there's a lot of other

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
products where

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,120
you're getting components from other

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
places and uh it just doesn't

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,400
uh in particular with large products

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
like a mobile phone

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
uh i think the last time we there's one

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,159
product that sony

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
uh that i measured the code on we had 58

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,440
million lines of code

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,640
it came from multiple vendors and in

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,239
case of a mobile phone you're talking

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,640
about code from google

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,680
uh mediatek or qualcomm and sony and

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,319
there are a bunch of others in the

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
supply chain

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,000
providing software for drivers and and

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,959
sometimes black box

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
components that go inside the product so

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,920
it's not

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,599
it's not as simple as having all of the

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
code just in-house

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,599
and there are some business units that

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,200
that do black box or what we call

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,200
white label products i'm aware of some

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,360
old security cameras that were

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,000
just relabeled by the vendor and they'd

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,319
come from a completely separate vendor

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,760
and some business units are are not in

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,120
the software business per se so sony b2b

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,959
is a business unit that does uh ip

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,080
and av suites for stadium stadium

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,000
packages for stadium suites and so

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,519
they do not have the same level of

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
expertise as like system level

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,640
developers

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,000
inside some of the other sony product

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,000
teams so it's

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,439
it's much more complicated than than

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
people kind of

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,840
assert but having said that let's talk

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,799
about what is required so

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
these are the aspects of license

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,600
compliance

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
you have to know what's in your product

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
i'm going to talk about what types of

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
things you have to provide

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,840
and some of the requirements around

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,520
those so let's get into that

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,880
the first thing and this is really

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,080
important is you got to know

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,479
what's in your product if you're dealing

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,600
with

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,840
a large product by large i mean lots of

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
lines of code lots of components

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,040
then you can expect to maintain a

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,000
spreadsheet possibly with thousands of

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,960
lines of rows

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,720
now most people will look at a package

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,919
the list of packages on a website

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,919
and say well there's not that many

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
packages it's like well but there are

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,120
that many files and

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
the license granularity is not

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,520
necessarily at the granularity of

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
the package so you have to know what's

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,160
inside your

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,639
your product there are tools to assist

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,840
with this

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,360
both commercial and open source and you

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,280
can go look at those there's

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,000
lots of resources to find out about

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,720
those and and how to use those

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,960
i have found in my experience that most

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,880
often the problem comes from suppliers

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,639
so there are some suppliers out there

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
who do not take their responsibilities

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,600
seriously

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,199
and there's a working group in the linux

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,240
foundation

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,600
called open chain and they focus on

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,120
education and certification so um

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
there's a standard and it's actually an

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
iso standard it's either

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,960
it's already been approved or it's on

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,639
track to be approved but for open source

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,240
processes within a company

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,160
and and this is really important because

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
as products become more complex

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,919
uh you're getting uh software and

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,759
hardware for more and more suppliers

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,199
and all it takes is one supplier to kind

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,720
of screw it up uh

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,280
in in your supply chain and so um

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,479
we're as sony we're a platinum member of

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,120
open chain we're

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,039
uh very interested in seeing that this

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,280
education and these processes

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,319
methods uh that improve open source

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,080
compliance are

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
are used throughout the industry i think

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,039
it helps not just us but it helps

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,720
helps the entire industry um so

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,240
first thing is you got to know what's in

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
your product uh

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
for it in order to do this it's very

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,479
helpful if

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,680
you can actually build what you get from

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,360
your supplier so that

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
is interesting sometimes the software is

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,479
embedded

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,000
and so deeply embedded and

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,039
and so it's not you can't do this 100 of

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,880
the time but it's

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,080
useful if you can validate the source

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,600
that's provided to you

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,759
and that that matches the binaries on

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,120
your component um

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
so some of the one of the things that

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,479
you have to do is you have to provide

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,800
what we call attribution

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,199
and most licenses even even permissive

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,080
ones like mit or bsd

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,960
require that you give someone notice

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,000
about

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,240
the presence of that software and the

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,599
possibly the copyright or the authors

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,800
somewhere in the product text

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,479
and some some licenses require this uh

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,319
to only accompany the source

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,240
uh and others require that it accompany

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,880
the product um

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,520
uh what most well and so it used to be

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,000
that we just put stuff on a paper manual

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
uh but as we've been used more and more

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
open source

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,919
it's gotten way too long for that so um

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
here's some of the requirements for

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,919
different licenses

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,759
uh different licenses like mit or bsd

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,680
require stuff either

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,880
to accompany the source or they require

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,599
that it accompany the

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,800
the binaries which means the product um

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,800
bsd4

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
actually required that you give notice

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
in the advertising materials

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,720
uh that is a super obnoxious clause that

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,680
um the actually the whole industry kind

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,440
of worked hard to

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
eliminate that i don't think you'll find

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,199
much bsd4

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,160
license software out there but that's an

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,919
example of

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,319
you know there's a big variety of places

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,039
where this these requirements

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,680
uh required you to put place put things

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,000
um

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,960
and so in order to simplify things most

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
companies

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,560
uh will just gather everything uh the

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
licenses

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,240
the attributions the copyrights licenses

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,680
and they'll put it on a single page in

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
the device

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,240
and that's accessible by a menu item and

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,680
so if you look on your own phone

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,840
an experi i have xperia phone here so

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,520
if you look under about and legal

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,280
information on your phone you'll see

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,440
this huge long screen in fact

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,440
the scroll bar i think is only one pixel

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,039
big it's or two pixels it's

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,880
it's hard actually to get to the scroll

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,479
bar but and um

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,159
but you have all this information it's

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,440
included with the product now

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,800
so what happens if you have a product

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
that has no display

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,080
and there are some products that have no

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,560
paper docs either

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,360
and there are even some products that

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,560
have no display

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,920
no paper docs and no packaging

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,680
so what people do and i'm not uh i'm not

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,959
going to make any judgment about whether

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,519
this is sufficient or not but what

00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,200
people

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,440
i've seen people do is they put a web

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
link either on the product packaging if

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,160
it has packaging or if there's no

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,080
product packaging i've heard of people

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,880
describing a web link on the product

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,760
itself

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,440
so i think in that case that's about as

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,279
well as you can do

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
and then of course at that link whatever

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,839
the website is you have to keep that

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
website up and you have to have the

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,800
information

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
all the relevant information there the

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
other thing that you have to provide

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,000
is you have to provide source code or

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,440
an offer for source so the gpl gives two

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,880
options for this so let's let's talk

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,200
about those two options

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,240
so one of the things you can do is

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
provide

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
the actual source code with the product

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,200
itself so the gpl

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,720
says accompany it with the complete

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,839
corresponding machine readable source

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,760
code

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
on a medium customarily used for

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,279
software interchange

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,360
so some of your options here you could

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,839
include physical media like a usb stick

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,080
or

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,040
a cd-rom and i've actually seen examples

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,519
of this and

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,800
and those are fine some some products

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,880
you can actually put it on the internal

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,200
storage in the product itself

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,959
and uh this is an interesting option it

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,360
does solve some issues

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,640
uh it makes certain other things easier

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
so you don't have to create a download

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,839
site you don't have to keep it populated

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,200
for a period of time

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,200
you don't have to do physical

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
fulfillment after the fact once you've

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,839
done it

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,600
in the product you don't have to you

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,680
don't have to

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,200
keep doing it in the in the future and

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,200
you don't have to give the

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
software to anyone who asks for it you

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,160
only have to give it to your product

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,279
recipients it's kind of baked into your

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,959
product delivery

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,040
the reason that this is not used very

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,760
often there's a couple of reasons one

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,760
there are products that don't have

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,200
sufficient internal storage

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
right we are talking about embedded

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,200
products here deeply embedded

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,399
uh but even even then if you're going to

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
do firmware updates

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,000
uh you're gonna do those over the air

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,320
you can't be shipping a usb stick or a

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,560
new cd-rom with every firmware update

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,360
so there are size issues even if you

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
wanted to

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,880
kind of include the source with the cbd

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,760
update so

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,959
ultimate ultimately this is a solution

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
that is not used very often in the

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,640
industry so the other solution

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
is to provide an offer for source

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
instead of the source itself you provide

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,640
an offer

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,560
and the wording of the gpl here is

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,839
accompany it with a written offer valid

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,760
for at least three years

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,040
to give any third party for a charge no

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,560
more than your cost of physically

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,720
performing source revision

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
a complete machine readable copy of the

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
corresponding source code

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
on a medium customarily used for

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,240
software interchange

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,560
and that last part is kind of key so

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,040
most community members

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,920
feel like an internet download site is

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,959
sufficient

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,040
uh however i've talked to a fair number

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,560
of lawyers and most lawyers

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
believe that this should be interpreted

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
that language should be interpreted as

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,720
the medium

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
used for software interchange in 1999

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,640
when the license was written

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,000
so offering only on the internet is not

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
sufficient

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,480
so an offer of a cd or something maybe a

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,200
mag tape i don't know that would be rude

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,440
is is required and then i want to take a

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,160
little segue here

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,639
so it it but it varies so different

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,800
venues may interpret this differently

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,399
um so the i already said the licenses

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,040
don't include a choice of law

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,279
so something that may be made a decision

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,720
in one country may not apply in another

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,959
country but if you're dealing with a

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,200
large multinational corporation which i

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
am with sony you have to look at all the

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,079
different countries

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,680
the license can be interpreted in

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,079
different countries actually in germany

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,760
there is case law there was a court case

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,200
that said you must provide the option to

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,760
obtain physical media

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,279
um so there's a legal precedent there

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,000
and german courts have taken

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,839
the gpl seriously including uh details

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,639
about the source offer so you have to be

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,959
careful

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,560
i just want to take just a tiny bit of a

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,600
segue here or

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,519
a detour certain effects of

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,639
or features of german law were used by

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,160
one litigant

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,839
to gain a lot of money with a particular

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,399
legal strategy

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
so and i'm not going to go into the

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,200
details of that

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
i have a resource page at the end of

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
these slides that has information about

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,519
that case it was the litigant was

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,560
his name was patrick mccarty and the

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,519
bottom line there

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,320
is don't sign any consent agreements or

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,760
compliance agreements in germany without

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
consulting a lawyer and reading up on

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,040
the strategy there um

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,519
the anyway i'll just leave it at that

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,639
so there are places where you need to be

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,240
careful

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
uh with your interpretation and your

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,360
fulfillment of the license requirements

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,120
and then even within a single country

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
you can have uh

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
different contributors to a project who

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,920
interpret

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,240
uh the license differently so um

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,959
so it's it's it's not as clear-cut you

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
know

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,040
fulfilling all the requirements is not

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,120
as clear-cut as a lot of people say

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,440
um in terms of duration so how long do

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,079
you have to offer the source code well

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,519
it's not three so you have to offer from

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,320
three years for the last shipment of the

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,920
binary

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,440
so you're distributing a binary to

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,000
someone and it's three years

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,360
from from that date um but that's not

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,880
the last shipment of the product if you

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
do over there updates you're going to be

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,000
providing

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,839
updated firmware and that's going to um

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
be another distribution of the binary

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,800
and it and it doesn't mean

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,639
three years from the date that you last

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,800
put the firmware on your website

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,920
it's three years from last from the time

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,680
someone last

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,040
downloaded the firmware so the firmware

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,000
could be up there a really long time

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,079
even after the lifetime

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,680
of the product you have to keep

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,000
providing software

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,920
uh so that people can obtain it within

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
three years after so this is usually

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,880
however

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
after having said all that it's usually

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,079
not a big problem

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,760
there's virtually no incentive for

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,399
companies to take software off their

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
sites

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,279
and stuff just hangs around a long time

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
so technically you could be removing

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,680
stuff

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
uh but most people don't do it so the

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,839
duration is not that big of a deal

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,519
and then i'll just make one observation

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,079
uh if someone is asking you

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,240
for physical media uh they are most

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,360
likely a person who has more interest

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,639
in uh your compliance uh

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,839
and how you're doing with that than they

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,120
do with the source because if your

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,959
source is out on the internet site

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,160
that's easier for people to obtain

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,880
so i just a red flag handle requests for

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,320
source

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,880
uh promptly and carefully um

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,480
so now to the source itself what must

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,000
the source include so

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,399
for um the gpl license

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,480
which is the main license that requires

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,399
uh people to distribute source

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,000
says for an executable work complete

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,680
source code means all the source code

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,920
for all modules it contains plus any

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,600
associated interface definition files

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,279
plus the scripts used to control

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
compilation and installation of the

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,000
executable

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
so there's a term used elsewhere in the

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,279
license and by most lawyers there's an

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,040
acronym that's used

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,320
complete and corresponding source code

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:42,000
or ccs you'll hear that for short

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,600
so the gpl also says the source code for

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,759
work means the preferred form of the

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
work for making modifications for it so

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,639
that means you cannot

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,519
deliver obfuscated code uh and it needs

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,920
to be something that

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,000
actually can be worked with by a human

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,800
in terms of modifying it and rebuilding

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,480
it

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,839
and it's unfortunate but i actually have

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,800
seen examples of

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,320
a supplier providing obfuscated code i'm

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,519
not going to name names

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,560
because they they came clean and

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,279
and provided uh unobfuscated code later

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,120
so

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,360
uh we're we treat that as an anomaly um

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,320
but you you should not do it it should

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
be something that

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,320
some a developer can actually use now

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,639
about rebuilding so

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,720
you does the definition of ccs require

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,920
that a recipient can reproduce binaries

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,279
exactly

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,399
and i would argue no uh so

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,279
it's very difficult to re reproduce

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,680
binary in exact form in fact there's a

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,440
whole

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,839
there's a whole um not industry but

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,000
there's

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,680
a whole uh movement to try to do

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
reproduce builds and this has been a

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
source subject for decades so i think

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,759
that's too high of a bar

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,639
to require of a vendor um

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,160
does it does the definition of ccs

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,399
require distribution of compilers

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,160
linkers ides or proprietary tools

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,519
no it it does not you don't have to

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,600
provide the compiler

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,880
uh you don't have to provide the any

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,959
proprietary tools

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,919
it does raise an interesting question in

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,839
in my opinion

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,919
and and i'm not going to talk about this

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,520
a lot but is it compliant to use

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,720
proprietary tools to build open source

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,720
software so can i use

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,280
a a commercial tool chain yes you can

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,439
you can use a commercial tool chain

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,199
but you can keep doing this thought

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,799
experiment for longer and say well is it

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,480
compliant to use tools that are

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,200
unavailable to the public can i make my

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,679
own tool

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,400
and use that i'm not even going to get

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,640
into that i

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,320
i don't know it's never been tested to

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,600
my knowledge and uh

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,600
and people don't actually even talk

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,240
about it but

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,080
having said all that my view is that

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,480
what is required is the scripts used to

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,320
control compilation and installation

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,400
and this means auto tools configure

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,360
scripts config files and makes files and

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,880
that's sufficient for most packages

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,600
now another issue that comes up

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,600
sometimes is reinstalling

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
because the license requires scripts

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,280
used to control dot

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,240
dot installation it has that phrase in

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
it some people

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,679
interpret that to mean that you need to

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,000
be able to

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,960
install the software on a particular

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,200
device

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,000
so license does not actually say that it

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,320
doesn't mention

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,720
the act of installation or the target of

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,240
installation it just says the script

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
used for installation and i'll talk a

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,640
little bit

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,640
about that so industry practice

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,160
in fact fully supports the use of gpl

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,880
software in

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,400
read-only memory or rom so you can put

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,160
gpl software in a rom

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,799
where it cannot be uh reinstalled

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,000
in place on the same device that it was

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,440
delivered on

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
and that's been a practice that's been

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,039
supported and and uh

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,440
there are even quotes uh about

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,960
gpl reinstallation not applying in that

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,840
case so

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,480
i don't think the license requires

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,919
reinstalling

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
so if you go back and look at the

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,160
license history

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
it's pretty interesting so bsd licenses

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,280
kind of came into

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,679
effect around 1988 gpl

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,640
actually v version one came out in 89

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,200
and it was a

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,480
generalization of the emacs license that

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,880
richard salman had been

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,880
applying to some of the software in the

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,000
gnu

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,039
suite or the gnu project and the history

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
is pretty interesting

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,600
uh gpl v2 was released in 91 and was

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,120
adopted by linus torvalds

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,160
and then gpl v3

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,280
there were some perceived flaws in

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,200
gpl v2 and richard salman and others

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,400
worked on a new release of gpl that came

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
out in 2007

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,760
there was a long discussion period on

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,720
that several years

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,000
and for very a variety of reasons

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,120
including

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,919
not really agreeing with some of the

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,480
intent behind the license uh gpl v3 was

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,360
not

00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,039
ever adopted by the linux kernel and so

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
i want to talk here about interpreting

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,000
the license i think it's important

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,679
because

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,360
at this point people will start talking

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,520
about well what is the what is the

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,280
intent of the license and first

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,440
the overriding legal principle is that

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,320
the intent only matters if the license

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,240
is unclear

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,559
so a license does not have its own tent

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,720
it is not a sentient being

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,559
license is an expression of the intent

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
of the copyright owners of the software

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,240
and

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,320
it's not it may reflect the intent of

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,880
the author of the license

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,840
but that's not the person who is making

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,360
the agreement

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
uh it's the copyright owners of the

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,000
software who are making the agreement so

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,280
the problem comes up with linux and with

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
other projects that have multiple

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,520
authors as well who

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,679
who whose intent matters um

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,200
is it the leaders of the project is it

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,400
anyone uh

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,440
the linux kernel now has about 14 000

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,760
contributors so i'm sure that there's

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,960
probably a bell curve of different

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,320
intents

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,159
for how the license should be

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,039
interpreted

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
and but i will i will say this so linus

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,679
torbald's intent for the kernel

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,400
is very clear uh he has said on numerous

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,960
times

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,400
that the intent is tit for tat and that

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,919
expression means that i give you

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
something you give me the same thing

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,480
back

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,640
so if i give you source code you give me

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,240
source code back and again that's been

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,159
linus has said that a number of times in

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
a number of different venues

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,400
and i think that's uh so i believe that

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,919
that is his intent i've seen other

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,679
leading kernel developers agree with

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,840
that interpretation

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,200
so what are the license requirements

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,960
again this is my view

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,880
i'm not speaking on behalf of sony

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,760
corporation but my view is you give

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,520
people the source

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,840
all of the source including make files

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,120
configure scripts config files

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,520
customers should be able to build the

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,679
software but there's no requirement to

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,679
exactly reproduce what you've built

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,840
and there's no requirement to reinstall

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,440
on a particular device so if we have

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,320
if if a vendor has made fixes to bash

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,280
and you think those fixes are good you

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,360
can

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,600
apply them to your version of bash and

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,960
use it on your desktop or anywhere else

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,320
uh if we've put a driver in for for a

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,440
chipset or a

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,200
feature on a chip and

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,280
then you can take that feature and use

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,360
it on the phone of your own making

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,200
so vendors are not required in my

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,760
opinion to produce hardware that can run

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,760
binaries

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,360
that are produced by third parties so

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,600
bottom line

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,559
i believe secure product lockdown is

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,120
allowed by gpl v2 and i don't think i'm

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,440
alone

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,600
in that requirement interpretation of

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,520
the requirement

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:42,880
so gplv2 gplv3 came about

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,520
because of uh

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
because of that interpretation i believe

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,480
so

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,000
if you look at gplv3 really the

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,400
requirements there sought to impede

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,360
lockdown and change the terms

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,000
and gpl v3 does actually require keys to

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,159
install

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,480
the software on certain products and

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,919
most ce vendors including sony strongly

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,679
avoid gpl v3

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
uh for this reason there are a couple of

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,720
different views about that one is that

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,600
the gpl v2

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,520
had that intent all along and the

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,240
changes in gpl v3 are just changing the

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,960
wording to

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,440
to strengthen that but another view is

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,400
well

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,520
if the gpl view if gplv2 incorporated

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,280
that requirement you wouldn't need to

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,480
change the wording so the gpl v3 is a

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,640
different license

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,080
and there are some people very clearly

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,760
some people who have been vocal

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,280
that that was not their intent to

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,280
disallow lockdown

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,039
so take that for what it's worth

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
and the final thing here is that many

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,679
projects adopted

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,240
uh the linux kernel and gpl uh

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,000
software based on the wording of gpl v2

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,600
and not of gpl v3 so

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,360
you can't hold them i don't think it's

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,000
fair to hold them

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,200
to to the standard of gpl v3 or to the

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,080
requirements of gpl

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,760
v3 and even richard stallman has said

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,159
it's evil to

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,440
change the terms of the deal and expect

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,880
people to

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,799
abide by a different license than what

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,400
they agreed to

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,000
so now i want to talk a little bit about

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,640
gotchas uh there

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,520
are some nuances uh that can come in and

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,480
bite you

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,200
um so what happens is languages change

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
over time

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,799
and projects change over time these are

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,400
two sources

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,840
of things that you really have to watch

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,400
out for so

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,159
mpl stands for mozilla public license

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
and over time it changed its wording

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
slightly

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,960
and so as a vendor if you're using mpl

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,799
software you need to pay attention to

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
the version that's on the

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,080
uh the the license that's on the version

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,200
of the code that you're using

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,919
the version of the license on the

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,840
version of the code you're using mpl 2.0

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,760
has a complete and corresponding source

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,400
code warning that's more similar to the

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,400
gpl

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,520
an mpl one one one does not

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,080
also well and similar issue with gpl v2

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,919
to gplv3 so there are packages out there

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,080
that are widely used packages

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,679
um and these are this particular one is

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
owned by the free software foundation

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,320
that was

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,039
originally written under gpl v2 but then

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,919
switched licensed his gpl v3

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,320
and and it's not the packages themselves

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,240
you

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,679
you can go back and find those old

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,360
versions of the packages but

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,720
the interesting issue comes up with what

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,320
about

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,120
patches to that project so for instance

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,279
there's a very

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,200
interesting and useful patch to plug a

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,320
security vulnerability in bash called

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,080
shell shock

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,320
and the patch for that was submitted

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,799
simultaneously by the same person or

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,240
same

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:36,080
organization to version 4.3 of g

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,960
of bash which was gpl v3 and version 3.2

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,640
of bash which was

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,039
gpl v2 so what is the license of that

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,400
patch well i would say

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,000
it's the license the project it was

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,240
contributed to but it gets more

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,520
complicated than that so

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,720
you can envision places where people are

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,080
extracting patches from

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,840
versions of the software that have a

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,640
different license and are they

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,679
you know can they be accepted in back

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,559
ports

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,919
so there's a lot of factors to that um

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,880
that's something that you really need to

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,799
look out for

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,320
so just be really really careful in

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:15,520
handling of any packages that are gpl v2

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,279
that you know have switched to a

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,960
different license

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,559
and then there's another example there

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,159
are other examples where

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:27,200
it's not it's not trivial to

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,679
figure out the license for all of the

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,840
outputs from a package so for instance

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,919
in util linux ng

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,760
it's mostly gpl v2 and if you look at

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,080
the copying file that's at the top of

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,919
the

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,200
the source code directory that says

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,919
gplv2

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,039
i think it may now say gplv2 and some

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,039
other stuff

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,240
but you have to go look at the headers

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,279
that are on individual files because

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,799
there are a couple of files that are

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,279
actually gplv3 so you

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,600
it's uh you have to be paying attention

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,799
and looking closely at this stuff

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,799
make sure you don't get caught

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,520
so this is this is the part of the

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,799
presentation

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,520
well i i'll just unlockability

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,440
in my opinion is not required by gpl v2

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,120
but i think it's a topic that

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,240
um a lot of companies ce companies are

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,039
interested in

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,480
and there's a lot of discussion in the

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,919
industry about it so i'm going to talk

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,279
about it anyway

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:26,480
at my own legal and reputational

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,960
peril um so you can have there's a

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,279
spectrum of unlockability right so you

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,360
can have a fully unlocked product

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,559
a not unlockable product which is a

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,240
lockdown product

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,559
put in more positive terms with a double

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,399
negative or you can have something that

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,120
you can unlock and reinstall the oss

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,039
only so let me talk about those

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,039
a fully unlocked product is something

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,640
where okay and

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,240
i'm talking about kind of a specific

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,279
class of products that

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,080
have uh the ability to stream content

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,520
and or and or the ability to connect to

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,200
a backend service so

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,480
i'm not talking about some little iot

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,760
device that doesn't have a whole bunch

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,559
of other considerations that's like i

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,240
got a 100

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,320
open source stack that's that's not what

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,679
i'm talking about i'm talking about a

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,000
product with a mixed

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,120
stack consisting of proprietary and open

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,520
source software

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,320
so a fully unlocked product would mean

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,760
uh

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,799
that um that you you can reinstall all

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,880
of the software

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,880
and retain all all the keys and connect

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,720
the back-end services okay so first

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,960
this is not required by any open source

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,840
license including gpl v3

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,159
so open source licenses only cover

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
software

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,360
that is open source it doesn't cover the

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,799
proprietary software or the

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,720
or the streaming keys or the back end

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,559
keys those are not those are not part of

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,640
the open source

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,320
and for some products not for all of

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,600
them but for some products it's simply

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,320
not supportable as a business

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,240
proposition

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,480
and so the example i'll give out here is

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,520
video game consoles and network play

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,760
so if you can unlock the product and and

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,520
you can alter the operating system

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,840
then trust me you can figure out a way

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,240
to cheat in online game play

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,360
and that's kind of the reason that

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,480
people do this

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,320
um and so

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,840
that is an example of a product where

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,279
it's

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,240
the the ecosystem relies on there being

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,399
a protection of the capabilities of the

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,200
individual nodes on the network

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,960
or to make it fair for other players and

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,320
so that's part of the reason people buy

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,440
the software is when they do network

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,080
play they don't want

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,480
people to be playing unfairly so it's

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,200
actually kind of baked into

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,039
the the whole business model and and

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,679
what customers want

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,360
so a fully unlocked product i think is

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,919
unrealistic it only works in a world of

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,760
perfect

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,080
and honest actors and that is

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,000
unfortunately not the world we live in

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,279
so let's talk about the opposite end of

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,120
the spectrum which is

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,880
most ce companies lock down the product

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,440
and just don't look back

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,240
and so you can argue whether that's good

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,159
or bad but

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,240
the security for this type of thing is

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,880
often done in multiple layers

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,480
you've got encryption uh for the update

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,279
images themselves the things that are

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,279
transferred

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,200
from the back end over the air to the

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,399
the product for updating you've got

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,640
on the device you've got trusted

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,760
execution rings and trusted predicted

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,919
modules

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,559
uh they're holding the secret keys and

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,919
stuff you've got encrypted file systems

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,279
and then you've got kernel module and

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,440
application signing so everything's

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,520
verified before it starts

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,360
so these products are really locked down

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,320
hard because

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,440
the industry has shown itself well uh

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,039
certain

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
sectors of the consumers of these

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,320
products have shown themselves to be uh

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,240
pretty agile

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,320
at breaking in and doing stuff um

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,919
but there are counter examples right so

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,200
uh i know that there are some

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,600
experienced phones

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,360
uh that are unlockable and some google

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,399
pixel phones not all of the phones but

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,520
some of them

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,360
uh so it is possible to to do

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,880
uh some level of unlocking you don't

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,399
have to

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,159
lock everything up and so this is a

00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,919
a product i'm going to describe here

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,080
that allows you to

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,799
unlock the product and reinstall only

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,279
the open source software

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,919
and a couple of notes about this so this

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,000
does

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,480
give consumers the ability to modify

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,559
install modified open source software

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,159
while at the same time protects the

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,559
interests of the content industry and

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,679
consumers who want to stream content

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,919
if you if you uh anyway so there's no

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,360
obligation to make proprietary software

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,960
work with open source software that's

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,919
not in any license

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,440
uh and so what that means is uh you may

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,320
require the removal

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,919
or disabling of proprietary software uh

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,080
what that ends up doing is

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,760
so the device once you've unlocked it

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,480
like this you may lose quite a bit of

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,159
functionality

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,440
depending on the stack it's heavily

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,039
dependent on what items are in your

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,320
stack

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,840
so uh the customer the bottom line is

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,360
customer demand for this is very low

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,080
this is not your average consumer that's

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,760
trying to

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,919
to break into their tv set or their

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,720
phone or or whatever or their streaming

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,039
device

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,240
uh because the customer demand is low

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,360
it's a very hard sell

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,880
to your business unit i and so um

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,960
as there's just not enough um

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,159
you know customers to make it

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,880
interesting uh

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,000
to do the uh difficult engineering work

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,799
involved

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,080
this can be a one-way action that's most

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,799
often how it's done

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,960
is that once you unlock the product you

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,760
can't re-lock it again and get back

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,960
those proprietary software those content

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,720
keys

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,000
that is actually technically very very

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,840
difficult once you've removed the

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,039
content keys there are some places

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,880
in those layers of security where um

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,080
right once operations are performed so

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
you can only

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,760
you can't actually rewrite the

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,880
encryption keys for some flash devices

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,720
for example

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,960
so um okay so having said all that

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,880
uh let me let me just dive into what i

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,399
recommend so this is kind of the summary

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,240
wrap up portion here

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,480
uh these are the kind of main things

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,640
that you need to think about

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,080
and what i recommend you do so first in

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,919
terms of communication

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,519
please please please communicate with

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,919
your upstream suppliers and do it in

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,519
advance don't do it as an afterthought

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,200
get your suppliers involved with open

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,000
chain the open chain project make sure

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,600
they have processes

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,399
in place i it is sad but i'm aware

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,360
of several major vendors who have had

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,919
what i call

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,880
oh crud moments where they found out a

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,919
supplier

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,519
was not giving them the right stuff or

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,399
was not giving them any stuff

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,000
and and that's a really uh awkward and

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,720
difficult situation for a vendor to get

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,840
into

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,360
so some of the ideas i have are you can

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,159
put penalties in place in your

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,240
procurement

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,080
contracts again this is for kind of

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,880
large suppliers who have

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,480
procurement contracts uh for you can put

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,600
penalties for failure to disclose open

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,399
source software or

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,919
you can require permission um in advance

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,039
to deliver components with open source

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,279
software there's a couple different ways

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,880
to deal with that

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,559
i think it's good if you can get a

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,080
license manifest

00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,600
that talks about all the files on your

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,360
device and

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,039
try and get the license for every single

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,480
file again

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,079
don't do don't don't do this as an

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,159
afterthought don't have this be

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,679
during your qa of your product you're

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,520
assembling all this information try to

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,480
get it up front

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,960
another thing that you can try i don't

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,720
think very many companies do this

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,159
and i'm not going to assert that sony

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,079
does it in all cases

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,760
but you can try to build what you get

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,520
from your supplier

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,280
ask that your source be accompanied with

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,320
a script that does a start to finish

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,720
build

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,480
and one of the things you find is that

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,159
products have a lifetime if product has

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,000
lifetime of five to ten years the build

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,119
environment changes substantially over

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,359
that time or what's the

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,720
kind of the current distro and so it

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,159
becomes obsolete and very hard to

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,320
reproduce so i recommend

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,240
a docker file to capture things like the

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,159
host os the tool chains and other

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,639
programs

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,200
and if you have an internal team if you

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,440
could have

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,879
another team besides that team kind of

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,720
test out the build

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,480
this is highly aspirational i'm not

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,520
saying anybody does this now but i think

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,000
this would be a good thing for the

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,760
industry to move towards

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,680
and then in source availability this is

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,240
pretty obvious make an internet download

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,520
site where

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,520
people can obtain the source for your

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,599
products and uh

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,119
there are some people who sometimes play

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,119
games with only trying to allow just

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,680
customers to get to it

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,280
but i don't i don't see a reason for

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,359
that just make the source code available

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
to all

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,640
and then you do need an offer for

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,160
physical media

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,520
you won't get much traffic you won't

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,079
have to find yourself burning a lot of

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,680
cds

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,200
but you should make sure you have one

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,920
and that it works

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,440
in terms of unlockability in my view

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,359
unlocking your product is not required

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,119
by gplv2

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,680
so but it does make community members

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,880
and

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,079
customers happy um and so you may

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,400
decide that you want to do that there

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,440
are there are good reasons to

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,000
make an unlockable product uh and

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,680
so in the independent of what your view

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,720
is of the license requirements

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,320
if you support unlocking then if you

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,839
handle back-end services or streaming

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,800
content anything protected you'll have

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,079
to figure out a way to

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,880
to deal with that and it's more

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,440
difficult than it sounds

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,320
if you don't support reinstallation you

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,680
must

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,800
avoid gpl v3 software that's my opinion

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,160
so uh final statements so first

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,480
i hope i haven't scared you with all

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,800
this talk it sounds like a lot of work

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
and

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,000
and there are there are some eyes to dot

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,240
and

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,839
t's to cross but it is possible so

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,079
people people have been doing this for

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,440
many years compliance with the license

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,599
is required it's not like it's an

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,520
optional thing it's part of

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,960
it's part of the payment that you're

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,320
making for the open source that you

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,760
received you've gotten an awful lot of

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,079
value as a vendor

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,760
uh from open source software from the

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,640
developers to put time and effort into

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,079
it and

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,119
giving back to them what they ask for is

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,359
is appropriate and uh and legal

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,160
um it's it's not trivial but it is

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,040
achievable

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,640
and then i again i'm gonna make my

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,520
disclaimer at the end here due to legal

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,400
uncertainty

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,920
um make sure you make decisions uh based

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,599
on kind of knowledge of the risk and

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,119
with your own company's

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,720
uh legal team uh and then my last thing

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,000
is a plug for the open chain prime you

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
really should check out the open chain

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,960
project

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,839
and i have a little four-leaf clover

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,240
here on

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,599
on here so uh i hope that the

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,800
information this presentation has been

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,280
useful to you

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,440
and uh that you will benefit from it and

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,880
good luck in your compliance activities

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,800
and hope to see you around the industry

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,839
so with that i will go ahead and take

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,839
some questions

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,119
