welcome to this session

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,799
in this session we would like to talk

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,639
about

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,160
aga production readiness profile

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:18,720
that is new hdl ioi activity

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,720
focusing on the product adaption

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,519
this presentation consists of the

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,080
following six parts

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,880
i'll start with the background and then

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,760
talk about

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,040
the issue when adapting hdl to actual

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,840
products

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,680
and i'll talk about production readiness

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
profile

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,960
that is the activity for the purpose of

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,719
filling the gap between

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,120
current agr and idea product in the

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,120
market

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
then i'll introduce some automotive

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,079
requirements and function

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,079
those are included in production radius

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
i'll also introduce the roadmap of this

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,560
activity next

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,479
and finally i wrap up my presentation

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,240
with call to action

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,920
oh by the way present and

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,479
it looks like

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,479
you should continue listening my

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
presentation

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,200
oh someone can kill my voice but

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,360
it's just something that's what i'm not

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,160
sure what's going on

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
but uh

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,040
please let me continue

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
this session is co-hosted by toyota and

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,800
denzel

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
and i'll hand it over to nishikistan

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,879
from

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,000
denzel during the section 4.

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:51,840
so this is some

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:51,840
i'll continue my presentation and

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,280
please prepare you are setting

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,840
by the time i hand it to you

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,840
sorry

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,680
so before starting the contents

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,480
uh please let me introduce myself

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
briefly

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,400
my name is mitsuo tate i'm a software

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,400
engineer in toyota

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,239
my background is not always automotive

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,599
rather i have more experiences in the

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,760
deaf center side

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,040
such as data storage and current

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,879
restoration

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,799
but currently i'm in charge of

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,840
developing ibs system

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,840
and agreeing filter looks like

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
exercise

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
as you can see

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,840
as a background or production readiness

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,840
profile

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,239
i'd like to i'd like to introduce

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,919
how further having working with agr

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,199
and current state of aga from

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:37,440
oregon point of view to

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:40,320
improve the presence of adr toyota

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,280
have been developing pocs and

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,479
demonstrating

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,240
applications such as window managers and

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,759
home screen and we have

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:57,840
presented them in areas and ces last

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,840
year for example

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
thanks to the contribution from many

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,080
companies

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,360
and community members ngo membership

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
have been grown to more than

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,080
140 companies now

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,039
that is great however we when we look at

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,560
the status of

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,120
product adoption by oems only a few

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,440
cases

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,840
are publicly announced as far as we know

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
there are three announcements from oem

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,720
one of them is dirt as an

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,080
enhancement in 2017. so

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:43,520
we think agile membership is growing

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,520
but product adaption is still low

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:55,840
from total point of view can not

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,080
use agr for their product easily the

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,280
main reason is because

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,240
current agr doesn't meet oems require

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,680
product requirements such as automotive

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,120
specific requirements

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,319
or quality of codes and so on

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,680
on the other hand again cannot meet such

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,720
product requirements

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,080
because they are not very defined

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,520
nor contributed by audience

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,400
so to break this situation we think

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,400
the contribution of product requirements

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,319
from oem sites

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,360
or tier one site is necessary

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,880
how started disclosing

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,160
our source code product source code and

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:49,840
started the activity to discuss what the

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,840
product requirement is for ibi

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,560
this activity is called production

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,120
readiness

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,599
and the source code is disclosed to

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,840
production readiness profile

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:09,520
so what is production radiance profile

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:12,880
it's a it's a part of ibi project inside

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,520
many aga projects and it's a new

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,919
platform

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,520
where product original idea requirements

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,199
and the implementation

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:27,199
are disclosed we think this profile can

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,880
be used as product level reference

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,360
after the discussion within the

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,639
community directed source code and

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,880
requirement from

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,080
production readiness will be modular

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:45,840
into mainline

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:45,840
agl that is called library profile

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,560
then from this slide i'd like to

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,680
introduce some

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
example of requirements and functions in

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
the

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,840
production ratings profile

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,560
currently upstream the profile only

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
includes

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,400
modules in product home radius

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,479
such as health monitoring life cycle

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,160
management prostate management

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,879
and portion management and so on uh

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,479
however automatic requirements or

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,039
product level use cases

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,000
are important to understand why these

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,000
function modules

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,560
are needed so in this section i'm gonna

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,199
introduce function modules that is

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,919
included in production readiness profile

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,919
and related product requirements for use

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
cases

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,760
first topic is health monitoring

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,800
typical product requirements related to

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,800
this module is when the navigation

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,839
system stops abnormally

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,360
the system shall restore the

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,399
original running statement let's say

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,519
for example think about the situation

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,480
when error occurred while driving and

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,600
using navigation

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,279
the system platform should arise and

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,360
restore it to the normal state during

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,000
this recovery system should display

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,000
a consistent view to the driver and

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,920
should not require a reset operation by

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,959
the driver

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,000
so the system platform should detect

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,360
service abnormality and recover the

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,640
operating state positive intervention

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,040
and also platforms should detect memory

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,000
leak

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,120
and restore to the normal state also

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,040
should

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,440
load in these anomalies

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,399
so here's monitoring is a function

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,760
module

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,760
to meet these requirements

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,120
second topic is lifecycle management

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,720
case related to this module is

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
managing application starting order

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,440
requirements is for example the service

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,720
which was active when system shut down

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,760
charge startup areas and other services

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,760
at the next system start

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,399
for example if the if radio was running

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
when the

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,040
driver get out of the car yesterday

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,480
the driver can start listening to radio

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,560
again quickly

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,600
today when getting in the car

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,600
to meet this requirement platform

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
system platform should uh

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
system start other resident services

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
according to the

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,800
order set in the configuration pipe so

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,120
life cycle management modules control

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,040
the

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,240
disorder of studying

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,839
other services and applications this

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,800
order has to be changeable

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
in the runtime

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,680
another example related to

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,800
life cycle management is loading

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,279
every shutdown logs and error logs shall

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,079
be saved properly

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,519
so for example when multiple services

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,720
service abc

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,519
are running and shutting down every

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,720
shutdown logs must be saved properly

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,720
to meet this requirement longer service

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,480
should be the last service to shut

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,680
down so from platform

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
system proton point of view lifecycle

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
management

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,160
module has to control the shutdown or

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:11,839
the

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,839
shutter and roger service

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:26,000
another topic is power management module

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,079
one typical use case is quick startup

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
product requirements usually define

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,959
startup

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,440
startup time target either operation

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,120
can be started within x second for

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,639
example

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,240
so systems shall allow users to operate

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,240
quickly when getting in the car

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,440
without any support from power

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,079
management modules

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,079
the system cannot start the boot process

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,760
before account state

00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,160
it sounds normal but if the target is

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,120
less than 10 seconds for example it's

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,399
difficult to meet

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,480
this requirement in this manner

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
so if the power management supports

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,000
standby state

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,399
and can receive the dual signal

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
the system can start booting process

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,360
before acquiring state

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,839
and the user can start the operation how

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,240
much quickly

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,200
so the power management module should be

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
able to keep

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,639
standby state and should be able to

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,800
start

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:49,210
services on signal that is to our

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:50,480
signal in this example

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,120
[Music]

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,000
another use case related to power

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,120
management

00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,160
is the art thing

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,079
when systems arrived

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,160
around when the sensor detects the

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,560
dangerous situation

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,560
uh even when the driver

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,240
or even when the system is in account

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,560
state

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,880
a routing function should be activated

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,160
from other issues

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:31,839
so power management modules support this

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:31,839
functionality and some implementation

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:39,920
similar to the previous example

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,920
remote parking is also related to use

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,760
case of power management module in

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,800
summer implementation to be

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,120
controllable from outside a car the

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,839
power management module keeps the

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,800
communication services able in our state

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,120
again

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,000
and communicating with enable

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,279
communication

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,279
with other issues

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,040
first topic is rule-based arbitrator

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,360
this part

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,079
will be presented by nicholas from there

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,160
so

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,160
i'd like to hand it over to you

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
okay

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:41,839
so there's a game stop touch

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,279
so can you see my slide

00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,240
okay okay thank you

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,720
so today i'd like to explain about their

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,360
blood based arbitrator and

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
duration

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,199
and the agenda is here so here

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,000
at first i would like to uh explain

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,360
that what did the little bit of duration

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,399
and the next

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,600
uh so

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:28,160
we will explain the background of

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:32,800
the base arbitrator and operation

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:37,440
then that corner and the sat

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,480
so what can be defined as a root

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,480
and the last will explain

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
a little based upon the software

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
okay

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:56,880
okay then first to

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,120
direct uh what can be the uh what is the

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,160
rule-based arbitration

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,919
so when the several information

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,919
for driver i our content

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:13,039
needs to be notified simultaneously

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:17,120
so blue based arbitrator

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:21,360
called rpa decides which content

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:25,280
is prioritized so in case of the

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,799
ibi or cockpit system

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:33,520
such a feature is important to

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:37,840
facilitate the driver

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,840
to detect the important information

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,640
here is uh

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
sorry

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,360
yeah this picture is the example

00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,240
so left side on

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,320
the in the left side the navigation

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,200
guidance and the phone called

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,200
somewhere warning information

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:14,000
event occurred at the same time

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,880
so we need to decide which

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,480
which one should be notified to the uh

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,600
driver

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,760
and therefore the therefore rba

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:30,080
will decide these uh prioritize

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,559
this based on the alert

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,440
i describe that the product

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,440
specification

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,840
and the next is about the background of

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,640
the

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,640
rule-based arbitrator

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:53,520
so in the legacy

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,000
following program but there

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,720
therefore we want to develop or

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,280
establish

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,280
the html manager

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,960
for the these purpose

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:17,679
however so the display arbitration

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:21,679
will be more complex so because of uh

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,320
there are many seen our content

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,400
and such i've seen your contents are

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:31,200
increased

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,200
for example the autonomous driving case

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,320
and also a flexible arbitration logic

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,760
is needed as based they

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,880
are as a base technology for realizing

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,440
consolidation cockpit and hmi manager

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,440
concept

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,880
so it in order to solve the

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,960
uh such these issues

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,799
and to realize uh his human manager

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,080
case so then so developed a database

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,320
arbitrator

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:12,960
called rba and using

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,960
this software in the real product

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,400
so we

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,400
decided to upstream this to hdl

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:34,480
and the next is about a little bit

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,799
database obturation rules

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,799
so

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:48,320
we can specify the basic rules and the

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:52,720
exceptional rules as

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,720
uh database rba rules

00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:02,320
so for example so other basic rules

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:06,559
we can specify the area

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:10,240
or policy based on the priority

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,240
and also some contents

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,200
and uh about uh regarding to the

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:22,080
exceptional rules

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,520
so we uh specify the constraint

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:31,840
formula like and

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,840
or or implication or something like that

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,320
and in the details so we are making

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,320
some document to control for the

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,280
contribution

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,320
and the last is about the rba

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,840
software especially the

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,840
how to integrate the rba into

00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
hdl

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:11,039
so as of currently so agl has

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:14,880
a agile combustor to composite

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,080
graphics and manager to manage the

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,919
surfaces

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:23,039
from the application therefore

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,400
we are considering how to integrate

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,880
or how to combine the rba and the azure

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,240
compositor

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,360
so in order to minimize the

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,840
impact of the application so

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:43,280
we want to adapt this

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,280
approach shown this picture

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:51,840
the surface application will request

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:56,159
something to the azure composite

00:22:51,840 --> 00:23:00,159
then rbf should such a request

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:03,840
and execute the arbitration

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:09,840
based on the rules specified by the

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,840
specification from oem

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:18,000
and uh so such a mechanism or

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:21,039
uh foucault mechanic uh

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,400
both of mechanics mechanism

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:28,400
well we are considering uh

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:32,159
how to uh through how to

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,919
return the result of the arbitration

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,559
so using the policy default in the hdl

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,559
compositor

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,679
and now we are working

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,039
this we are working according to this

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,159
approach and

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:57,760
as a current plan so we

00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,960
will we can start the

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:05,200
code review from the beginning of the

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:09,840
next january

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:14,720
so that's all about the rba from my end

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:19,840
so i i would like to handle

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,840
that song again thank you

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,840
thank you son

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,840
president missionaries

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
so another topic for production

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,960
readiness

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,360
is a quality requirement

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,320
contributed source codes are fully

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,000
tested for

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,360
actual products for example these codes

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,120
achieve 100 percent of caesar c1

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,840
coverage

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,400
and passed integration test and system

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,840
test

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,679
those tests are not usually oss

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:15,200
because each oss project is independent

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,480
and also contributed source codes

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,760
conform to

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,159
industry standard development rules such

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,440
as

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,440
misra and that

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,559
the entrance after the first committee

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,679
is under discussion but

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,640
also we plan to comply with

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,240
asia's test framework called the

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,440
continuous test

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,640
and we also want to

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,760
follow aja's release cycle and

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,880
update source code you could need it

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,840
provide security patch and so on but

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,840
it's under planning

00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,159
also our approach of production

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,880
resonance is called fast

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,080
but it doesn't mean documents are not

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,279
important

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,279
we think specification document is very

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:14,320
very important especially for oems

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:17,520
but the first version of aj requirement

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,880
specification was released in 2015

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,760
and not updated and there are gaps

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,440
between this

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,559
spec and current source code then

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,240
we'd like to keep on contributing the

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:35,279
spec specification document through the

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,320
this production radiance activity

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,320
but in the short term the

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,159
specification for production radiance is

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,760
also

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,799
under development current version is

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,520
one 0.10 drug volume

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,840
and it's maintained in edgier conference

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,840
page

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,520
we'll keep the consistency between the

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:07,840
source code and the specification as far

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,840
as possible

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:16,320
then i'd like to talk about the

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,960
current state and the roadmap of

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,080
production radius profile this block

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
diagram is

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,320
the architecture diagram from agile

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,440
specification

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,200
the function module we have contributed

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:35,120
we have introduced a mapping into

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:38,159
red circled module in this diagram

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,320
as you can see they are mainly in the

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,919
platform services layer

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,960
and rva is categorized as the partial

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,960
hdr application

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,880
they are the current module in

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,880
production readiness to hire now

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,120
and this rise show our current ground

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:06,159
of contribution to production radius

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,520
we are in the trial operation

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,399
phase now and we have disclosed modules

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,880
mainly in the platform layers and our

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,080
behalf

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,159
towards the next year we branded this

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,520
course application manager

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,320
window managers and so on

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,360
after that we also plan to disclose

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,399
other services

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,279
and html framework created module but

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,320
it's not determined yet

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,960
this is our current roadmap but

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,799
if someone could contribute more more

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,679
modules could be available

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:47,679
or implemented earlier

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,720
so as the final topic of this

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,320
presentation

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,120
i'd like to ask you for your

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,120
contribution

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
production readiness is not

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,279
toyota-specific activity

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,279
toyota is just kicking off for now

thank you for joining our presentation

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:09,840
we'd like to answer a question from

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:09,840
you andre ukrainians

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
so

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,840
looks nothing

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
um

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,799
thank you for question about storage

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,799
life management

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,080
uh i think there is no implementation

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,960
specific to

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,320
the storage drive management but some

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,840
related modules

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:48,640
are disclosed in this slide

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,960
uh stories related modular included

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,960
and

00:31:53,039 --> 00:32:01,200
health monitoring modules check

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,880
devices failure

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,240
but the detail will be this growth

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:15,840
in documentary source code so

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,840
for easy example

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,880

so other members might

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:57,840
answer to this question

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:57,840
if i'm wrong

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840

is shown in this slide i think

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,960
plan to commit as you know

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,159
we are disclosing fast commit and

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,159
during trial operation

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,879
we will commit some

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,320
uh health monitoring power management

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,320
rba and

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,440
in the next phase we'll continue to

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,280
contribute more other services

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,079
including application manager window

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,280
manager and so on

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:29,359
this is the timeline

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,359
of our contribution

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:39,760
and demo image as for the demo image

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,800
we have currently we don't have

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,679
not decided yet we don't plan to

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,079
we don't want to focus on some

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,119
demonstration image

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,240
or complete set of

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,920
the system idi

00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,800
but we are trying to

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,800
enable some

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,440
demonstrate i think

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:17,839
that is what in some application on

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,839
this production readiness profile

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,880
but again it the demonstration is just

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:41,440
mainly for mainly for the for

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,440
testing these platform layers module

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,839
for now

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,160
uh thank you for your question as for

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,720
smacking

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,359
i'm not sure i think there's no problem

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,440
about the policy contribution smart

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,400
policy contribution

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,520
and we'd like to discuss what kind of

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,800
security policy

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,160
is the best for ibm i

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:32,079
at the ibi eg

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:37,839
so i think it's a currently

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,839
discussion topic

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:47,839
product is currently using series

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,680
i think it's not is that correct close

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,839
yourself

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,560
i'm pretty wait for some

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,560
transit

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:27,839
we are discussing a limit

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,839
yes it's true thank you

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,200
there are some there are separate

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:55,200
working group for ic

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:58,319
and actually

00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,480
in thought inside data we have we are

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:09,839
idealizing and

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:09,839
i see team is different

00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,839
so

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,839
foreign

00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,839
okay

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,839
i just called decision

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,800
maybe we can stop the broadcast

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,680
yeah okay thank you for joining

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,680
