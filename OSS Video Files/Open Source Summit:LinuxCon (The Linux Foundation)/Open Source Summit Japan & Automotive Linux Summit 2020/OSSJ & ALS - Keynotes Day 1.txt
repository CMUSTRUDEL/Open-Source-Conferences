00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
code of conduct

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,880
though we are virtual everyone will have

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,799
numerous opportunities to collaborate

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,159
and engage with each other and attendees

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
throughout the event

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,400
please ensure that you've read and abide

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,880
by our code of conduct

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
which in short says that all attendees

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
should feel safe

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520

issues or witnesses anything during the

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,600
event that violates our code of conduct

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
please message our event staff right

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,159
away

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,360
we certainly miss seeing all of you in

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
person

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,799
and i thought i would spend some time

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,640
today giving an

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,960
update on the linux foundation 2020

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
has been a tough year for us as it has

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,119
been i'm sure

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,920
for all of you but i'm proud to say

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,479
that our team and our communities have

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,360
worked

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,159
through it all when the pandemic first

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,479
began

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,200
and we started locking down we went

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,959
virtual

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,239
right away hosting hundreds of events

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,840
all over the world like this one we're

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
attending today

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,959
we increased our mentoring programs to

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
help people reskill

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
during this terrible time of economic

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,520
pain

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,720
provided free training we helped in the

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,720
united states

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,920
fix the u.s unemployment systems which

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,160
were written in cobalt

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,400
50 years ago and apparently hadn't been

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,160
updated in a long time

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,280
we stood by all our communities

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,400
to chip in where we could most

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
importantly

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
we directly are helping right now lead

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
open source

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,720
efforts to combat covid19

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,640
through our exposure notification effort

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,239
in the linux foundation public health

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,760
initiative which was

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,519
incubated founded and run by the late

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,560
dan khan we have provided clear

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,120
communication

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,040
throughout this pandemic in the midst of

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,840
an escalating trade conflict

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,040
about the free and open nature of open

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,480
source

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,239
and the fact that it was not subject to

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,360
many of the export administration

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,519
regulations

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,560
we saw emerging during this conflict

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,720
we've started social justice initiatives

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
to remove racially charged language from

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
our source code around

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,319
all of our communities led by priyanka

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,720
sharma the executive director of the

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,480
cloud native computing foundation

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,799
we created the fin-ops foundation to

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,319
help with cloud financial management

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,920
we brought in the fintech open source

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,599
foundation finos and now have a major

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,519
set of initiatives in the financial

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,360
services sector

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,560
we added hundreds of open source

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,799
projects

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,760
hundreds of new members more than one a

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,840
day

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,840
we used open data to fight climate

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
change in the financial markets by

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
helping

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,439
share data in order to estimate the

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,239
impact of global warming on long-term

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,200
financial

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,959
markets and instruments we used open

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,680
source code to create a smarter grid

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
through the lf

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,880
energy initiative we started a new open

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,960
source security initiative

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,800
we addressed natural disasters with

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,440
earthquake early warning systems through

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
our open

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,639
eew project and many many more

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,800
and finally we lost a good friend dan

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,120
khan former executive director of the

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,360
cloud native computing foundation

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,400
gm of our linux foundation public health

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,040
initiative

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,919
sadly passed away in november of cancer

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,120
then we all will miss him dearly in his

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,960
impact that he's had

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,960
on our communities and yours

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,160
this year we're starting with these

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,720
virtual events

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
but as the vaccine becomes globally

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
available

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,919
and it's safe to get back together our

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,520
intrepid event team

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,639
is going to work to create hybrid

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,360
virtual and physical experiences

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,039
taking the best of virtual events which

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,160
has allowed us to reach

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,800
a lot of new people in places where we

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,160
may not have been able to travel

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,639
but has certainly been something that

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
we still have looked at in-person events

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
and missed you all

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,280
we thought why not combine the best of

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,080
both worlds so we can

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,960
meet both in person and extend our event

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,759
experience

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,000
to virtual attendees throughout the

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
world

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,880
our project growth really accelerated in

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,759
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,560
we now host over 450 of the world's most

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
important

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,759
shared software development initiatives

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,120
ranging from

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,720
linux to kubernetes to node.js

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,479
we're the world's largest certificate

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
authority with let's encrypt

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,880
we host open hardware initiatives like

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,880
risc-5 and open power

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,800
we have open data sharing initiatives

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,759
like lf climate

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
we have initiatives in artificial

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,680
intelligence

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:20,479
blockchain and many many more

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,520
our organization continues to engage and

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,840
reach out into

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,720
new wholesale industries who for the

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,319
first time are engaging in open source

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
whether it's telecommunications

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
financial services energy and climate

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,160
sector

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,639
or the film in motion picture industry

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,479
with the academy software foundation

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,680
our organization is to working with

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,800
industries

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,840
to harvest the power of the community

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
and open source

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,319
to give you an example of just how much

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
work goes on

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,599
in linux foundation communities i

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,319
thought i would share with you

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,039
a few statistics that we recently came

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
up with

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,080
by looking across all our projects it is

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,120
amazing to think

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,240
that we see a million poll requests

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,720
annually more than 31 million lines of

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
code

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,479
and 20 million lines of code are both

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
added and removed

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,400
weekly at the linux foundation this is

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,840
the work of over 200

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,039
000 developers from 19 000 companies

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,039
across 12 000 repositories and these

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,360
aren't just any repository

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,080
this is the most important code used to

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
create

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,199
automotive systems cloud computing

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,400
telecommunication that we all depend on

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,919
and much much more we've worked to scan

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
repositories in order to

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,319
un earth vulnerabilities and provide

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,560
recommended fixes

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
we've seen millions of chat messages

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,400
sent across our communities as people

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,840
make decisions about what goes into this

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,639
source code

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,080
our email lists consist of millions of

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,039
participants

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,800
we've processed tens of thousands of

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,479
contribution agreements to make sure

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,560
that the intellectual property in our

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,759
project is properly maintained

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
and much much more the scope and breadth

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,479
of everything we're doing here at the

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,840
foundation

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,039
is unprecedented in the history of

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,840
computing

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,440
i want to highlight a project i

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
mentioned earlier that was started by

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,560
dan

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,280
kahn our linux foundation public health

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
initiative

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,440
is now now has participation from 19

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,400
states in the u.s

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
in over 20 countries worldwide it's

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,680
being deployed

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,560
to allow people to install a simple

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
application

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,360
on their mobile device and to be able to

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,279
get notification if they've been in

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,000
proximity with someone who's tested

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,000
positive

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,040
for covid19 in places like ireland

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,360
canada new york state this has

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,720
significantly reduced the spread of

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,440
covid19

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
albeit we still have a tough effort in

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
front of us

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,760
to continue to be vigilant about the

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,680
covet 19 pandemic

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,000
another project i wanted to highlight

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,399
was our security initiative

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,279
this year the linux foundation brought

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,040
together

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,800
multiple open source security

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,519
initiatives from

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,120
our core infrastructure initiative to

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,320
open source security efforts

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,200
hosted by github microsoft

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,880
google and others the open source

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,880
security foundation

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,160
is looking across the world's most

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,800
important open source

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,480
projects to identify security threats

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
provide secure tooling and best

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
practices

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,240
provide a more efficient way to report

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,440
vulnerability disclosures in these great

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,160
shared open source projects and much

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
much more i really look forward to

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
seeing

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,760
more work out of the open source

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,959
security foundation

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,360
in the days and years to come

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,600
finally the linux foundation has

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,880
invested in a new way to engage

00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,320
with your community this month

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,360
we're releasing what we're calling lfx

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,959
lfx is a set of tools that allows you to

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,720
work within your community

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,800
to create more secure more reliable

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
and better software for downstream

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,839
consumption

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
in other words we seek to use these

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,279
tools to be the best

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,320
upstream for both a commercial and

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,000
non-commercial

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,800
downstream these tools consist of

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,720
insights an advanced analytics tool that

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,200
allows you to understand

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,519
who's participating in your project code

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,680
velocity within that project

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
build velocity within that project and

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,720
more

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
we have a mentorship platform that

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,279
allows communities to pair

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,360
mentors and mentees and even crowdfund

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,160
sponsorships for those mentees so that

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,320
they can

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,519
take advantage of benefits that we offer

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,079
at the linux foundation

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,160
supporting people in particular from

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,200
underrepresented communities

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,800
our easy cla tool integrates easily into

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,040
a developer workflow

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,519
to allow developers to sign license

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,760
green contribution agreements

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,519
and allows companies to track those

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,440
agreements in order to make sure that

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,079
they're sharing the maximum amount they

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,920
can

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,000
and hanging on to the things that they

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,240
want to keep

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,519
our crowd funding tools allows open

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,440
source projects to come

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
in and ask for donations for critical

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,040
projects

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,480
we have a member enrollment process that

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,440
allow a pro

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,880
project that allows our members to get

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,839
time to value quicker

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,959
across the linux foundation we have a

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
training portal

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,920
that allows you to customize training

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,519
for your organization and your project

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,320

sponsors without your

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,199

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,519
so

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,480
thank you very much for making it making

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,480
this event possible

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,639
i'd like to start uh by um

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,720
just giving an update on covet 19 and

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,199
how it relates to agl and how it has

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,760
affected or not affected agl

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,959
um obviously it's been a challenging

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,199
time

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,399
uh for the entire world and the

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,760
automotive industry

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,959
uh in particular uh has been impacted

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,959
especially at the beginning of uh covid

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,720
um several of the automotive

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,680
manufacturing lines were

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,639
closed down uh production uh came to a

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,120
halt

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,560
uh sales were impacted so it's been a

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,079
very challenging time

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,000
uh there's no doubt um but uh despite

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,320
all of these challenges

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,839
i'm really uh you know proud and glad to

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,120
share with you that despite all this agl

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,560
is thriving and doing quite well and i'd

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,720
like to give you a few updates on that

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,320
first of all in terms of the code and

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,839
the community

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,480
um covet 19 really has not

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,480
impacted us uh its business as usual is

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,880
what i would describe

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,279
um the agl unified code base which is

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,040
our

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:48,160
software platform the progress has gone

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,279
on as usual the roadmap has not

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,120
been really affected

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,279
all of the agl and linux foundation

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,399
support staff has always worked

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,600
from home from the very beginning

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,160
we were built to do this project

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,320
and and this development in a remote

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,480
fashion from day one

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,440
so all of our tools our online

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,480
collaboration

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,120
our mailing lists um all of these

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,639
uh really has enabled us to continue

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,839
working on agl

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,160
in a normal fashion uh

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,600
pretty much unaffected by cobit in terms

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
of the code and in terms of the

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,720
community

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,720
so that's a very positive thing

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,759
in terms of membership we did lose

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
five members year to date some of those

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,720
were

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,320
possibly related to kovid for example we

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,079
had one company

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
where their headquarters was actually in

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,720
wuhan uh

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,079
in china and uh they did not renew their

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,000
membership so i

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,440
would assume that that was related in

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,240
terms of business

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,240
um but the good news is we've added uh

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,720
13 new members

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,040
uh since colgate began and so that's

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,199
over uh one member per month

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,880
and we're expecting probably another

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,520
four or five members

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,280
uh before the end of the year uh so i

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,319
would say this given the environment

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,559
that we're in

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,120
um this is quite good um so there is

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,640
that that very positive note

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,240
um we now have over 160 members

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,959
at agl this is uh

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,160
i think approaching starting to approach

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,600
a local peak i would call it where

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
most of the automotive companies that

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,240
are involved

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
in the automotive industry are already

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,799
members of agl what we're starting to

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,280
see now

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,480
is what i would call companies that are

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,320
at the periphery

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,720
so companies that are into software

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,880
services or cloud

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,559
and want to be part of this ecosystem

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,520
these are the types of companies are now

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,880
starting to

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,320
attract but the core agl membership

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,720
uh in terms of the oems and tier ones

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,360
uh you know we we have uh you know i

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
would say

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,880
the vast majority of those companies uh

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,559
already

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,360
uh as members um and i i don't expect

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,480
that to change

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,039
uh so that's also very positive uh so i

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,919
would say

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,760
also uh in terms of membership uh it's

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,600
been uh business as usual

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,440
which uh in this case uh is good news

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,640
um in terms of uh recent milestones so

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,320
we're really really

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:32,799
uh excited to announce uh that uh

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:35,919
agl ucb 10.0 can you believe it 10.0

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,120
jumping jellyfish which is the code name

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,799
was released on september 24th and one

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,520
of the key things about this

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,480
uh release is that for the first time

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,640
ever

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:52,000
uh we're using uh yakuto 3.1 which is

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,880
a long-term supported uh branch of uh

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,880
yakto or release i should say of yakto

00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,559
and the code name is dunfell

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,120
and so we're basing agl on yocto 3.1

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,679
and with yacht 3.1 long-term support

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,640
that means

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,880
we are able now to offer uh long-term

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,760
support in terms of all of the bsp and

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,400
the board

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,880
all the board support package and uh and

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,640
all of the

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,080
the kernel and the fixes that we're

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,200
going to get from yakuto

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,000
uh we're able to transfer that uh entire

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,240
support

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,200
process to uh agl and our releases uh

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,400
as well and so we're really uh really

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,120
happy to see that

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,039
this transition has occurred for

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,160
complete details on jumping jellyfish

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,720
you can find

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,480
the release notes uh rnr wiki which i've

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,840
included here at the bottom of this

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,840
slide

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
wiki.automotivelinux.org

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,919
so with this milestone you know for some

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,720
reason 10.0 is always a big milestone

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,919
the iphone 10 was a big deal uh android

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,880
10 was a big deal

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,360
you know so uh i thought um you know

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,640
what a what a great segue to maybe

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,600
uh review uh the historical timeline of

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,640
agl

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,200
and how we got here um and

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,640
so we started agl started in 2012

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
believe it or not that's been a long

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,880
time it was born as a linux foundation

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,080
work group

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,559
uh mostly focusing on specification and

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,799
not

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,000
really focusing focusing on code in the

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,440
beginning

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,960
um then you know that work went on to be

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,600
honest it was kind it seems like it was

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,039
kind of a

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,559
slow start um and

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,559
there were some companies involved

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,200
obviously uh but it was a bit of a slow

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,320
start

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,280
and then in 2014 um

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,200
i joined linux foundation and we

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,760
rebooted the project what does that mean

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,760
well

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,280
we rebooted the project into a

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,360
full-blown what we call

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,360
linux foundation collaborative project

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,480
so what that means is that collaborative

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,080
projects have a

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,120
very specific structure we created

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,880
a new charter we created an advisory

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,440
board

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,080
and we created this whole new

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,240
membership benefit if you will with all

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,520
member meetings

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,000
and developer meetings and hack fests

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,919
and things like

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
that so we really took it to the next

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,240
level uh

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,280
and uh in the very first uh

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,799
i would say uh six seven months we

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,799
surpassed 50 members

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,000
and four automotive manufacturers so

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,520
that was a really really good

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,440
start by

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:40,159
february 2015 we held our very first

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,559
all-member meeting and i remember fondly

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,320
it was at the toyota facility

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,679
in tokyo and we had just 40 people

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,000
uh 25 companies in attendance uh

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,440
it was our very first uh attempt at this

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
all member meeting and so

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
uh looking back it was quite small but

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,320
quite uh

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,440
quite the milestone um and in may we

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,760
released the agl specification 1.0

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,360
and that was announced at automotive

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,880
linux summit

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,360
um and then in june we announced

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,720
our new strategy and we called it the

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,039
code first strategy

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,960
and what that meant is that we decided

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,840
we're going to build our own software

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,360
platform from the very you know from

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,159
scratch

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,480
and we decided to kick off this work at

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,880
a

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,000
uh meeting in san jose in downtown san

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,640
jose

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,200
and we decided to name this software

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,799
platform

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,520
the ucb unified code base to indicate to

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,480
the world that we were trying to unify

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,440
um code from several different sources

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,960
you know

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,280
at the time there was a lot of efforts

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,720
going on in the industry uh there was

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,280
uh genevieve tizen uh

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,799
there was uh you know general generic

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,200
open source projects with

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,480
code that could be reused and we really

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,320
wanted to indicate that

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,960
ucb is going to unify those things and

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,679
what's really remarkable is that in

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,039
about

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,080
uh just six months uh we were able to

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,440
build and release

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,919
our very first ucb 1.0 so from the time

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,320
we kicked off that meeting in san jose

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,919
and started selecting open source

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,159
software packages

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,520
and putting together this uh new

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,640
distribution and new

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,280
uh you know software stack uh it

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,840
took six months uh that was just amazing

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,559
to me

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,240
and we announced it at ces in las vegas

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,840
in 2016.

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,840
so that was ucb 1.0

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:46,080
fast forward a little bit and um in 2017

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,760
in may we announced uh that the very

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,880
first vehicle to use

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,520
agl in production was being released and

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,080
we

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,840
again announced that at automotive linux

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,080
summit

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:03,600
that summer and uh in december 2017

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,720
uh agl surpassed 100 members and became

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,240
the third largest

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,520
collaborative project at linux

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,799
foundation uh so in three short years

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,159
uh we went from a handful of members to

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,720
a hundred members

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,520
and uh and becoming the third largest

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
project

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,159
at linux foundation um fast forward to

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,640
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,600
uh we started getting a lot of industry

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,840
recognition

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,279
uh agl won the prestigious tech

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,159
accelerate award

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,120
uh in the uk for the connected car

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,760
category

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,559
we were really proud of that and then in

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,960
july

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,720
uh this is key because we announced that

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,440
we were now branching out into

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,440
not just infotainment but also into

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,240
instrument cluster and telematics

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,240
and we created those ucb profiles

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,400
in 2019 in january we

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,400
we had our very first booth at ces

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,919
and we were awarded the frost sullivan

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,960
award for best in show

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,320
um for our category which was

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,240
a remarkable achievement um in april

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,799
that year volkswagen group

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,440
joined agl which uh was a huge milestone

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,960
because

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,840
volkswagen group being one of the

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,760
largest automotive oems in the world

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,279
uh joining the group really added a lot

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,640
of uh you know

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,600
credibility to agl uh and then in july

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,159
we

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,240
for the very first time surpassed a

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,960
thousand attendees at automotive linux

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,039
summit

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,159
and there were 41 countries in

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,200
attendance

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,559
at that meeting and so by 2019 you can

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,039
see the momentum

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,279
agl was really on a roll and we

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:49,679
surpassed over 150 members with

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,679
11 car manufacturers

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,600
then 2020 uh of course

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,360
uh the beginning of the year was great

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,559
uh we announced that uh

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,880
subaru uh was using agl in production so

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,840
we received a lot of uh press

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,200
and a lot of uh media attention uh with

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,799
that announcement

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,320
um and we also announced ucb 9.0

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,960
at ces and then of course in february

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,960
uh kovit hit the world um at least

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,840
that's when it started to uh

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,320
really have an impact um but like i said

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,640
earlier in my presentation

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,520
it really has not affected our software

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,480
our ability to

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,120
to develop software which to be frank is

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,679
a

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,080
uh testament to the open source

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,880
development methodology which is

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,760
uh people can work remotely we use tools

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,840
we use

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,720
uh um capabilities that allow us to

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,440
uh not be not have to be in the same

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,880
room

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,559
and so that's really good and that's

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,440
what resulted in

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,640
ucb 10.0 being released uh pretty much

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,360
on time

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,279
uh as planned and uh so we're

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,240
celebrating ucb 10.

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,480
uh what a great milestone uh and then we

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,640
also introduced uh the product

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,000
readiness profile which i'll talk about

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,880
in coming up

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,880
in a few slides here

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,720
so earlier in the year the steering

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,120
committee had several meetings over the

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,159
course of the first three four months of

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,200
the year

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,720
uh to try to strategize and prioritize

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,840
what we're going to be working on

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,520
for the coming 12 to 18 months and i'd

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,320
like to summarize it in this fashion

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,640
here very simply

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,480
we want to reduce the amount of demo

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,919
code and demo apps

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,320
that we've been producing and what i

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,279
mean by that is um we did have

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,799
for a small period of time a lot of

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,000
focus on those things so that we could

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,399
attend

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,640
conferences like ces and have at least

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,960
some demo applications to show

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,279
um but uh the steering committee the

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,120
advisory board would like us to reduce

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,559
those efforts so that's that's obviously

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,960
what we're doing

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,840
um the strategy also is to continue uh

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,320
meaning uh you know continue full force

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,760
on

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,440
the things that we've already been

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,200
working on which is uh

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,240
the unified code base uh the ivi profile

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,120
and increasingly uh important

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,360
is the instrument cluster because one of

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,080
the big differentiations of agl versus

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,559
other solutions like let's say android

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,880
is that we can support multiple

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,520
applications in the cockpit

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,520
instrument cluster uh heads-up display

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,919
telematics as well as ibi

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,880
and so that's a big differentiation uh

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,279
compared to other

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,279
uh solutions like android uh you can

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,360
consolidate everything on one platform

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,200
and support one software base

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,520
with different profiles and so we think

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,720
that's very advantageous so we're

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,720
continuing on that uh and uh

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,799
and continuing to fund that effort which

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,840
is being led by uh suzuki

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,679
uh is leading that expert group and then

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,720
finally we plan to increase

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,080
our effort investments in

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,840
uh the ucb production readiness uh

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,600
in long-term support which i've talked

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,960
about by us aligning with

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,120
uh yakuto long-term long-term support

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,799
as well as virtualization uh

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,679
specifically vert io

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,159
which is uh the virtualization expert

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,880
group is being led by panasonic

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,600
and uh we think that's a very critical

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,159
part of what agl is working on because

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,559
it enables us again to consolidate

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,919
multiple functions in the cockpit

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,120
potentially running on the same

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,679
processor using a virtualized

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,039
environment this is very forward

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,840
thinking it's very new

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,520
uh way of thinking and uh it is gaining

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,559
a lot of momentum in the automotive

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,600
automotive industry and agl is already

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,440
uh showing support for this and

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,360
we're ready for the you know the next

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,799
wave of evolution of the cockpit

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,960
architecture

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,960
by supporting all of these functions

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,600
so speaking of the agl product ready

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,279
profile so

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:12,320
you're going to see this in a lot of agl

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,919
discussions in the coming year

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,679
basically what it is is that toyota

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,600
contributed a lot of code from their

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,960
production software base

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,960
and um in it was just

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,520
a whole bunch of code that is too much

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,799
to immediately integrate into ucb so

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
what we've done is we've created a

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,679
production ready

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,240
ucb profile and the goal is to integrate

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,520
all of that code that could you know the

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,520
the the bits and the

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,279
and the modules and the packages that we

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,000
want and think that are beneficial to

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,480
agl

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,200
over the next 12 to 18 months with of

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,200
course

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,000
toyota's assistance and the goal is to

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,240
have a single ucb baseline to be

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,679
as close to production ready as possible

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,039
which i'm sure

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,600
is is uh critical for a lot of

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,519
tier ones and oems in the industry to

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,120
have the software base to be as close to

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,200
production ready as possible

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,440
um the current status is that the code

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,320
contribution is underway

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,399
there's been several reviews that have

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,320
already been completed

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,600
and we expect the product ready profile

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,480
to become available

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,760
in the coming weeks and you're going to

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,480
hear a lot more about this

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,600
in our uh weekly conference calls uh

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,440
developer conference

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,679
conference calls that are uh happening

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,720
every week and also in our mailing list

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,320
etc so

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,320
if you do hear this sometimes you'll see

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,960
it abbreviated as pr

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,240
uh it doesn't stand for uh pr in terms

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,440
of marketing it stands for

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,080
uh product ready uh profile um so

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,720
uh please stay tuned for more uh news on

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,760
that

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,279
as the year goes on

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,760
uh ucb 11.0 which is code name kooky

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,679
koi uh the planned release for that is

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,720
february 2021.

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,880
uh you can find uh details on kooky koi

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,120
on our roadmap which is at the

00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,919
wiki.automotivelinux.org

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,480
which is listed here at the bottom so

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,799
please

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,440
visit that page for full details on

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,440
kooky koi

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:16,480
um on in other news um held

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,919
earlier uh this year joined the elisa

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,559
project um and uh

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,080
we're participating um in the new

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,880
automotive work group that has been

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,399
announced

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,000
uh in case you're not familiar with

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,279
elisa elisa

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,279
is working on

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,640
safety critical applications so

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,240
functional safety

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,240
for things like industrial applications

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,279
nuclear power plants train control

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,760
systems

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,200
and of course cars and cars and

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,399
automotive are a big part of that

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,080
and agl is helping in uh

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,240
driving the requirements for the

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,240
automotive portion of those things

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,240
and the goal of the project really the

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,240
concrete goal in terms of agl

00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,840
is we hope to bring our instrument

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,159
cluster solution

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,360
uh eventually to a functional safety

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,640
certification

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,880
and all of the uh artifacts and

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,279
testing and documentation that are going

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,679
to be used to reach that certification

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,399
will be shared with the agl community so

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,399
that other

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,360
automotive manufacturers and their tier

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,640
one partners can go and get certified

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,720
um with the same base code that that um

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
that we're we're building and so the

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,760
instrument cluster

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,440
will be uh the first that we're

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,519
targeting uh for this

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,519
functional safety uh application

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,559
uh also earlier in the year agl joined

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,919
the yakuto project as a gold member

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,279
and we're on the yakuto governance

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:51,840
board given that

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:54,399
agl depends heavily on yakto in terms of

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,919
you know our base hardware board support

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,240
packages

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,640
and the fact that yakto has announced a

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,559
new strategy for long-term support

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,679
we felt it was appropriate for agl to

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,919
join

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,240
as a goal member and to support yakto

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,679
but also to have a voice

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:15,440
in terms of influencing the direction

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:21,359
to benefit agl and all of its members

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:25,760
so we're now part of the yaku project

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:28,079
um in other news uh ces uh 2021

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,200
of course because of covid has gone

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,240
virtual

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,280
uh so agl and the advisor board has

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,399
decided to

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,240
not attend the virtual event

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,040
in in this cycle we had secured a large

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,119
booth

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,480
in the automotive technology section of

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,879
ces

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,560
but the virtual event really doesn't

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,119
meet our needs because

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,919
our booth was intended to show demos

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,000
from

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,079
uh you know 15-ish different companies

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,680
uh in a virtual environment it just

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,400
doesn't work and so

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,960
uh we felt that it wasn't appropriate

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,000
for us to attend but i have great news

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,160
uh i know it's over a year away but uh

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,520
we're already excited about the fact

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,720
that we're going to be attending

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,960
ces 2022 and i thought i would

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,839
announce that here because uh these

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,040
things take

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,920
long-term planning um so we secured a

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,839
booth

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,520
uh just a few weeks ago in fact we've

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,000
secured a booth in the

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,920
automotive technology area and you can

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,200
see here the green

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,640
booth here agl which is not far from

nissan

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,560
um general motors toyota hyundai daimler

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,560
uh you know audi uh who's who of

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,520
automotive is all around us

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,280
and so we're really uh excited about

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,560

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,520
about sixty percent of worldwide annual

one of the exciting news in this year is

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,599
definitely going to be the great

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,240
achievement by supercomputer fugak

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,680
a fugak is jointly developed by li-ken

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,880
and fujitsu

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,720
and the successor k computer k

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,359
computer ranked fast on the top 500 in

00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,440
2011.

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,079
fujak remains world's fastest

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,119
supercomputer in international rankings

00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,880
released twice a year in 2020

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,480
becoming number one in the following

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,960
four categories

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:46,319
top 500 hpcg hpr ai

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,319
and glove 500.

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,720
product is not just the fastest and also

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,000
provides

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,400
high versatility with k computer

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,520
the customized linux was provided based

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,160
on our fujitsu hardware specification

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,359
meanwhile huawei is compliant to arm

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,599
specification

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,480
which has worked together with linux

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,240
community

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,319
and promoted the standardization in

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,960
linux on arm

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,319
doing this will increase the versatility

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,160
of furaku

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,680
such as possibly learning various

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,319
applications

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,160
so we think solving global social

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,839
problems and making innovation

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,839
are expected by using fugac

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,720
in the next i introduce difficulties and

00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,319
good points from

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,319
operating systems point of view

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,880
as a result of great achievement in fuga

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,280
group

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,119
there were lots of difficulties i

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,440
introduced one difficulty as

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,720
always noise reduction to achieve the

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,079
higher computing

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,359
performance always noise the internal

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,560
behavior of os

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,960
causes a delayable application behavior

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,839
os need to be aligned with linux

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,880
standards

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,800
it made us a lot difficult for tuning to

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,839
reduce os noise

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,800
because any code change has to be

00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,240
accepted by

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,599
linux community importance thing for the

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,040
high performance of the parallel

00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,800
computing system

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,480
is to reduce the waiting state of

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,280
computing jobs

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,839
as a live diagram shows without always

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,160
nodes

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,240
you can see computing jobs end at the

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,880
blue vertical line

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,839
but with always noise it causes a

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,240
waiting state

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,160
and computing jobs and at the left

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,960
particle right

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,280
the delay due to always noise or obvious

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,079
and

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,079
it's a huge impact for the performance

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,680
so we have tuned the system

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,680
not computing jobs getting to the

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,680
waiting state by controlling the

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,599
behavior of many processes

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,800
and behavioral memory purge in os

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,800
this case shows how our engineer's skill

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,440
contributed to the highest performance

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,440
achievement

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,800
what about good point in os quality as

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,680
we chose always to be aligned with linux

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,359
standards

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,400
that makes possible to deliver the

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,480
latest security and critical bug fixes

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,720
it contributes to stable quality in

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,960
operating system

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,200
and we encountered hunger back due to

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,400
the lack of huge pages

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,520
the bug was resolved a short time by

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,040
discussing the

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,040
resolution in linux community

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,000
we fujitsu develops services and

00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,480
products

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,480
under fujitsu's vision as driving a

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,319
trusted future

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,240
and the trusted future will be consist

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,040
of goal oriented

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,800
human centric and creation trust through

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,480
innovation

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,200
we think fugaku represents our vision

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,599
and then open source software in able to

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,599
do that

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,079
here's an example that builders fujitsu

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,280
services

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,839
and product utilize open source software

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,800
visual anila it's a new architecture

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,680
inspired by

00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,920
quantum and the quickly identifies

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,359
optimal solutions

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,280
geneline deep line system is a fujitsu

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,680
ai solution

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:22,240
prime hpc fx1000 fx700

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,760
these are super computers using flex

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,440
technology

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,440
and of course there are more

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,280
so i can tell that we fujitsu challenge

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,200
with open source community

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,400
to develop software which makes

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,280
innovation and

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,960
contribute to society's growth and we

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,000
are looking forward to working together

00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,560
with many of you

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,720
in the open source community thank you

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,440
very much for viewing my presentation

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,839
please enjoy open source summit thank

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,520
you

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:55,520
bye bye thank you komi amazon

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:03,040
our next speaker is bill mulligan

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,000
from cloud native computing foundation

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,280
bill murray is a marketing manager for

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,560
cncf

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,359
and his mission is to tell the story

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,920
of the crowd native community to world

00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,119
to wide audience

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,040
today he will share how telco and edge

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,000
infrastructure powered by cloud native

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,880
technology

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,440
is helping the world stay connected

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,839
through

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:33,440
the very difficult time of coffee 19.

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,440
so please welcome bill

00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,989
[Music]

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,079
welcome to open source summit japan an

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,960
automotive linux summit

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,800
i'm bill mulligan and i work at the cncf

00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,319
today i'm talking to you from berlin

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,920
but i'm going to tell you about how

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,040
cloud native is still keeping us

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,599
connected

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,160
however before i do that let me take you

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,640
back

00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,440
about four years ago when the cncf was

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,440
just starting

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,000
and another phenomenon was sweeping the

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,200
globe i'm talking about

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,680
pokemon go remember walking around all

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,920
summer

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,000
and seeing people playing in parks on

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,079
sidewalks and even in stores

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,760
it brought people together in a way few

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,839
technologies have

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,200
however what wasn't talked about as much

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,720
was how cloud native

00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,520
technologies held the game and all of us

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,040
together from the expected traffic to

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,119
the 5x worst case

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,359
the 50x traffic the game actually

00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,280
received was way beyond the engineer's

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,880
wildest imaginations

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,440
so how do they keep the game and all of

00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,480
us connected cloud native technologies

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,000
like kubernetes

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,480
allowed them to scale to meet the

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,680
demands of their users around the world

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,000
and bring us all together for a summer

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,200
since then cloud-native technologies

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,160
have been on a similar trajectory

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,680
around the world there are 6.5 million

00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,160
cloud native developers

00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,440
with 1.8 of those coming in just the

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,559
past year

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,800
cncf has also seen remarkable growth

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,079
we are now backed by over 600 members

00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,280
including leading japanese

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,640
technology companies like nec ntt data

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,240
and fujitsu

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,720
not only that but cnc cncf also has the

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,440
largest

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,040
end user community of any open source

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,280
ecosystem in the world

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,800
these are the companies like toyota that

00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,559
use cloud native technologies in

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,520
production on a daily basis

00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,559
to connect us all they're all members

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,200
because they want to

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,559
keep connected to the most exciting open

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,359
source projects

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,119
cncf hosts over 70 projects including

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,240
some of the fastest moving open source

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,920
projects in the world

00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,400
like kubernetes prometheus and envoy

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,640
its sandbox projects also represent the

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,599
emerging areas of technologies that will

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,839
shape tomorrow

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,079
like open your edge computing and open

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,720
telemetry for observability

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,520
cncf connects people projects and

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,200
production

00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,920
to create healthy open source ecosystems

00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,520
however not everything is connected in

00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,599
the world of cloud computing

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,280
and this year has thrown a number of

00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,480
hurdles in our community

00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,480
and the world at large cobin is the

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,000
reason we can't all be here together at

00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,920
a linux foundation event

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,200
that the events team works to flawlessly

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,800
pull off for us

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,240
it also presented a massive

00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,000
technological challenge

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,319
as many people work from home and need

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,400
to rely upon telecommunications to stay

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,480
connected throughout lockdown

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,160
spotify traffic for instance has

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,839
increased over fourteen hundred percent

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,359
since the beginning of the pandemic and

00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,440
at t network traffic

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:37,280
has seen peaks fifty percent higher than

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,200
previously recorded

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,880
some of the telecommunications companies

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,880
have even had to degrade their service

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,640
to keep up with the network demands

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,200
even though it is the thing that is

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,559
keeping us all connected to each other

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,280
companies using cloud native

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,880
technologies haven't been able to adapt

00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,040
to this digital transaction

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,319
because of the robust automation of

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,440
resilient systems

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:01,440
that cloud-native technologies to create

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,359
to their user however it looks like

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,000
their service works frictionlessly

00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,720
and it can improve quickly these

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
companies

00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,280
will become tomorrow's leaders the black

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,520
lives matter protests

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,200
have also affected communities around

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,520
the world and the cncf

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,720
is no different if our mission is to

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,240
create sustainable

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,079
open source ecosystems that are

00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,839
accessible to everyone we need to

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,400
understand what barriers are stopping

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,760
people

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,000
from contributing today cloud native

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,839
is a community of doers and we are

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,400
already hard at work to overcome these

00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,040
hurdles

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,880
and keep our world connected we recently

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,640
launched the cnf working group to help

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,559
telco companies understand what cloud

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,800
native means for them so they can keep

00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,680
us

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,720
all connected to one another we also

00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,559
recently launched

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,000
the inclusive naming initiative to

00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,319
enable the industry to remove

00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,640
harmful and unclear language and by

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,000
providing tangible solutions and tools

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,839
to them

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,680
these initiatives have been driven by

00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,559
the community of cncf

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,839
which is the foundation of doers we want

00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,359
to keep the world connected

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:05,440
and let everyone have a seat at the

00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,000
table so when the next pokemon go is

00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,079
created

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,440
it can once again bring the whole world

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,359
together for a summer

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,520
we're a diverse community of doers and

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,839
we want you to join us

00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,680
find a project to get involved with or

00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,599
find us at kubecon next year

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,359
let's keep cloud native connected and

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,040
have a great conference

00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,640
please feel free to reach out to me if

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,400
you want to connect with me

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,079
i love connecting with the cloud native

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,640
and open source communities around the

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,040
world

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:36,800
thank you thanks bill

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:40,480

00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:09,839
experience

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,559
in the ide industry servicing

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:15,599
serving in various global engineering

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,400
and product innovation leaders pro

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,000
with expertise in open source platform

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,480
various industries

00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,200
today thomas will discuss how cloud

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,640
native

00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,640
is edu native as well please welcome

00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:41,880
[Applause]

00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,880
[Music]

00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
thomas

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,960
hello everyone and thank you for joining

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,480
this discussion about cloud native is

00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,559
edge native too

00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,640
i'm going to share how we are seeing and

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,720
developing open source solutions

00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,800
that are applicable to the cloud to core

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,640
iit and to the edge

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,640
and i will be taking automotive as a

00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,640
concrete example of that

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,319
i'm thomas the giacomo chief technology

00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,880
officer at souza

00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,920
i should say souza and rancher as just a

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,520
couple of days ago

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,319
we have announced the closing of a

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,160
merger between suser and rancho labs

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:24,160
the leading container and kubernetes

00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,240
management solution

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,079
so today i would like to share how we

00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,200
see linux and open source cloud native

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,280
technologies

00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,440
with many of them being developed or

00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,720
being based on the cncf and linux

00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,839
foundation projects

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,480
and communities how those technologies

00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,400
are applicable to edge use cases and

00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,319
specifically to modern automotive

00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,480
requirements

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,319
edge computing has indeed a lot of

00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,359
applications and across many different

00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:52,480
industries

00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,559
its adoption keeps growing the industry

00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,599
would still benefit even more from

00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,720
further open source innovation and

00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:01,040
interoperability

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,000
similarly to cloud computing edge

00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,720
computing

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,160
requires infrastructure application and

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,040
data management

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,319
benefiting from ai and ml technologies

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,319
and above all

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,400
the smooth and tight integration and

00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:17,920
connection with on-prem

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:20,160
private data centers and public clouds

00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,119
and while the as a service approach of

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,680
clouds

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,920
and the device-based perspective of edge

00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,960
may initially seem very different

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,319
they are absolutely not disconnected to

00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,640
be successful

00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,760
they are entirely co-dependent on one

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,520
another

00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,680
now let's take a concrete example with

00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,599
connected smart cars almost smart enough

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,079
to be fully self-driving

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,720
and please bear with me for a moment the

00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,920
picture

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,400
of the forest shall make sense very soon

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:52,160
as a way to visualize and represent

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:54,240
distributed edge and cloud setups

00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,920
so even though there's a lot of sensors

00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,040
and compute and control units

00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,839
inside a car cars can be seen as the

00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,000
endpoints

00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,079
of a distributed cloud a distributed

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,240
edge architecture

00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,640
in that forest the cars would then be

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,880
the leaves of the trees

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,400
and on the picture the cars happen to be

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,599
green because they are smart

00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,079
they are also clean as leaves

00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,799
smart cars do not only collect sunshine

00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,760
there

00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,720
but they generate a lot of data some of

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,680
it is processed

00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,760
locally close to the compute as for

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,480
instance latency is not a very good

00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,520
friend

00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,240
of driving reaction time while some of

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,240
the energy

00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,760
some of the data is going back to the

00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,000
branches of the trees

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,200
going back to the on-premise private or

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,359
co-located

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,799
data centers of the automotive

00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,839
manufacturers

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:47,040
or their partners the data is then

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:50,079
stored filtered

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,359
processed and analyzed there including

00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,160
for aiml training

00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,119
and predictive analytics this is a

00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,200
two-way street

00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,160
where the leaves receive software and

00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,559
data

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,440
some updates and also get instructions

00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:05,839
from the branches too

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,160
and this dialogue is actually a multiple

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,319
way straight with exchanges coming from

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,440
and going to the trunks of the trees as

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,000
well

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,079
the trunks are public clouds that are

00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,079
hosting centralized data

00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,720
or some of the driver or some of the end

00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,559
user applications for instance

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,119
they are connecting to and with the

00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,520
branches and the data centers

00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,440
as well as to and with the leaves our

00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,359
cars

00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,799
last but not least and i would even

00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,599
argue that this is the most

00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,640
vital and important part of the entire

00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,599
forest

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,200
is the ground itself the underground

00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:44,319
this is where the seeds

00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,880
and the roots of the trees are located

00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:48,720
where they are fertilizing nurturing and

00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,559
supporting the health of that entire

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,119
ecosystem

00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,160
and that's basically you end users and

00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,480
companies

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,440
i.t and developer professionals and

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,000
teams

00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,480
equipped with tools and processes to

00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,839
manage

00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:07,599
applications data infrastructure

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:09,839
security observe observability and so on

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,599
this is the layer that makes the entire

00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:16,079
forest a possible reality

00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,400
now let's dive a little bit deeper into

00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:21,440
the specific automotive example

00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,680
and the software within the car itself

00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,599
starting with what the operating system

00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,760
of cars could be

00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,240
and here i'm going to talk specifically

00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,160
about the os and linux obviously

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,160
in the context of the critical car

00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,440
infrastructure and sensors

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,480
not only for the entertainment system

00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,359
for such a critical and literally vital

00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,599
needs

00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,480
we have to be able to rely on a secure

00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,680
stable

00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,079
real-time and safe linux

00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,599
this is very similar to some of the

00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,520
specific use cases

00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,119
to some of the specific mission-critical

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,400
workloads we do see

00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:59,920
in the traditional iit domain as well

00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,440
whether they are running in private data

00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,240
centers or public clouds

00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,760
industries like healthcare defense

00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,760
financial services

00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,440
or even generally high performance

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,040
computing and academics

00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,520
have very similar core requirements

00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,160
historically though those two worlds

00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,680
traditional or cloud id and cars

00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,599
have been developing pretty much

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,520
independently from each other

00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,119
using different sets of tools and

00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,920
technologies

00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:29,440
and yes a car is neither a data center

00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,839
nor a cloud

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,280
running the usuality applications yet

00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,960
there are many similarities and

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,400
technologies that can actually be

00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,680
leveraged for both autonomous driving

00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,880
specifically means

00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,839
software driven cars and linux can be at

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,400
the heart

00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,280
of ensuring the performance the safety

00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,200
and the security of that software

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,640
and that requires of course a fully

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,040
safety certifiable

00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:58,160
a fully safety certified linux for

00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,720
mission critical automotive systems

00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,200
a few months ago at souza we have

00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,440
partnered with electrobits in that space

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,640
electrobits is a leading global supplier

00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,160
of ambient software

00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,839
solutions for the automotive industry

00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,079
together we are building and bringing

00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,599
the first safety certified linux to the

00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,359
automotive industry

00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,960
and i'm happy to be in a position to

00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:22,160
share that is where

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,480
that is it is available and usable today

00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,839
and actually it's already making its way

00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,000
in real cars for 2021.

00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:32,640
we are also looking at reducing the

00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,599
number of ecu's from hundreds to maybe a

00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,680
dozen

00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,640
by centralizing i.t at the car level

00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,599
itself

00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:41,599
thanks to a zonal architecture it

00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,799
features only a few central compute

00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,920
clusters

00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:47,440
or maybe even just one in the future and

00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,440
zonal ecu's

00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,119
as gateways to the sensors and the

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,000
actuators

00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,520
the logic is centralized sensors and

00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,160
actuators becoming less

00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,720
smart and the wiring is based on

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,280
ethernet ring backbone to also reduce

01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,400
the weight

01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,480
of the overall system

01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,319
now the car is software defined and can

01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,359
be fully updated over the air

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,000
to get new features and yes security

01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,960
patches

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,160
as well let's put our open source

01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,960
enabled smart car

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:21,520
back in its ecosystem and that is on the

01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,359
roads with pedestrians and traffic

01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,760
as well as being interconnected with

01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:29,119
other cars the driver's phone

01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,280
data centers and clouds a very important

01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,920
of this is the overall orchestration of

01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,400
such

01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,160
distributed environments this is

01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,880
required to manage data

01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,319
workloads and applications across the

01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,079
different elements

01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,599
and it should be done by minimizing

01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,559
human intervention

01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,240
automating the creation the delivery and

01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:51,359
the installation of images

01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,960
of containers packages and patches

01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:55,280
because the life cycle of this

01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,160
environment is going to be many many

01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,839
years

01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,400
and because it needs to scale to

01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:02,319
millions of devices as well

01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,160
this should be jointly handled and

01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,920
planned with placing the different

01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,119
compute and data components

01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:11,440
at the edge at the core or in the clouds

01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,799
depending on what they are needed for

01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,200
actually depending on where they are

01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:17,040
needed even more so

01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,680
last but not least the general

01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,440
orchestration and management solution

01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,040
should also be designed to be both

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,359
modular and

01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,680
platform agnostic as the environments

01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:30,880
will definitely change over time

01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:32,720
and not elements will stay the same over

01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,880
time

01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,559
looking at the edge specifically this

01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,359
starts with a reliable

01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,319
secured and compliant os a container

01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,319
management

01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,880
and software infrastructure stack where

01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:45,920
then real-time compute and data-driven

01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,440
decision making

01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:52,720
are processed on the core and cloud

01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,760
sides data mobility as well as workload

01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,839
portability

01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,599
should be ensured across hybrid and

01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:00,240
multi-clouds

01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:02,079
providing aiml and analytics there is

01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,920
also necessary to manage the overall

01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,000
distributed ecosystem

01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,680
together with an application delivery

01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,920
platform to be able

01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,039
to develop and push applications and

01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,920
their updates

01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,480
to where they should be hosted and this

01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,640
as well

01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,640
is going to be dynamic and not set in

01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,359
stone for the next decades

01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,680
so it should be flexible and transparent

01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,160
to the software development teams

01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,319
whether they are in-house or from

01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,039
partners or even end users at some

01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,640
points

01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,760
as i would love to be able to develop

01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:35,760
apps for my future car too

01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,079
i'd like to go back to our forest from

01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,359
there and share how cloud native open

01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,240
source technologies

01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:43,520
are very relevant for edge use cases

01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,880
including automotive

01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:49,119
either directly or with some adaptations

01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,680
and in any case they help connect the

01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,319
dots with compute and application

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,160
as linux containers can virtually run

01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:58,400
anywhere

01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,680
to illustrate that let me share just a

01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,839
few examples

01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,839
of some of those projects and there's

01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:05,760
definitely many more than that

01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,039
and where those projects could sit in

01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,760
the forest

01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,039
because each layer of the forest has a

01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,280
different purpose

01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:15,119
and a different set of requirements you

01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,720
need to look at the right ones for the

01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,839
right spots

01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,039
so our leaves the edges can be anything

01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,760
from a sensor

01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,079
gateway to a small data center and in

01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,359
our example today a car

01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:31,359
usually there are also a lot more leaves

01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,559
than trunks and branches and they are

01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,480
much smaller

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,160
hence the need for lightweight optimized

01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,640
solutions that can be deployed

01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,920
and managed on thousands and millions of

01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,760
leaves

01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,319
the leaves are also specific with

01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,799
industry regulations and requirements

01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:48,160
hence the technologies serving them

01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,480
should be matching or at least

01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,960
accommodating that

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,720
technologies like cube edge or k3s

01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,160
provide edge-friendly kubernetes

01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,599
environments

01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:02,240
k3s for instance which is a cncf project

01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,039
originating from rancho enables you to

01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,440
deploy

01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:08,000
run and manage kubernetes clusters in a

01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,319
very simple and light way

01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,280
other cncf technologies relevant at the

01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,680
edge

01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,200
include longhorn as a very light and

01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,920
kubernetes native

01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,480
integrated block storage backend for the

01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,559
applications running on the leaves

01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,079
the specific needs at the leaves and

01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,319
cars level

01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,680
apply to everything networking and

01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:29,440
connectivity

01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,520
as well as the operating system with

01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,960
special flavors of linux for it as we've

01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,400
seen

01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,799
technologies running on specific

01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,400
hardware and chipsets are also often

01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:41,680
required for the leaves

01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,400
with arm being an example of that

01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:46,960
now going to the branches or on prem

01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,559
private or collocated data centers

01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,319
that's where you have a little more

01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,799
resources more traditional computing

01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,359
setup and infrastructure

01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,119
this is where rook with ceph could be a

01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,280
relevant storage backend

01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,280
and this is where full-fledged linux

01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,359
distributions and kubernetes clusters

01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,599
can sit too

01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:07,119
then at the trunks we have the services

01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:10,640
public clouds offer

01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:13,359
say aks eks gk and others

01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,319
covering as well networking storage and

01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:17,119
computes

01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:19,039
and additional data and ai ml services

01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,760
needed

01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,280
all of that has to come together if

01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,839
anyone becomes unhealthy

01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,280
not implemented well not talking to the

01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:30,400
other layers properly

01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,640
the entire forest is at risk

01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,680
on the ground we need to abstract this

01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,319
whole ecosystem

01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:38,720
as much as possible yet manage all the

01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:40,240
diversity and scale of components within

01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,319
the forest

01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:44,000
and they are living and evolving things

01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:47,200
it cannot only be done once

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,200
and forgotten for ages and of course

01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,400
edge computing networks get very large

01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,520
very fast as well

01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,280
and it includes various types of clouds

01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,839
and devices

01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,760
thankfully there are projects and

01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,400
technologies that give us the means to

01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,200
cope

01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,000
with all the layers via multi-cluster

01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,640
multi-cloud

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,200
and edge management capabilities for

01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,119
instance

01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,039
through the manager and launcher are

01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,160
enabling such kind of management at the

01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,240
application

01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,680
at the container infrastructure and at

01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,839
the os levels

01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,760
across the entire forests and

01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,680
irrespective of the types of trees you

01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,480
might have

01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,520
aiml now is also enabling operations and

01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,480
improvements

01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,839
of such massively distributed systems

01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,559
although it can be handled

01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:34,400
in the clouds or core data centers it's

01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,520
also getting closer and closer to the

01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,520
point of interaction to the edge

01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,680
with an appropriate abstraction to

01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:45,200
simplify the use of such

01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:47,839
machine learning power for end users

01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:49,839
we are working on technologies like aiml

01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:51,920
orchestrators or orders to enable

01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,839
all sorts of new use cases previously

01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,400
too complex to be automated

01:06:53,839 --> 01:07:00,240
and managed by data scientists or the

01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:02,640
systems that they needed to run on

01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,079
in closing i would like to remind you

01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,760
about a few points

01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,839
first across industries and use cases

01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,880
and including automotive to a very

01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:14,079
strong and large

01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,760
extent edge computing requires an

01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,319
integrated infrastructure

01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,880
and an integrated management that span

01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:23,599
from edge to core to cloud

01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,720
second that cloud native and open source

01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,359
solutions

01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,440
are now being adapted and used for edge

01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,319
computing itself

01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,839
and most importantly that these advances

01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:36,079
will enable kubernetes

01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,520
linux and other cloud native and open

01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,920
source technologies

01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,160
to become the unifying platform that

01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,400
makes edge computing accessible to the

01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,559
world

01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,200
even if we are all remote i hope that

01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,680
you can take advantage of your time here

01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,200
at the open source summit japan to learn

01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,880
more about these projects and

01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,640
technologies

01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,120
thank you very much for your time and

01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:05,150
stay safe

01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:05,150

our next speaker is kalista redmond

01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:23,440
ceo of risk 5 international

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,080
prior to joining risk 5 international

01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,520
kalista

01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:30,480
held a variety of roles at ibm

01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,679
including vice president of ibm z

01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,319
ecosystem

01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,880
where she led strategic relationships

01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,920
across

01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,520
software vendors system integrators

01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,400
business partners

01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,040
developer communities and broader

01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,799
engagement

01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,759
across the industry today kalista will

01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,880
talk about

01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:54,319
the unprecedented changes and

01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:58,719
shifts in the semiconductor industries

01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,719
with that please welcome karista

01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,069
[Music]

01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:10,159
hi i'm calista redmond ceo of risk five

01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,440
international i'm here today to talk to

01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:14,400
you a little bit about

01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,839
the unprecedented changes and shifts

01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,880
that we're witnessing today

01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:21,920
in the semiconductor industry

01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,920
our world is shaped by disruption those

01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:28,319
disruptions can be positive

01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:30,960
negatives forecasted come out of nowhere

01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,560
what is very similar amongst all of

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,839
those disruptions or

01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:39,679
challenges that we face is that when the

01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:41,759
interests are represented by only a few

01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,679
it's time for that game to change and

01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,080
that game needs to change whether

01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:49,040
it's a pandemic we're facing or a

01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,319
monopoly in a particular industry

01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:55,280
or other barriers that we put up when

01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:57,360
those challenges become too great it's

01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,520
time for the game to change

01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,800
and throughout history we can point to

01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,520
times where

01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,520
removing barriers and coming together

01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,640
for a united approach

01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,360
is what ushers in the next generation a

01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,760
stronger

01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,800
better generation whether that's in

01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,400
technology

01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,159
or in health or in economic or other

01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,679
challenges that we face including

01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:23,520
natural disasters

01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:25,600
coming together taking a united approach

01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,360
so let's talk about risk five and the

01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,760
technology that's ushering

01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,480
in this unprecedented revolution that

01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,199
we're seeing

01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:36,320
around the world you know if you look at

01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:39,040
legacy isas they're very complex

01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,760
and very uh challenging to deal with

01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,360
it's

01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,960
partially because of how they've been

01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:45,520
built they've been built

01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,600
incrementally adding on to prior

01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,400
extensions and adding on and adding on

01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,040
until you're

01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,520
you know kind of looking at an a base

01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,800
isa or instruction set architecture of

01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,920
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,719
base instructions we're taking a modular

01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,960
approach

01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,400
the technology isn't new risk

01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,520
architectures have been around for

01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,679
decades

01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,159
but what we're doing is saying you know

01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:09,679
your required base is only 47

01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:11,920
instructions

01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,840
upon that you can add extensions that

01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,440
fit for the challenge that you're facing

01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,960
or the implementation that you're

01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:20,800
seeking to build

01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,120
and that makes it modular taking away

01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,080
licensing and royalty fees is something

01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,400
that makes it

01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,320
uh easier to work with from a technical

01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,760
point of view as well as a financial

01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,560
point of view

01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,520
and building and ushering in a design

01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,800
ecosystem

01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,280
around those innovations is where risk

01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,920
five

01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,760
really starts to bring the game forward

01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,719
we're seeing this disruption around the

01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,679
world

01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,880
and you know with technology comes

01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:48,480
opportunity

01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,560
and we are making sure that that

01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:53,280
opportunity is unconstrained

01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,080
by taking down barriers artificial or

01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,440
real

01:11:54,080 --> 01:12:00,719
around the technology around licensing

01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:02,000
around supply chain you have expanded

01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,400
opportunity

01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,239
both for what goes into your product the

01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,640
innovation partners you work with the

01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:11,760
supply chain that you engage

01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,480
the other uh you know places where you

01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,679
can go

01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:19,120
and bring your product together and

01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:20,800
this also expands the opportunity of

01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,560
where you can take your product where

01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,640
you can take your innovation

01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,000
you are have more freedom to explore

01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,520
those adjacent spaces

01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,080
adjacent markets additional geographies

01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,960
and you can take your innovations into a

01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,159
much

01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:39,199
greater market opportunity

01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:42,880
so beyond removing barriers

01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:45,040
there has to be growth opportunity

01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,840
open source is great but if it doesn't

01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:49,840
fuel and foster growth for our members

01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,280
then we're not exactly on the right

01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,120
track and

01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,719
those opportunities are growing

01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,440
exponentially

01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,840
you know just in june gartner started to

01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:02,880
comment on the growing number of custom

01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,760
processors that they're seeing in asics

01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,159
you know up from 30 percent they see a

01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,679
you know

01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:10,960
trajectory clearly to 40 by 2025 of

01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:13,920
custom asics by

01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,960
oems this is nothing new for the very

01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,520
large design shops or large oems

01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,239
but it is new it is a new starting point

01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:25,520
for entrepreneurs and other participants

01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:28,640
in this space so but

01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:31,520
why is this opportunity expanding

01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,000
the opportunity in iot alone is

01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:37,920
forecasted to be 30 billion connected

01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,960
and iot devices so iot connected

01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:44,000
vehicles wearables smart homes smart

01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,360
phones pcs the

01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,159
opportunity is growing exponentially

01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,560
and with that opportunity comes volumes

01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:56,320
comes adjacent markets comes adjacent

01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:59,360
opportunities for risk five

01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:02,320
we're projected to encompass 62.4

01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:04,880
billion cores of that by 2025.

01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,000
and this is an exponential keger of

01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,920
course

01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,679
but this is an important strategic

01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,920
variable to think about

01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,880
is there opportunity to recoup the

01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,560
investment

01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:18,080
of building on risk five absolutely

01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,679
it's not just that there's financial

01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,320
revenue opportunity

01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,600
but we've reduced the risk of investing

01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,760
in something new

01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,679
because you have an entire community

01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,320
investing along with you

01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:31,679
and that community spans many many

01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,320
different industries

01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:36,800
so we see a lot of advancements in cloud

01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:40,080
and data centers from alibaba

01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:42,320
you know unveiling their risk 5

01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,600
in their data centers for ai

01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,960
specifically

01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,640
to other large oems and hyper scales

01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:52,000
that are continuing to develop

01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:55,280
on risk five we see the growth happening

01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,760
in automotive especially around safety

01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:00,000
these sensors and in the number of

01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,040
processors that are going into an

01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,120
automobile is growing each generation

01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,719
industrial iot has been one of the

01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,640
leaders in our area

01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,560
along with mobile and wireless there are

01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,679
dozens of processors and

01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:15,280
any one device and risk 5 has a role to

01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,239
play there

01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,280
as consumer and iot devices become even

01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,159
more connected

01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:24,560
there is growing new opportunity as well

01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:26,239
as for memory and storage

01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,239
now if you think about where is the

01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,719
adoption happening

01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:33,440
with large multinationals we see one toe

01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:36,560
in the water and ready to embark on more

01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,480
starting in replacing microcontrollers

01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:41,280
or things in existing products

01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,280
but a much stronger focus in tackling

01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,080
new workloads around ai

01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,239
and other implementations that are

01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,760
fueling and giving them a competitive

01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:51,360
advantage

01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,120
for the other end of the spectrum for

01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,199
startups and entrepreneurs

01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:57,679
there has never been a better time to

01:15:55,199 --> 01:16:00,000
get into the microprocessor industry

01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:02,560
and we're seeing that tenfold among the

01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,760
number of members who are signing on

01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,000
more than 100 today of companies less

01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,280
than

01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,960
500 people so

01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:13,120
where is this growth going in our

01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,400
community you know this graph is

01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,760
starting to look like all the others

01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,640
we've seen so far

01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,000
straight up and you know we are today

01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,880
more than 750

01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,760
members actually across 50 different

01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,920
countries

01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,440
we see this diversity across various

01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,640
technical interests as well as

01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,640
geographies

01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,320
today we have about a third of our

01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,400
membership in north america

01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,920
about a third in europe and about a

01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:39,520
third in

01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,159
apac and in apac alone we have about a

01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,199
dozen

01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:45,040
or more members in japan we are very

01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:47,120
excited about the progress that's going

01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,000
on in japan with leadership from sony

01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,960
semiconductor

01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,520
hitachi and and others ranging from

01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,360
academia to industry

01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,640
we're very proud of this dedicated

01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,840
community you know

01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,719
at its core building a successful

01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,800
technology

01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,679
requires a community it requires a

01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,640
community of various technical expertise

01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,960
and interests

01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,840
it requires a community of investors of

01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,040
universities

01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,560
research learning around software as

01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,360
well as hardware

01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,600
and we also engage very deeply with the

01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:22,480
press and analyst community

01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:24,719
so japan is really moving quickly with

01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:27,920
us and we're very proud of the results

01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:31,520
as you can see collaboration across

01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,199
interest and global footprint is leading

01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,320
the way for japan

01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:38,480
we've seen great pride progress around

01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:41,920
vector processors

01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,000
with renaissance engaging with andes

01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,400
these are partnerships that are driving

01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,040
the industry adoption forward

01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,679
we see this as well between uh

01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,320
additional companies spanning the globe

01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,360
no company is isolated to their

01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:57,120
geography

01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:00,320
and that's one of the barriers that we

01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:02,480
bring down with risk five

01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,640
universities are deeply engaged as well

01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,320
as you can see several examples here

01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,800
where japan universities are

01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:11,280
collaborating tightly with industry

01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:15,120
and moving forward on important

01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:17,520
technical contributions to the community

01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,560
our organization risk five delivers

01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,239
incredible

01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,880
member support we have these six

01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:24,560
programs that are there to support the

01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,120
success of our members

01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,920
we're not here for our own goodwill

01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,560
we're here

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,560
for our members and our member success

01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,920
is what drives in and compels the

01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,080
industry forward

01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,159
from technical deliverables and ensuring

01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,560
we guard against fragmentation

01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:42,080
to compliance and architectural tests

01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,199
that ensure that your

01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,679
design and innovation meets the criteria

01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:49,280
of

01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:50,560
the base isa to visibility amplifying

01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,800
not only what risk 5

01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,480
international is doing but also the

01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,840
success that each of our members are

01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,239
realizing

01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,800
learning and talent from universities to

01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:03,840
online learning to training partners

01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,400
advocacy meetup groups around the world

01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:10,159
engaging around 3 000 people

01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:12,880
as well as a technical advocacy through

01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:13,360
our ambassador program as well as a

01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,239
dozen

01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,520
or more geographic and industry

01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:20,080
alliances

01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,239
and finally a marketplace exchange this

01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:23,920
is really where we showcase the latest

01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:27,520
innovations on risk 5

01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,840
and direct that traffic completely back

01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:32,000
to the innovator themselves so they can

01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,840
go realize and grow those relationships

01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,080
and opportunities

01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,600
i encourage all of you to consider where

01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,800
risk five fits into

01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:43,199
your strategy think about where it makes

01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,600
sense to have diversity of architectures

01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:48,239
or to start your company in mission

01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,840
on risk five the contributions of our

01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,960
members are what make all of this

01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,360
possible

01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,040
and we in turn support our members in

01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,840
their success

01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,840
