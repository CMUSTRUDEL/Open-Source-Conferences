so my name is julie goodman i'm the

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,519
executive director of lf energy

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,120
and i'm really thrilled to have you all

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,720
be here this is our first elf energy

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,920
mini summit

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,039
so we have a really busy morning um i

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,279
actually am here

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,400
in uh on the west coast of cal in

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,840
california

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:32,000
um so i am on wednesday

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,280
at 5 48. but for you all it's a morning

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,800
and we have a really busy morning

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,040
first i'm going to take some time and

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,760
set some context for the day

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,079
and then we'll have dr catano from sony

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,840
computer science laboratories

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,680
following that we'll have five

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
pre-recorded videos

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,719
uh two from the netherlands uh two from

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
france

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,000
and one from the united states

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
since you heard from me earlier today

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
i'm not going to talk about

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,719
too much about the imperative about why

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,359
we must decarbonize because i'm going to

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,920
actually assume that you understand that

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
uh

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,240
climate change is real and that it is

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
the greatest challenge that faces

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
humanity

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,960
what i want to talk about is the path

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
forward

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,479
i want to make sure that each of you

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,280
understands

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,119
that in the next 10 years the choices

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
you make professionally and personally

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,080
are going to have a really

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
big impact in either being part of the

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,439
solution

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,640
or part of the problem so my goal is to

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,759
enable you to become

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,680
leaders in developing the strategies the

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,040
products and the services

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,640
that will enable the planet to

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,640
decarbonize our economies

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,680
so for me this chart says everything

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,759
since the 1850s first of all it's a

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,240
composite of data that

00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,799
comes from our world in data and

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,280
since the 1850s at the advent of fossil

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,439
fuel

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
and the internal combustion engine the

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,039
growth of fossil fuel

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520
use has driven gdp while at the same

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,720
time

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,480
producing an invisible pollution co2

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,040
emissions

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,959
which are the source of climate change

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,319
in the last five extinctions

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,280
on earth every single one was caused by

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,520
too much carbon so we actually

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
understand what happens to the planet

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
when there's too much carbon in the

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
atmosphere

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,959
this however is the first time that it's

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,080
been caused by humans and

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
by human productivity so what you see

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
here

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,519
is that our wealth has been driven

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,519
by fossil fuel and however we have

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,160
reached a path where the externality

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,160
is actually now causing a kind of

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,599
collapse

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,959
so you know

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,080
the number is 75 percent is

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,000
it's a little fungible meaning

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,239
that sometimes it is 65 percent

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,680
sometimes people say 75

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,319
but it really what it's saying is that

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
if we remove the carbon the fossil fuel

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
from our power

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,560
our energy our electricity our

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
transportation our vehicles our cars our

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,959
buses

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,760
our trains our boats our planes

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,000
that we can provide 75 of the reduction

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,799
in

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,519
co2 emissions that we need in order to

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
stay below one and a half degrees

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,440
i think that you saw in my presentation

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
where i was showing about the fires that

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,599
have surrounded me

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,280
um for the last three months and you

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,920
know what i say to that is

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
is this is what one degree looks like i

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
really don't want to find out what two

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,799
degrees

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,799
look like so these are our marching

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
orders and this is why this conversation

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,439
with you

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,680
is one of the most important

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,000
conversations on the planet and i really

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,400
mean

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,480
that because i really want you to

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,599
understand how you can do your part to

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,720
transform

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,000
the world and leave it a better place

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,560
so our friends in denmark

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,639
are probably quite a bit farther ahead

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,560
than most other places on the planet in

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,600
terms of

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,720
decarbonization they estimate that 50

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
percent of the effort

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,680
of the energy transition is digital

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,800
that's a really um large number

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,360
and um but you know when i think about

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,440
what's happened in telecommunications

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,960
you know when you have

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,080
telecommunications transitioning to

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,120
75 for virtual

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
it kind of makes sense that we are being

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,400
able to build

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,479
software-defined infrastructure and

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,360
we're being able to use software

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,479
to network electrons we can't actually

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,800
physically

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,040
network an electron but we can network

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,960
the metadata about an electron

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,960
to orchestrate energy

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,160
so based on what we've learned at the

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,440
linux foundation that means actually

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,479
that 80 percent

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,000
of that code will be open source

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:20,080
if we kind of go with that 80 20 rule

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,240
so based on that for utilities

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,120
i think it means that we have to learn

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,520
how to move at the speed of technology

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
and part of the value of open source

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,840
really is avoiding vendor lock-in

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,919
being able to accelerate innovation

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,600
and be able to use a leverage

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,600
development model

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,680
for vendors and oems it means building

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
the future with your customers

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,720
and that's a very powerful thing i've

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,400
talked to enough of the oems vendors and

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
suppliers to know

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,720
that for the most part they actually

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,479
don't know what's going to happen

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,639
three years out from now they don't

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,560
really know how the grid is going to be

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,600
transformed particularly

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,639
as automotives as vehicles

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,319
actually really begin moving towards

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,360
electricity and we have to begin

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,360
orchestrating that

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,520
for consumer electronics appliance and

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,080
device manufacturers

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,120
you know those of you who made egg hvacs

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
and heat pumps

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,919
and all kinds of things whether they're

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,520
washing machines or

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,000
water heaters what it really means is

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
that we have to ensure interoperability

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
and the scaling of new products and

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520
services because

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,400
this is how we are going to be able to

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,960
orchestrate demand flexibility

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,720
and for transportation we want to be

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,319
able to ensure that the vehicles that

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,360
you are going to be building

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,160
are grid enabled and able to

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,199
provide both a value in terms of a

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,560
resource and

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,039
also a load to the grid so

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
this is what lf energy is this is what

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,919
we are going to do

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,479
together is we are going to build

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,280
the reference architectures frameworks

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,080
and

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,639
supporting ecosystem of complementary

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,039
projects

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,080
how we conceive of this is that lf

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,720
energy

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,120
the ecosystem itself is one of the

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
ground zeroes for building the energy

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,360
systems the future

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
and so towards that i really invite you

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,880
to come and join us

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:33,680
and you know isolation going it alone

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,560
really are no longer viable and the

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,120
despair

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,360
of making those choices and going you

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,120
know in that kind of go it alone

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,319
sort of way is really not possible

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,960
these are our members um and uh

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,759
we have had quite a lot of growth in our

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,319
members and

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,720
just even the last couple of weeks and

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,840
these are our projects and i'd like to

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,840
say that we've got

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,560
another three that are coming in by the

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,720
end of the month

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,840
one of the things that i wanted to share

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,919
with you all

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
was it's about the direction of

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,360
digitalization and i think that what's

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,240
important about this

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,319
is this actually comes from lf

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,440
networking and from arbit

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,919
and why it is valuable is to understand

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,879
that what happened in telecommunications

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,879
is also happening in energy what you

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,960
have is you know today

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,319
or yesterday's black boxes they're

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,839
proprietary

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,440
the hardware and the software are uh

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,760
you know aggregated and um and it makes

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,039
it

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,519
very difficult to enable

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,200
interoperability

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,320
and to be able to drive innovation

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,560
between vendors so that when you

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,880
are managing a grid like a national grid

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
or a stakeholder

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,560
you want to be able to have as much

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,200
flexibility as possible

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,920
um to inter-operate and to be able to

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
use

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,760
um the products and services from many

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,959
different vendors

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,519
and so where we're moving towards

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,160
you know really the first call to action

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,399
is around disaggregation

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
and the second is around software

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,200
defined

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
and i think that that's where this

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,080
community is really finding itself right

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,000
now

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,279
is really articulating this is what

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,240
software-defined

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,800
infrastructure looks like those two

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,560
things

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,680
enable utilities

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,160
grid operators aggregators to be able to

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,080
begin

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
automating and to be able to begin

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,040
providing virtual functions

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,279
and so that then takes us into this open

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,560
source project based stack

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,720
and and so this is you know

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,959
uh when i showed you and i'm gonna you

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,160
know in a little bit i'm going to

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,959
go back to that picture of

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,680
all of the functions of the grid there's

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,080
no one

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,640
architecture it's not like you can look

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,360
at cloud or you can look at

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,480
telecommunications and you can have a

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,160
very

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,640
clear stack the stack is very different

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,240
and but this gives us kind of a

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,440
directional idea

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,440
this is where we're going

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,040
the second thing that is actually really

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
new about energy

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,880
is that you've got the edge and then

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,440
you've got data centers

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,839
so you have the edge and you have cloud

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,480
and and then you have on-prem

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,320
and um the other thing that's important

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,640
to understand about energy

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:40,000
is that time scales are really critical

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,120
and so that's some of the work that

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
really has to be

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,880
established in the next five years

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,760
both with 5g and with cloud is around

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,360
latency so that we can have

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,880
cloud-enabled

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,920
or microservice

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,839
enabled architectures that are able to

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,680
rely on infrastructure

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,240
for things that are critical and

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,360
you know in the energy world you have

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,880
the substation

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,240
and customer sighted nodes

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,320
that are then going through

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,360
communication infrastructure

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,880
and then they are the the data about

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
them are moved out into

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,160
system management um and customer and

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
markets

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,800
so i um you know what i wanted to share

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,880
with you about this

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,600
is um when we are talking about the grid

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,240
of the future

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,440
there's there's nobody out there in the

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,240
world

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,079
who is actually building the grid of the

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
future and is just going to throw it

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,800
over the wall and we're all going to be

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
saved

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,839
instead in order to be able to

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,480
facilitate and enable electric mobility

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
to be able to transition to electric

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,279
fuel

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,959
we're going to have to build um

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:07,519
the the functionality of

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,959
the grid and that what you're seeing

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,600
here while it's a

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,839
taxonomy really is a microservices view

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
of the grid of the future and when

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,760
you're looking at it you know you

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,120
recognize

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,320
that smart contracts smart ledgers are

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
totally different than protocol

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,160
conversion

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,760
or you know asset monitoring

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,519
or state estimation or cross-border

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,240
capacity calculation

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,399
all of those things are so completely

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
and wildly different

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,040
but you know the other thing that you

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,600
have is that in the grid of the future

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,959
or in the energy systems of the future

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
part of what we're going to be able to

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,800
do is compose

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,560
new um new

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,639
various different solutions and

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,959
architectures so one of the things that

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,920
uh dr catano is going to talk about

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,880
is around the sony microgrid dc

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,800
microgrid

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,800
which is you know has many parts of this

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:16,240
so really building these architectures

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,279
and composing them is going to be

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
so much about what the future is going

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,800
to require

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,519
from us and the projects that you see

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,079
here

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,440
um part of what i did was i mixed it up

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,880
a little bit so that

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,880
you could see the the blue ones are

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,440
the projects that are coming in in

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,160
december and january

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,720
the yellow one has already been accepted

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,839
and we just don't have the logo for it

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,240
and and then you have

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,040
three other projects that folks are

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,680
working on

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,279
around data around cyber security and

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,079
around fault localization

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,040
and we see those in planning and coming

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,560
forward

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,920
so i hope that this is a some context

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,040
for understanding

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,320
uh the projects within lf energy

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,360
um i had the great

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,440
uh distinct pleasure

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,800
of being able to introduce um hiraki

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
katana and he is an executive vice

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,680
president

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
of the sony corporation where he is also

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,600
the officer

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
in charge of ai collaboration

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,480
additionally dr

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
catano is the president and chief

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,360
executive officer

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,160
of sony computer science labs dr

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,760
katana's interests are wide and broad

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,440
he has completed studies in

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,839
computational biology

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,320
artificial intelligence massively

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,560
parallel computers autonomous robots

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
systems biology and for today

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,839
he will share with us about open energy

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,839
systems and the work

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,920
sony computer science labs has been

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,800
doing in microgrids

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,440
to just give you a little bit of sense

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,920
of how

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,880
this is going to work i'm going to pass

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,800
it off to dr

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,440
catano and then he is the only

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,600
live presentation um we can take uh

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,519
questions during this time

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,560
um you can put questions into the q a

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,959
um and we will do our best to answer

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,320
them

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,199
and um and then i will come back on and

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
we can have

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,199
a conversation if they're questions that

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,320
people want to cover

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,240
um and then and then how i would

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,160
and then i will introduce the next one

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,199
which is the grid exchange fabric

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,240
and uh and i can take questions um if

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,720
you have them

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,480
uh and then we will play the next one um

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,199
so we can kind of go back and forth we

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,639
specifically chose uh this format so

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,440
that we could have some

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,440
more connection and that the attendees

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,519
could actually participate more

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
so if you're okay with that i'm going to

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,959
pass it off to dr katano

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,160
and i am going to put myself on mute um

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,360
and stop my video but i am here and

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,839
uh and i will uh hand this over thank

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,079
you very much

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:11,279
yeah thank you siri uh maybe uh let me

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:15,040
share my slide i guess uh

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,040
okay i'm gonna show this

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,639
perfect okay uh good morning for

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,519
people in asia good afternoon other

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,920
place uh

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,920
or a good night another place as well uh

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,600
i would like to share with you today uh

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,839
is our experience in the open energy

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,560
system uh which is a

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,279
decade-long uh project at the same time

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,680
at the end

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,320
i would like to have briefly uh uh you

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
know uh

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,600
you know discuss about like you know one

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
of the potential approaches we are

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,839
currently discussing rf energy okay so

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,560
uh our recognition

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,000
is like we are in the uh transformation

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,079
phase of the civilization

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,279
as ceo mentioned and we are very much

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,680
shocked with the uh

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,199
the reality uh although the lockdown

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,240
global occurrence coverage like

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,720
environmental

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,600
uh you know issue has not been solved i

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,640
mean it just like

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,880
uh reduced the carbon dioxide loading uh

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,000
about like a 10-year uh time frame but i

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
can now it's pretty much

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
go back to the as we have before so we

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,240
need the qualitative change in the

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
energy landscape and also the gas

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,199
structure of the industry

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
and in the sony computer science lab

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,959
we've been working on a broad area of

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
research including grover agenda which

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,400
is some of the climate issues and

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,919
global medical issues in agriculture and

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,199
cybernetic industries which is basically

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
the ai and data science and

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,039
human augmentation like a creativity and

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,000
a physical augmentation

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,880
uh things like that and the focus uh

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,960
predominantly

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,240
activity in sustainability is an area of

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,120
the global agenda

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,720
uh domain and we are running a few

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,200
projects not just like energy projects

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
but one

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
project we're working on very

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
aggressively is they called the cynical

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,679
culture which is a new kind of

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
agriculture promoting biodiversity

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,200
and the stability of the eu's and then

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,320
try to reduce the income gap in the

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,400
people in africa

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,919
and in the power of the asia and also

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
like apply for their uh

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,880
industrial countries for like uh avon

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,640
agriculture or a new form of agriculture

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
and we have over energy system which i'm

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
going to talk about it should be a good

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,039
disagree system

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,960
and they also have like high-performance

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,799
network uh projects in the space which

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,360
is like we use the uh

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,080
laser beam uh laser to actually be able

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,120
to communicate

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,080
broadband in high through uh high uh you

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
know broadband

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,559
network uh in a space for uh for the low

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,640
orbit satellite network

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,799
as well we can combine them together to

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,039
create like a global ecosystem

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,799
for you know helping the uh you know uh

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,160
global climate issues

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,000
okay so uh our project and energy uh

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
goes back to well over 10 years

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,840
initially we had a very

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,880
interesting prototype like in internet

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,120
of the electricity

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
and then we brought the system uh into

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,880
the africa

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,400
uh to show like uh you know to electrify

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,960
the uh part of the africa

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,679
an initial project which you can see is

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,360
actually public

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,200
viewing for the fifa verdict when sony

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,039
was a sponsor there and then now we

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
brought the electricity and worked with

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,240
whoa

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,720
uh to do the vaccination of the people

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,400
uh in a part of the africa as well

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,320
and then we also have electrified

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,919
northern part of ghana as a pretty much

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,200
like a standalone system rather than the

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,360
grid because like uh

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,760
in between the house was so distant and

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,760
then accuracy use was actually relative

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,360
minimum so it was okay to have like a

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
standalone renewable system

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,200
at the same time we used that system to

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,679
deploy into the shelley owner

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,799
after the ever outbreak in west africa a

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,440
few years back

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,360
and uh we helped them to uh all the uh

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,000
medical professionals to able to get

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,679
like a

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,080
uh breast sample from the ebola

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,400
survivors uh for able to for them to be

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,760
able to uh get the fact in development

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,480
which is going very well

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,280
and now if you uh uh you know uh looking

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,600
into the all the coveted car actions in

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,520
japan uh we have uh work with the

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,280
professor kawaga renowned via

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,200
uh you know biologists and also

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,559
professor nishiyura which is very became

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,200
very famous in japan

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,000
or a coveted uh mathematical model and

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,320
then uh

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
after that like uh you know work on uh

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,760
africa

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,720
we decided to bring the system as a grid

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,280
uh in japan

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,320
and then industrial countries and then

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,000
we thought about like

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,919
a theoretical framework i was involved

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
in the uh uh that you know while the

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,760
current forum

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,440
uh future electricity council and an uh

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,039
complex system council

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,960
and then i was actually used to be

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,720
advised with aldstone in france

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
as well so we actually decided that we

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,480
need to have a system

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,600
which is sustainable resilient and uh

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,400
economically

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,120
affordable and foster the growth so the

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
uh

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,360
our first project which is actually the

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,080
flagship project that dc-oes produced in

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,400
the oyster

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,600
as you can see this is like a compass in

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,520
okinawa science

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,440
science and technology in mainland

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,200
okinawa southern ireland in japan

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,120
and we put our dc micro grid system in

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,799
19 faculty houses okay

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,200
those are the houses that the actual

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,400
family living uh it's not experimental

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,120
house okay so we had a

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,919
you know faculty housing cluster and now

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,039
we got the

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,200
uh you know put the oes uh on that okay

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,159
so uh this is actually the other picture

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,320
and how

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,679
uh we wired up we actually write up in a

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,679
three batch line

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,679
and then uh we get all the status

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
monitoring system and all that so been

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,720
operational for last

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,840
five years uh non-stop are very reliable

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,559
and we increase over 10 percent our

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,679
energy

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,440
energy utility ratio and then uh

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,679
this one specifically are configured to

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,840
see how we can switch between the main

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,919
traditional grid line and the renewable

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,320
uh micro grid system so like a

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,600
facility installed in a photo for the

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
baltic party was

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,360
relatively modest was not with this one

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,679
actually intentionally not

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,799
uh try to get the 100 set of sufficiency

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,360
or over 90

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,400
we actually design the system to be 60

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,559
percent self

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,320
renewable and then 40 percent from the

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,480
transition agreed so we can see

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,240
how we can switch back and how we can do

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,799
how we're gonna have like a regulatory

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,559
huddle

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,720
uh to be able to install this kind of

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,720
system okay that that's a design and

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,200
then a purpose okay

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,360
the system is basically an interestingly

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,400
uh a linux based energy system we have

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
like a hazard cast

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
by x and then haruka all the control

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,159
software

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,159
which is basically basically linux based

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,480
and we have an active kind called draw

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,640
this

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,840
is the kind of a trick we have and uh

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,039
with the baseline

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,120
multiple peer to peer electricity

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,400
uh you know redistribution and that

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,559
that's really the key

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,840
and then we have a algorithm to be able

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,440
to do that and that

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,120
uh you know you might have had like a

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,280
sony decide to make it an

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,039
open source and that is exactly the

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,880
component which is a critical

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,280
core part of the grid system basically

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,799
uh you know we our installation uh in

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,760
okinawa which we can have like a

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,679
different installation

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,360
is basically each house had a sort of

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,320
for the baldeck and the lithium-ion

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,799
based battery

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,159
and then our energy router system or the

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,760
battery control system

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,360
and then connected with the multiple bus

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,679
lines where it basically has the three

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,159
bus

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
lines and the a bus two b b bus and c

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,559
bus line

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,080
and then uh they have like a star

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,880
connections okay that that the whole

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,080
configuration

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
in this experiment we can have a

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,640
different concrete congregation but

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,240
basically we actually have like uh we

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,679
can get more technical materials and i

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,320
don't think we're gonna go into detail

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,679
uh basically we got the uh inter house

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,320
uh communication uh

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,720
uh connection and so we set like a 350

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,039
ball

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,240
reason if you go up like a 400 ball we

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,919
have like a very different kind of

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,640
component which is very expensive

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
so we're gonna decide to go for 350 volt

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,559
and if you have like

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,760
uh someone for some household who have

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,159
like access to the

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,760
energy which is about is almost full and

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,440
still uh you know pvu

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,039
is uh generating electricity and there

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,679
are some scarcity out of place

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,679
uh we're gonna have a gradient of uh you

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,120
know uh voltage level and they got the

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,880
current and you know

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,640
current going around and then we have

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,159
like a trick to be able to

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,919
uh you know enable uh virtual pr2pr

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,760
redistributions okay i'm not going to

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,159
detail unless i'll take your documents

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,240
there

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,400
okay now we have like all the software

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,120
stacker and express and a bigger phone

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,559
and uh you know and then all the apis

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,360
which is the autonomous

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,120
uh power deep power interchange uh

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,559
system uh on top of that

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,159
and then now we're gonna have like all

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,000
the hardware to comply with that do we

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,760
have like an audi monitoring system or

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,360
have all the control system

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,120
as well now and in our reality we have

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,120
like in five experiences like

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,320
you know as we all know like you know

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,480
we're wasting a lot of

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,919
solar photovoltaic output as well you

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,799
know by the time like a 10

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,400
a.m usually you know battery get full

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,600
and then we have to waste

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,760
uh you know rest okay and then uh

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,279
in terms of the energy consumption each

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,080
household as you can see in

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,640
our right side has a high variability

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,880
okay

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
so it makes sense to be able to actually

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,320
distribute the energy

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,640
and this is actually uh you know energy

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,960
utility pattern for each household and

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,960
then

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,640
uh you can see the aqueous substantial

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,720
variability on the patterns

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,559
and then uh you know and this is the

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,559
kind of actual data and simulations the

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,919
middle panel and you know

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,360
it is actual uh you know data how the

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,400
things can happen it's the

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,039
middle and then our third uh figure from

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,960
the uh top and the middle row uh is

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,559
actually how much the energy being

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,760
exchanged so we had the extensive energy

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,240
exchange and from like our 10 a.m

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,039
to like uh 3 p.m as well i mean this is

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,039
the time like

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,480
you know a lot of activity going on and

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,960
a maximum soda for the baltic

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,640
generations and we can do the simulation

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,400
and what happened if like there's no

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,159
exchange we can just cut off that

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,159
we can actually convert the energy

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,760
consumptions uh you know how much the

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,679
how fast the battery can drain up

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,559
things like that that doesn't uh lift

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,520
panel and now with that uh uh we can do

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,600
the uh you know

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,919
recalculations know what is the utility

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,919
ratio in this configuration because we

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,039
target for the sixty percent area

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,960
uh year of energy use and uh when our

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,320
consumption is about like a power day

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,880
consumption is about

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,360
less than uh 10 kilowatt hour and then

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,799
uh

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,360
we got the uh uh about like a 40 to uh

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,279
uh you know it's a 80 percent like uh

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,520
energy uh renewable energy

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,840
ratio uh as opposed to the grease like

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,960
greed is about less than about like a 30

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,440
percent reduce

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,799
and then this is a uh you know renewable

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,520
and if you got like a more

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,360
uh i got to uh 20 kilowatt per hour i

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,720
you know you can stabilize into like a

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,440
30 to 40

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,039
uh percent uh renewable energy use and

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,559
this is great because this is like a

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,159
facility design actually

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,679
uh so like i think it's a design you

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,880
know moving as we design

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,600
so and then uh from there we see the uh

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,880
all the data and we can see like uh what

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,279
is the effect of the

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,799
exchange among the you know entire

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,120
consumption of the energy

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,400
what is the actual the ratio that we use

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,640
the uh renewable

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,880
that we found out like you know depends

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,120
40 to 80 percent depends on the uh

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,360
consumption and uh you know months of

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,720
the year uh at the same time we go what

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,120
is the effect of the uh

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,640
energy exchange it's about like a ten

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,400
percent about like a you know high

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,039
single digit due to a little over ten

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,760
percent

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,320
uh among the energy consumptions uh

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,600
energy demands were actually uh uh

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,279
you know uh save sort of uh or like uh

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
you know what was due to the energy

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,960
exchange

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,720
and then i know uh 10 percent it looks

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,799
it doesn't look like a really big but i

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,080
actually if you go to like a high energy

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,200
sufficient self-sufficiency

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,440
rate that's huge actually i mean if this

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,559
is

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,360
actually the number uh uh figure uh

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,919
depends on each self-sufficiency rate

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,279
okay

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,720
and uh horizontal for each panel of the

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,520
solar photobotic

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,919
size and then uh vertical is the battery

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,679
size

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,200
okay if you look at like a

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,399
self-sufficient ratio

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,279
like uh 99 percent so

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,279
uh if you have like a 15 kilowatt

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,360
kilowatt full solar photovoltaic

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,360
if you have to achieve 99 you have to

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,000
have a question of essential value which

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,000
is about like

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,679
you have to get a 120 kilowatt hour

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,480
battery but if you get the energy

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,279
exchange

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,880
you can do achieve like a 25 uh you know

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,440
kilowatt hour but it's like which is

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,440
actually

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,600
substantial reduction and the faster

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,559
decoder this is actually a different way

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,679
of looking at it

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,600
and if you try to get it's 96 percent

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,200
sufficient rate with the solar photobook

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,360
10 kilowatt and in

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,200
uh you know to do that with that energy

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,240
exchange you need to have a 50 kilowatt

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,320
hour balance

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,159
but you can actually achieve that with a

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,799
20 kilowatt hour battery size

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,200
uh with exchange so this is like initial

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,159
quest substantial cost reduction

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,440
right you know and with the three uh i

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,080
know the size of the

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,120
uh family of a three to five uh which is

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,760
an okinawa

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,600
facility and a practical size you can

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,480
put like a soda photobook in a rooftop

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,559
if you confront

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,679
rooftop that's about like a nine seven

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,000
point five to

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,679
nine kilowatt that is actually a

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,720
practical size that you can put

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,520
uh you know photoprotect uh with that if

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,760
you want to achieve

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,640
like over 90 sales efficiency by the

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,120
renewable

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,399
and you i you know you know you know

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,240
assume like i think you are

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,840
and you have to have like a without

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,559
exchange you have to have 50 kilowatt

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,640
hour

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,880
battery size but you can actually reduce

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,880
it 20 kilo which is very practical size

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,320
okay that means that we can recalculate

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,240
the cost reductions okay

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,760
so like we found out this is a very

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,080
significant and then

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,440
uh you know this is actually a diagram

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,679
showing the control panel monitoring

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,679
panel how energy exchange can be done

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,039
and then also like uh this is very

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,760
resilient now

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,679
you see uh the dying let me play back a

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,480
little bit okay this is my normal and

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,279
then you can just

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,039
uh see uh okay so you see like uh you

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,120
know energy exchange going on

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,240
you know and then once you say okay

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,480
things to say what happened

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,279
okay we had a thunderstorm i mean we had

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,600
the lightning

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,720
and then our network disrupted okay so

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,760
we actually

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,919
uh you know communications are gone

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,840
and then those are the nodes which we

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,840
can actually access from the network

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,200
and they are surviving network and they

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,240
are starting energy exchange by

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,480
themselves okay

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,880
what happens in all which disappear they

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,600
actually move into the standalone mode

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,760
so like even in this case no household

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,480
got a blackout okay even blacker like a

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,039
surviving

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,080
node which is a network of connections

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,480
telecommunications

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,320
internet was connected still alive was

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,080
able to keep going for the energy

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,080
exchange and all other go into the

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,480
emergency standard along energy supply

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,520
mode

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,159
so we have like a very resilient system

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,120
going on okay and in our track record

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,760
it's like we got the

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,120
quest substantial sufficiency ratio and

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,480
we verify the sharing

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,559
provide a very effective uh passage

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,480
cost saving as well and in a very robust

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,559
system and then now everyone stands from

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,399
like a five-year continuous support and

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,159
then uh we get a non-stop

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,919
so they go from historically we start

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,399
from the uh standalone system in

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,600
africa and they got to the uh uh

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,039
microgrid system

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,200
operating uh in okinawa so uh we

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,159
consider this is a very practical battle

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,240
proven system

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,240
and we decide to go move into the next

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,360
stage which is the open source

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,399
okay so because of the uh recognitions

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,760
the uh current

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,360
uh state speed of the renewable energy

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,279
deployment is not enough

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,880
we we see that in a covered rook land

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,519
result so we decided

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,120
we have to take a maximum measure to be

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,760
able to speed up

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,399
the penetration of renewable microgrid

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,480
system

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,320
in a large scale so we decide to you

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,320
know open source and we decide to

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,919
have this particularly the phase one

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,720
we're gonna have like a three-phase open

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,200
source uh

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,640
you know uh plan right now uh first

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,279
phase is the core module

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,120
of the able to have like an autonomous

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,159
power redistribution system this has

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,480
been really the core

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,279
of the grid system and therefore we

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,840
decide to

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,600
work with the idf energy and then all

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,519
the discussion going on we can

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,080
benefit like a boss and then we can have

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,919
our technology to be used by the broader

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,960
stakeholders and then have the wider

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,760
penetrations

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,440
and energy energy oh i know our system

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,120
can be one of the core piece

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,880
of the entire portfolio of the

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,240
technology offensive technology they are

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,039
looking into and then

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,799
uh we have been working a dc dc system

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,120
at the same time we may be able to

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,919
expand this the ac grid system as well

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,760
we have internal uh sort of uh

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,080
validation that this can be done but

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,320
we need to work with other stakeholders

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,120
to be able to expand into that dc ac

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,279
grid as well

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,600
so we can either have a choice over dc

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,679
microgrid a dc ac hybrid and

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,200
ac micro grid uh you know based on the

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,799
technology we are providing

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,640
i'm sorry i started a mixture of the

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,480
japanese and the uh you know

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,760
english one but like we're actually

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,240
going to uh

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,120
broaden the horizon uh working with uh

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,360
lf energy

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,399
uh to be able to accommodate a very

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,399
different configuration

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,320
okay so i think it's just under

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,799
discussion nothing fixed yet

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,480
although we are getting uh sort of a

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,200
consensus on where we should be going

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,279
but a potential action plan if we agree

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,320
is that if first we want to have a basic

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,640
hardware platform

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,919
comprise the oes and our apis probably

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,960
name it can be changed there under the

00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,159
new project but like

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,640
uh let's just use this name for for time

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,640
being

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,720
and then i are consistent with the api

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,320
that we provide and we need the hardware

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,000
and we need the more software stack as

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
well particularly in the hardware you

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
know

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,440
the invader is the issue we want to have

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,640
like invader

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,360
uh would you comply with the uh oes apis

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,080
api

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,480
an affordable hundred derivative you

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,880
know

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,640
uh inviter okay and then our

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,159
configuration cases study here we have

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,519
like uh you know okinawa it's one

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,240
configuration that could be different

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,919
configuration

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,600
what would be the best configuration

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,679
world optimization what is it you know

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,440
we need a simulator optimizer for that

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,519
and then we need to uh you know switch

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,919
off our software uh to be able to do

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,760
that

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,080
and then uh from there we can take the

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,960
next generation system development

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,279
as well we might be the uh a normal

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,679
expansion to the uh current version

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,720
as well or we might redesign that we

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,880
don't know but like

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,240
you know for this kind of system to be

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,240
uh you know

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,360
widely penetrating in a bit this because

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,120
of energy system

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,960
software alone is not going to do that

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,240
you know software can be open source

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,559
but we need a basic uh you know common

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,480
stable hardware platform which is very

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,200
important we need help on this i mean

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,119
that we

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,599
can build ourselves but at the same time

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,639
we like to have like a

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
you know hardware vendor uh you know uh

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,079
to be able to

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,440
uh help us uh creating a standard

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,720
hardware set as well

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,919
uh of course like sony has been uh

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,679
you know member of the open source

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,200
community particularly the linux

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,919
foundation for many years and different

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,919
projects

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,159
we can see and this will be uh if you

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,399
agree this can be yet another addition

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,240
a particular energy front and in the

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,760
hope that we can work together

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,159
for the sustainable future thank you

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,320
very much and i would like to

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,560
answer any questions you have you might

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,560
have

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,919
wow that was great that was really

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,119
really great thank you

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,760
so much um i

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,040
i am so excited and thrilled by this

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,160
because i i think that um when i when i

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,160
conceive of microgrids there's not one

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,960
kind of microgrid and i and

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,040
you know because if if you have a campus

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,040
let's say microgrid or you have

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,040
a commercial and industrial microgrid

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,720
when you imagine how things are going to

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
scale and

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,200
change in you know

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
how how do you do you see us taking this

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,280
as being a

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,680
core and then building around it um

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,200
you know is it to kind of i'd be very

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,280
curious what your thoughts are

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,320
about what the best way to do this would

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,400
be

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,000
yeah well i think that's a great point

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,599
actually it's like uh you know i

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,440
experienced the relatively immediate in

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,800
a small number of cases studied

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
obviously we can't really do that all

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,520
kind of thing

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,640
so like you know we understand the

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,280
nature of the

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,000
dc micro good system and in on a

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,400
specific

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,079
configuration but obviously like there's

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,480
a different demands different kind of

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,320
concretion requires like a we had like a

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,160
uh every house to have a rooftop but

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,240
like you know that's not always the case

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,400
like i said people might have like a

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,839
three to four different uh you know

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,000
power generation station

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,359
you know solar photoprotect or biomass

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,200
or you know uh

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,960
other uh system uh in uh off of the vh

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,320
for example off of the residential area

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,839
but still wants to connect

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,359
and still wants to configure as a

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,240
microwave system that's different

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,680
configuration

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,520
where other people might have like a

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,800
hybrid some rooftop

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,079
and uh some uh you know you know of

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,560
uh semi-centralized power generations

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,480
and now we assume our system use the

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,640
erythema ion battery for now

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,480
but of course we can have a fuel cell or

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,960
like a hydrogen based

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,400
uh or other kind of uh energy stage

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,640
which might come in the future

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,440
so i got you know open energy system

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,680
open means

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,359
open to the various renewable energy

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,680
source and the stretch capability

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,960
now we add to the open means open source

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,960
as well which is uh

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,119
very nice actually but it's like i think

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,640
all we need to do is i'll try out the

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,119
different configurations

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,720
and also uh what we have done is about i

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,119
got 20 households like

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,079
we know we can actually get up to 30 40

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,079
but like if you got like

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,000
you know 1000 house wall we might have

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,640
to have like a hierarchy you know design

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,359
we might have like a uh you know a bunch

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,240
of like a

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,640
you know uh micro grid clusters and then

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,119
uh

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,560
in between they're connected with the uh

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,480
uh you know uh

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,400
you know some uh truck you know but

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,000
different kind of grid architecture or

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,000
like a high voltage dc

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,680
as well depends on how you configure so

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,160
we want to maintain the maximum

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,320
flexibility configuration capability

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,839
and i think we our system is capable of

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,920
doing that but we just need the more

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,240
stakeholder getting involved and try out

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,599
different uh i think at the same time uh

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,160
the other thing you're building but

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,240
we would like to have a stable supply

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,560
chain on the basic hardware

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,240
for example like a battery body

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,320
management system hardware

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,520
in batter which is actually much more

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,160
difficult than people think

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,880
it's a much less like a supplier for the

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,599
invader

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,320
and then uh we need reliable uh you know

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,320
ac dc dc ac dc dc in varus

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,920
and that's really the critical which

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,480
kind of standardized that that would be

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,400
great

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,720
and uh we have all the monitoring

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,680
software as well so like that depends on

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,680
the uh

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,359
use case we can probably modify that as

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,440
well so i think we need to

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,359
build the ecosystem around this and we

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,760
have like uh expense doing that but like

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,839
uh

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,599
you know you know this kind of thing we

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,920
can't really do it alone i mean uh you

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,599
know it has a beautiful slide i mean

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,760
going along is not the way and then

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,480
that's why we decide to go open source

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,359
and

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,760
uh wants to uh work with the all the

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,240
other

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,200
stakeholders and people who's interested

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,760
in saving

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,760
this planet

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:51,119
i i love how you think so um

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,680
when peer-to-peer trading

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,680
is

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,960
clearly what you discovered your you

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,000
know your data

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,320
is that having

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,359
more together not just a single

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,720
household but

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,520
more together actually created a more

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,800
efficient

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,320
economic economically speaking and using

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,599
of energy

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,320
it used it much more efficiently so but

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,119
uh you know do you tell me about like

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,400
how you developed your peer-to-peer

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,359
um model because it's very unique

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,000
and uh and and so i'm really interested

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,000
in that

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,359
yeah so we have a relatively simple

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
peer-to-peer like

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,640
uh request and receive electricity

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
currencies

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,280
uh system rather than a very

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,320
sophisticated one because we can

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,079
actually build up like a very

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,960
sophisticated control on top of the

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,800
system but like

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,560
we are currently assumed like if a

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,320
battery level actually go down a certain

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,000
level for example like a 25

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,160
or something then you know uh the

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
household uh system as you guys are i

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,839
need more electricity

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,359
and then you know then uh you know some

00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,280
other system which actually

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,119
likely to be the full charge or like

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,440
likely to be a full or

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,040
even like you know one actually wasting

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,920
because they can't restore any more

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,480
uh will keep uh you know the matchmaking

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,640
and then

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,760
uh you know if i decide to go who gonna

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,599
provide to the foo

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,680
and then actually the real electricity

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,599
was electrons doesn't really feel

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,280
that way i mean now we have like all the

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,440
network-wise aggregations

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,839
and redistributions like actually the

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,000
peer-to-peer

00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,280
negotiation is actually virtual and the

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,200
actual electrons

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,200
does not necessarily actually move that

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,440
way so like i you know we haven't done

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,599
actually do the uh trading mechanisms

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,880
like you know all the cryptocurrency

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,119
whatever people talking about

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,920
but okay we can actually uh put that on

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,839
top of that

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,119
you know at the same time what we found

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,119
out is like uh

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,040
usually this kind of household like a 20

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,560
kilowatt hour is pretty much like an

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,960
average consumption level

00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,000
with high variability okay one with a

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,319
big challenge with

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,400
that eve we haven't done like a too much

00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:01,760
of the ebay we although we have a beta

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,760
it's like uh nissan actually uh

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,720
forget about that

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,680
is about like a 40 to 60

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,680
kilowatt hour uh you know barry okay

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,599
that's actually it's already double the

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,560
size of that you know consumption

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,000
average household per day okay and tesla

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,760
is about 70 kilowatt hour

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,359
right so like a tesla is actually

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,880
consuming uh you know if you charge a

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,000
tesla for full

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,400
uh it requires a three household whole

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,800
day

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,000
energy consumption level so like with

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,200
the penetration or e

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,119
buoy residential area for sure

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,720
will be really stringent by the how

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,760
people charge

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,520
electric vehicle so like i you know for

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,599
like this energy exchange

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,640
will be even more effective because

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,520
we're going to have like a

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,000
much bigger variability depends on the

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,480
traffic patterns all the mobilities now

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,520
when and how people charge electricity

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,160
to the evil

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,079
so like i think like at this oes like

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,720
energy exchange system has a higher

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,560
value

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,520
if you have a bigger penetration than

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,520
evo in the household

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:15,599
so um have you all

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:18,240
talked with your utilities about

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,839
about their plans with electric mobility

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,839
and around charging and

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,359
how you could optimize the system for

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,280
charging

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,400
yeah i mean uh some utilities are very

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,440
interested and

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,040
uh we are also talking with them as well

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,480
although the japanese are actually a

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,400
regional monopoly and

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,560
although they are opening up a little

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,520
bit with like emerging

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,040
utility uh companies as well but they

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,560
actually work as a more or less any

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,319
oceans rather than the power generation

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,560
a real infrastructure holder

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,920
america they are not interesting in and

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,440
then now also like i probably know

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,960
japanese outside of japan

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,280
i think they require substantial

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,839
interest although like we need like a

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,480
partner to be able to penetrate in that

00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,720
uh

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,720
market because like uh this is like you

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,599
know core infrastructure of each country

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,680
so you can't really just

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,640
go on yeah we're gonna build one so like

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,480
you know so

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,480
one reason we're an open source is to

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,240
ensure that yeah you know availability

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,040
of the uh you know technology

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,880
and ensure uh that this is gonna be more

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,240
secured one because like uh you know

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,720
people can actually tap in and people

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,880
can

00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,720
have like a multiple source and then uh

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,800
even if it's only decide not to

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,560
uh able to continue like people can take

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,160
over you know you can carry on

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,920
and of course we're not really planning

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,640
to you know shrink down the activity as

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,079
well but uh

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,079
you know of course like you want to be

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,640
sure that the uh you know this is gonna

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,200
be there

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,079
it's not gonna evaporate you know uh by

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,960
the end yeah

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,400
yeah yeah so i think this is a really uh

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,880
interesting opportunity

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,760
uh you know if people want to go to the

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,480
renewable

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,720
in a big way i think uh you can't really

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,560
do the uh convention agree because of

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,240
the uh you know stability issues

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,480
it's like if they can have like a

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,880
microgrid system around the renewable

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,640
they can absorb the perturbations by

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,599
microgrid and they can keep

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,119
main grid very stable and i think that

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,240
is probably a very practical

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,119
configuration in a big way

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,680
yeah i i agree so i i have one more

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,680
question

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,920
and then i you know i want to really

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,440
open it up to the audience i mean part

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,480
of why we chose this is

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,079
so people could interact with you

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,680
um what what

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,560
is the relationship of uh the assets at

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,200
the edge

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,480
um in other words when people talk about

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,720
the grid of the future

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,599
they often talk about arbitrage out at

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,480
the edge

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,839
kind of you know this industrial iot

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,839
edge

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,079
in which you have devices that are

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,400
either loads or resources

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,599
to the grid or you know to the energy

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,240
power systems

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,880
um communicating with each other how did

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,440
you all

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,000
design that so that they were talking

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,599
and

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,079
um are they talking to a central system

00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,800
or are they actually communicating

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,760
amongst themselves at the edge

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,599
with some sort of prioritization uh in

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,160
terms of how they load

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,720
uh you know leader election stuff like

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,359
that

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,440
oh yes uh uh you know on the basically

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,040
it's a plt pl we can have like a central

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,880
monitor or central county if you want

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,720
but i got basically when they have like

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,119
among the other connected nodes

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,040
you know we actually decide one uh

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,640
leader one control center which should

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,160
be dynamically assigned

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,240
okay when we have like a you know one

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,440
control center they'll take a control of

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,440
that part of the grid

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,040
and if anything happened to the center

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,760
or like we decided to dynamically

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,680
configure

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,200
other node will take the leadership that

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,960
will be the control center

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,400
you know and then every software has you

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,760
know same capabilities so we can

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,079
actually dynamically switch

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,760
and that's reason why the in a start you

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,119
know in lightning case

00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,319
you know network disrupted okay no uh

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:55,359
uh you know uh kind of uh bus line

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,000
b and c was detached okay at that time

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,920
like i

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,240
assumed like a leader was in the

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,800
baseline c note for example one of the

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,359
uh

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,280
household system in the bus 9c and that

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,839
was detached okay a survived

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,400
then a new leader emerged in between the

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,400
eno

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,520
you know a bus like among like a five

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,240
household and then

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,000
on day two this guy took over and then

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,400
you know start controlling locally

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,040
and so if like uh you know at that time

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,200
like a

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
bus line b and c internet was completely

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,960
down so that they can save sufficiency

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,720
but if like you know disintegrate but

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,240
still they are gonna be surviving by

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,599
themselves he's surviving themselves

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,200
they have like at least they can have

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,960
like a leader and they'll control

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,440
locally so this is like a

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,000
fully autonomous system and dynamically

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,880
assigning

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,880
a control center

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:48,800
fantastic i'm i'm i'm really excited

00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,599
uh for us so uh anyone uh in the

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,480
audience

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,680
any questions um would you like to

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,160
unlike do you want to

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,680
i i actually don't know if that's

00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,680
possible but can you

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,240
if you want to raise your hand put a

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,240
question in

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:12,160
okay we have a shy group of people um

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,280
well i i uh

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,400
katana-san i i am just i couldn't be

00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,119
more pleased and

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,599
and more um the only thing that would be

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,880
better

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,079
is to be there with you uh and in person

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,000
and um i pray and hope that

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,680
that we will be able to do that in the

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,280
very near future

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,240
um and i i look forward to working with

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,200
all of you

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,200
um uh janusi-san our

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,040
do you have anything that you want to

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,160
add um as

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,880
the uh as

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:53,839
as the team that is bringing this into

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,839
open source

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,960
can you hear me yes qatar i can hear you

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,280
thank you for your time

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,040
uh for us to you know share what we have

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,680
done and what we are going to do

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,240
and we really as thanos mentioned we uh

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,440
you know

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:16,720
one of the our key point is to work with

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,839
you know the uh many stakeholders are

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,920
cystonic uh

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,839
computer science laboratories and we are

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,920
very excited to working with

00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,280
all of you joining this you know

00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,680
conference and

00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,400
let's uh discuss together how how we

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,520
will you know

00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,400
expand what we have and what you have

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,640
to realize you know the decarbonization

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,240
uh the carbonization network

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,800
and the future of the greek network

00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,800
thank you

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,559
yeah i i'm hearing that very loud and

00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,800
clear

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,359
and i hope that the audience is hearing

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,359
that too

00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:56,000
[Music]

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,680
i you know at the very end i'm i'm going

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,720
to give all my information

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,520
um clearly you can go to the llf energy

00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,040
website

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,839
um very shortly i hope by the end of the

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,280
year

00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:12,240
um that the project will be a part of

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,920
lf energy and that you will be able to

00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,359
if you come to the website

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,720
to join the mailing list get the code

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:24,400
um and participate we

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:27,760
really are um i you know looking for

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,000
the hardware manufacturers um

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,880
you know i one of the conversations that

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,960
we've had

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,680
as a group as as we were bringing the

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,480
software on board and sony was joining

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,400
is um you know really the conversations

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,319
with for instance the world bank

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:47,440
um and the um and others

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:49,119
who have um really you know maybe the

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,440
world has a thousand

00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,640
or fifteen hundred or two thousand

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,800
microgrids a year

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,920
are getting built i mean they're really

00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,319
not a lot

00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,599
of them it's kind of like we're in the

00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:02,559
very early

00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,160
days um but i think that everybody

00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,119
believes that moving forward that

00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,079
they're going to be

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,440
tens of thousands of these and so it's

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,760
absolutely critical

00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,000
that we build a relationship between the

00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,440
software and the hardware

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,040
vendors so that we can begin to have

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,599
a kind of interoperability in terms of

00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,760
scaling

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,960
and plug and play so that you can go

00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,880
into an african

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,880
village or you can go into southeast

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,760
asia or you can go to north america to

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,480
california

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,880
that desperately needs microgrids and

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,079
and

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,359
basically be able to stand it up very

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,319
quickly

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,040
so we need you all to participate and i

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,520
really look

00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:46,319
forward to the next year with you all so

00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,200
thank you very much

00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:51,599
thank you very much thank you thank you

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:55,839
i'm going to

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:59,760
move us along here um

00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:02,640
and uh so the

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,040
the very next um video so what what we

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,319
did

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,520
was we offered to our attack um

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:10,160
to folks to be able to uh produce videos

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,880
because

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,400
i think everyone knows that it's very

00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,760
difficult because the world

00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:21,920
is round uh to get um uh

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,559
north america asia and europe all

00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,119
together

00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,000
so what they did was that they recorded

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,359
videos

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,400
of um their software and the first

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,040
software that

00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,400
we're going to queue up is called the

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,280
grid exchange fabric

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,319
and we brought this software into lf

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,440
energy

00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:45,440
in february of 2020

00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,200
and the the person who's going to talk

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,319
about it is jonas van

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:53,359
den bogard and jonas is

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,240
also a representative to the governing

00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:58,160
board

00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:01,440
um he is the pack chair

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:04,960
he is a wonderful human being

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:07,440
and a really terrific engineer and

00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,760
so he is going to tell the story about

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,760
grid exchange fabric

00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,760
teo you can bring up the video now

00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,839
please

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,720
hi everybody it's really great to be

00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,040
here

00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,520
and be part of the open source segment

00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,520
in japan

00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,440
let's start with a quick introduction

00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,559
i'm jonas bogat a solution architect at

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,559
aleander

00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,200
and one of the key experts on the grid

00:52:50,559 --> 00:53:01,839
exchange fabric platform

00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:01,839
and this talk is all about

00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,319
about the grid exchange fabric platform

00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,240
also called

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:11,040
gxf an open source industrial iot

00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,640
platform

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,160
initiated by aleander the largest

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,760
distribution system operator in the

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,119

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,680
and has over 7000 employees

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:45,359
gxf is a generic industrial iot

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,720
platform built for organizations that

00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:49,760
manage and control

00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,680
large scale infrastructures it helps to

00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,839
create maximum business value

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,880
with the implementation and use of smart

00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,599
devices

00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,760
after this talk you will understand the

00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:05,040
value of the gxf platform

00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,079
its unique open source approach and also

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,599
you will get to know

00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,280
how to get involved in the gxf community

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,440
we will start off with the key

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,160
challenges of a distribution system

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,359
operator

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,599
like aleanda next

00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:22,079
i will introduce the key use cases of

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,079
the gxf platform

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,880
after which we will dive into the

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,920
architecture of the dxf platform

00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:34,880
i will highlight its key features

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:37,359
and talk about you about the roadmap

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,760
and at the end we also share how you can

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:42,880
get involved

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,880
now let's get started

00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,319
due to global developments and

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,280
innovations

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,079
the way we generate distribute and use

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,839
energy

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,760
is changing rapidly fossil fuel power

00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:01,839
stations will close down

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,839
in order to reduce co2 emissions

00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,880
we see a strong increase in the use of

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,920
renewables

00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:14,480
for example the number of solar panels

00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:17,040
and wind energy is growing very rapidly

00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,839
and also the number of electric cars is

00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,280
growing

00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:24,480
exponentially and this has a huge

00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:27,599
impact on the electric

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,200
electric grid

00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,520
and therefore distribution system

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,760
operations like eleanor

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,079
faces major challenges to support this

00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,359
transition

00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:49,839
and projects like gxf can really help

00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:49,839
organizations like aleanda

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,000
before we discuss the architecture as

00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,720
key features

00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,359
let's take a look at the use cases of

00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,359
gxf

00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,839
and i would like to show you a short

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,040
video which introduces

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:17,839
one of the key and first key

00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:17,839
use cases of the platform in more detail

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,000
as far back as the 70s public lighting

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,319
in the netherlands has been switched

00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,400
using the ripple control technique

00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,920
a centralized system that these days has

00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,160
become obsolete

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,880
it results in more disruptions and is

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,799
becoming more expensive in maintenance

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,960
aleanda believes that this present

00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,839
system no longer meets today's needs and

00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,440
requirements

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,680
and neither does it use the technical

00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,079
possibilities available at this moment

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,160
that are also being further developed

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,040
public lighting does not stand alone

00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,200
but as an integral part of public spaces

00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,280
it plays an important role in people's

00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,760
quality of life and security in

00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,920
areas and districts lighting as an

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,079
entity is becoming more sustainable

00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,559
whereby municipalities are becoming more

00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,799
conscientious in deciding at what time

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,559
and what degree of lighting is desired

00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:12,960
or deemed necessary

00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,319
sustainable lighting not only results in

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,599
less energy usage

00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:19,359
but eventually in lower costs this fits

00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,520
in with the current philosophy among

00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,760
municipalities and provinces

00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,680
aiming to increase the sustainability in

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,160
their areas and districts

00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,000
municipalities are not alone in this

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,839
more and more citizens wish to become

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
involved in the development of their own

00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:36,079
environment and public spaces

00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,079
new forms of collaboration between

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,240
citizens and commercial parties

00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,079
will result in new innovative products

00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,160
and services that will improve their

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,559
overall quality of life

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,640
within the public space we all notice

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,319
that energy networks are becoming ever

00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,240
smarter and that objects and

00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,319
applications are making more and more

00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,720
use of internet technology

00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,319
are wirelessly connected and can be

00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,920
remotely controlled with smart

00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,680
applications

00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,599
this results in different types of

00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,760
information on public spaces

00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,480
becoming within reach which increases

00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,440
the interaction with the environment

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,640
in the area of public lighting

00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,359
municipalities and provinces would like

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,680
to control

00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:17,920
switching and dimming by themselves and

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,599
thus not being dependent on one or

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,680
another supplier

00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,920
as well as this the public lighting

00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,880
needs and requirements differ greatly

00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,079
per region

00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,480
district or city this is why aleanda

00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,440
wants to actively support municipalities

00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,599
and provinces

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,520
in the transition to flexible switching

00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,119
systems of public lighting

00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,359
the starting out point is that

00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,000
municipalities have a maximum amount of

00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,160
freedom

00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,160
in choosing which applications they use

00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,880
for controlling which objects

00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,680
municipalities can therefore get more in

00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,760
control

00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,839
through themselves controlling switching

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,400
times and dimming regimens

00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,160
resolve power failures faster through

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,040
up-to-date information

00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,799
and save on costs through energy saving

00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,920
and more efficient maintenance and

00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,720
management

00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,160
aleanda offers as a solution an open

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,319
generic scalable and

00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,559
independent platform that makes flexible

00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,640
switching of public lighting possible

00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:19,839
and will support more public facilities

00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:19,839
in the future

00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:28,640
this i hope

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,319
this video gave you some background on

00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,079
why aleander initiated

00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:34,960
the gxf platform and to give you an idea

00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,799
of the skill

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,440
we use this today alien is successfully

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:42,480
using

00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,200
gxf to operate and control

00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,160
over twenty thousand switch devices they

00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,760
control

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:52,799
over 700 street lights

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,319
and gxf allowed us to use switch devices

00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:57,119
for multiple vendors

00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,839
that use different particles and

00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,440
different

00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:04,160
communication standards however

01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,920
public lighting is not the only use case

01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,280
gxf

01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:12,480
is used for today for example

01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:15,599
gxf is also actively used

01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:18,960
for metering to retrieve

01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:23,200
metering data from hundreds of thousands

01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:26,880
to millions of smart meters

01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,079
also gxf is used for instructure

01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,720
management

01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,599
for remote device configuration device

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,720
management

01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,520
and over-the-air firmware updates and

01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,640
furthermore

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,160
we believe gxf in the future can also

01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,720
play a role in

01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,839
for example load management to

01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,280
dynamically

01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:50,720
adjust and control the electric grid

01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,760
via edge nodes in a network for example

01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,119
to smooth out

01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,880
peaks of solar farms or peaks of in wind

01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:01,359
farms

01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,280
and also gxf can be used

01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,400
in the future for microwave management

01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,680
to monitor

01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,680
and control microwaves

01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,359
and also we believe that gxf can be

01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:18,079
applied for many more use cases

01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:18,079
even not aware of today

01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,799
now let's dive into the architecture

01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:32,319
by using gxf you can monitor and control

01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,839
your smart devices within your

01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,079
infrastructure

01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:37,040
and from more on an abstract level the

01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,880
platform

01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,960
could be seen as an industrial iot

01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,359
platform

01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,079
and one of the main principles of the

01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:47,440
platform

01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,440
is its modular design

01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:57,440
and support of state of the art

01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,160
security standards for example

01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,359
the platform has zero trust principle

01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,680
implemented

01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:06,079
which means all communication to and

01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,839
from devices is corrected

01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,200
all communication to and from

01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:11,200
applications encrypted

01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:21,680
also gxf has a full audit drill to see

01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:25,200
who did what at what time

01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:28,720
in order to support a

01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:31,039
high number of devices gxf allows

01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,480
high scalable implementations both in

01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:37,200
the cloud

01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:40,079
also in an on-premise situation

01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,400
and to give you an idea of the skill dxf

01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,280
is

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,839
already used to monitor and control over

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:48,640
seven hundred thousand street lights

01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,680
and gxf is built in mind to control and

01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:54,559
monitor

01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,559
over 10 million 10 million devices

01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,119
and best for last gxf is also open

01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,920
source

01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:04,160
why open source because we believe that

01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,960
open source and open standards prevent

01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,920
lock-in and provides a tremendous

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:17,520
opportunity

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:20,720
to collaborate

01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:24,000
gxf has a layered architecture and let

01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:27,119
me walk you through these layers

01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,280
ig applications

01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:34,079
are connected the surface domain

01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,000
via an integration layer and this

01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,799
integration layer contains web servers

01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,799
for example

01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,960
to allow easy integration with

01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:43,119
applications

01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,119
the service domains contains business

01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,640
logic of a specific

01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:49,200
domain such as public lighting or smart

01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,559
metering

01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,680
for example the core layer of the

01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,359
platform

01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,799
routes the messages to the correct

01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:59,760
protocol adapters

01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,319
and contains generic functionalities to

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,599
support

01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:07,280
device management time synchronization

01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,280
and firmware management for example

01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,599
next the protocol adapters in the

01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,920
protocol layer convert the messages

01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,200
to a command that is supported by

01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,400
specific

01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,079
smart device and this command could be

01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,359
any command

01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:26,799
that smart device support for example

01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:28,000
retrieving the energy usage stored in a

01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,799
smart meter

01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,599
or switching command which switches on

01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:33,599
the straight lines

01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:43,760
next have a look at the gcf roadmap

01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,000
currently we are working

01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:58,240
on the new gcap website also

01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:02,000
we are working on integrating gxa with

01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:05,280
with capcaf and we started

01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,799
with documentation

01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:11,119
of the platform also

01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,960
we're working hard on improving the mqtt

01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,920
adapter

01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,839
and also we're making general code

01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,000
improvements

01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:23,760
to further improve the quality and

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,280
stability of the platform

01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,000
and also in 21 we as aleanda continue to

01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,200
improve

01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,440
and extend the platform for example

01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,119
we plan to finalize the doctorization of

01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:40,160
the platform

01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:40,160
also improved eca 104 adapter

01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,319
improve the release management process

01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,559
of the platform

01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:48,160
to make it more transparent for the open

01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,319
source community

01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:52,720
and also have planned many more code

01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:56,559
improvements to further improve

01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,240
performance capability and quality

01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,640
of course this roadmap is not set in

01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:03,760
stone and we always welcome

01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,079
contributions and ids from the open

01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,559
source

01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,559
community

01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:13,599
and talking about contributions from the

01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:15,760
open source community

01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:18,240
let's talk about how you can join the

01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:21,119
gxf community

01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,839
the complete code base of gxf is

01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:26,000
available

01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:30,160
on github under the apache 2.0 license

01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,920
and you can find the link on this slide

01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,480
also there's extensive documentation

01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,799
available on how to use the platform

01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,960
how to install it and how to contribute

01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:41,839
to the platform

01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,200
and also check out our new website and

01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:45,280
the gxf webinar

01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,960
from my colleague robert dustfeldt for

01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,119
even more detailed information

01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:55,200
on gxf and i welcome you all

01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,200
to join us in the open source community

01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:03,680
and also don't hesitate if you have any

01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:07,599
questions or feedback

01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:10,400
to contact us you can contact us

01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:12,240
and stay in contact with us via the gxf

01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,760
mailing list

01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,319
and the email address of this mailing

01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,559
list is on the slide

01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:22,000
and also we have an issue tracker in

01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,000
case you run into an issue

01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,200
thank you very much for your time and

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,039
interest

01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,039
and hope to hear from you soon

01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:43,839
thank you very much

01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,079
that that was really great um

01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,000
before we move on or you know i see that

01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,400
baskar has some

01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,440
questions um i i think

01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,400
questioning about whether there's enough

01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,920
distributed energy resources to produce

01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,599
the energy that we need

01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:15,039
and i i think that um

01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:17,000
there are many indications that in fact

01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,600
we are able to do that um

01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:24,000
[Music]

01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:28,480
whether you're using the wind and uh

01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:31,679
europe or hydro in many countries run

01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:35,759
renewable and hydro

01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:37,120
and solar panels or industrial solar

01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,960
but i think that we're going to have to

01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,000
get creative so

01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,719
it's not that that distributed

01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,799
and renewable energy can't produce

01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:49,120
enough electrons

01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:51,040
they're becoming increasingly efficient

01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,839
and we also need to become

01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:55,199
more efficient with how we use energy

01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:57,679
and

01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:59,359
so we're going to talk a little bit more

01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,400
down the road about open e

01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:04,719
meter but we need to consider that it's

01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,480
not just that we have a proliferation of

01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,920
renewable energy devices

01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:12,560
but that we also have radical energy

01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,560
efficiency

01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,000
ann taloy and john harper are running a

01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,040
project called

01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,279
possible and um poustables stands for

01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,799
power system blocks and power system

01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:30,239
blocks are

01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:33,359
six different um blocks

01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:36,400
that rte developed um to

01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:39,600
be able to uh model and show

01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:41,679
uh the french grid both for regulators

01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,400
and also for planning purposes

01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,520
so i'll be really interested to see um

01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,560
how

01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:51,600
possible has evolved over the last year

01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,400
and tail please queue up

01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,400
the next video

01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,320
hi everybody i'm going to present you

01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:07,199
possible library

01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:09,360
i'm ann i'm community manager and a

01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:13,199
developer of that project

01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:18,080
i'm working for rt the french tso

01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:21,280
we use possible to model our power grid

01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,719
possible is an open source set of core

01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:26,159
system blocks

01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:29,440
written mainly in java dedicated to grid

01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:31,600
analysis and simulation

01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,360
possible is a project of the linux

01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,719
foundation energy

01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:39,679
since two years it is licensed

01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:42,640
under mozilla public licensed version

01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,640
2.0

01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,080
we are hosted on github at

01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:53,040
www.github.com

01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:59,840
possible the community involves

01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:59,840
77 people

01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:16,480
is projection ready

01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:18,560
it offers a set

01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,320
of features for grid modeling and

01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,360
simulation

01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:26,960
for example you can use possible

01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:30,800
to create a state-of-art application

01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:36,480
able to handle a variety of formats

01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:39,760
such as cgms for european data exchanges

01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:42,960
to perform powerful simulations

01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:46,560
and security analysis on the network

01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:49,199
or to displacing a line diagram

01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,760
of the substation you can have in your

01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,760
network

01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,199
all the features for grid modeling and

01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:02,800
simulations

01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:06,239
are fully described in our websites

01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:10,719
here here you have

01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:13,840
a full description of the green modeling

01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:17,840
and a full exp

01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:20,840
a full description of how you can extend

01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,679
the grid modeling for your specific

01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:27,199
needs

01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:29,840
you can find here all the grid exchange

01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:33,280
formats that we support

01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:35,679
so for example we support also pssc

01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:40,000
formats

01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,000
high treble e matte power

01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,719
you can perform a lot of simulations

01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:48,400
with possible

01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:52,320
like power flow security analysis

01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:55,520
or time domain simulation for that part

01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:58,560
we rely on an open source project called

01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,560
called dinaro

01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:07,760
possible offers some advanced features

01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:11,120
like high performance computing

01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:13,440
or data management as

01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:16,080
time series management or database

01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:20,560
management

01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:24,000
we also provide a set of micro services

01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:27,040
around the blocks

01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,080
you can have also responsible a

01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:33,760
python binding

01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:38,000
to make some

01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,000
proof of concept around possible

01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:43,760
a key feature of possible is

01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,600
its modular design at the core of the

01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,480
open source approach

01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,159
it enables developers to extend or

01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:55,120
customize its feature

01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:55,120
by providing their own plugins

01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:05,040
you can see here our roadmap

01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:05,040
it is what we expect to do next year

01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:14,480
and here you have the community

01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:18,080
the community exchange on spectrum

01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:22,159
for questions and issues

01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:26,000
and you can you have here our slack for

01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:29,840
more daily conversation

01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,400
if you want to participate to our public

01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:35,840
technical steering committee

01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:39,040
please have a look at

01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:43,840

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,840
to join

01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,920
possible is already used in a number of

01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,640
projects

01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,840
you have pharaoh parao is an open source

01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:22,239
to you hello everyone i'm john a

01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,320
developer from the greet suite project

01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,400
grid suite is an open source project

01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,320
developed at

01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,840
github.com greetsweet please come and

01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,000
check it out

01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,600
the goal of the project is to build upon

01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,920
the pausable project

01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,600
and offer easy-to-use tools used to

01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,520
perform many different tasks

01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,040
that are needed to run coordinated

01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,960
electricity grids

01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,239
such as the european electricity grid

01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,600
that we're seeing right now on the

01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,840
screen

01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,360
today i'll be giving you a brief tour of

01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,199
our first tools

01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,560
and we'll talk a bit about how we make

01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:55,600
them

01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:58,000
let's start with the grid study tool

01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,880
currently on screen which is displaying

01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,640
a beautiful map

01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,320
of the european grid it's got colors

01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,760
to differentiate between the different

01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:08,800
voltages

01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:13,120
and you can zoom and pan

01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,120
and even get this stunning european view

01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:19,360
okay let's switch to the french network

01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,000
now we see here a list of available

01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:24,080
networks

01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,760
in different formats for example cgmas

01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,760
cgmes or uct

01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,080
right now we're displaying the map with

01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,000
a dark theme

01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,000
and straight lines between the

01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,640
substation

01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,800
substations let's switch it over to a

01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,159
lighter theme

01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:47,280
and to lines

01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:51,360
drawn by the gps positions of

01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,360
all pylons in the line

01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,040
and now we have the whole view of the

01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,920
french network with accurate gps

01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,320
positions for

01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,080
all the lines we can even get a feeling

01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,040
of how the power is flowing through the

01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,800
network

01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,400
when zooming in and seeing the little

01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,199
arrows that are animated

01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,199
along the lines

01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:21,280
to get this smooth map with 60 fps

01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:22,320
animated arrows we use the awesome

01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:25,360
library called

01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:30,080
deck gl which uses webgl

01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:32,880
under the hood to get the performance

01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:35,040
on this map we can simplify things to

01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,719
get a better overview by

01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,880
displaying only the higher voltage

01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:42,080
levels and by

01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,719
hence showing the french backbone

01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:46,880
electricity backbone

01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,960
on the left side we get a list of the

01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,960
substations in the network

01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,600
which in which we can search for one

01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,719
substation using this filter

01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,719
which is really fast

01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:01,760
and we can ask for substation single

01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,199
line diagrams

01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,560
where you see the different voltage

01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:11,199
levels of the substation or for only one

01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:14,400
voltage level grid study is a tool

01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:16,239
to explore networks so we allow

01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,880
interacting with these single line

01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:21,120
diagrams for example by clicking on

01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,920
these breakers which will toggle them

01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:26,480
it will open closed breakers and close

01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:29,520
open breakers

01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:33,679
the greet suite is also a

01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:36,960
collaborative tool so we allow sharing

01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,480
links to our work to work with

01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,199
colleagues

01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,320
let me open this link in another browser

01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:44,000
to simulate

01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,480
another colleague working with me on

01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,480
this case

01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:55,840
the link brings him directly to the same

01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,840
substation as the one i was looking at

01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,679
notice two things about this single line

01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,000
diagram

01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,679
it's got only one voltage inside this

01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,840
whole voltage level which has a computed

01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:09,760
value of 243

01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:13,360
kilovolts and it's got

01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:17,040
on this line 77 megawatts of power

01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:19,520
going out as a first demo

01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:21,120
i'm going to click on this breaker i

01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,960
will open this breaker

01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,239
and disconnect the two bars from one

01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,520
another

01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:31,040
this should trigger the topology

01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:32,960
recomputation on the fly

01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:35,600
and it should be visible immediately

01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,000
live in my window in my browser window

01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,960
where i

01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,600
click on the breaker as well as in the

01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,920
other

01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,400
browser where my colleague bob is just

01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,400
watching

01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,360
here we go the app now shows us that we

01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,199
have two voltages

01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,480
one with the light green and one with

01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:57,120
the dark green

01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,920
but their values are unknown yet this is

01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,280
because

01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:04,480
the app has already has only recomputed

01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:06,159
the topology but not all the electrical

01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,639
values

01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,760
to recompute all the electrical values

01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,880
we need to run

01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,760
an electrical simulation the simplest

01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,159
kind of

01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,000
electrical simulation is called a load

01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:21,040
flow simulation

01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,679
and it computes the steady state of the

01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,800
voltage

01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,920
and power throughout the grid based on

01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:29,360
the constraint

01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,440
of the power plant's

01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,360
production targets and the consumer's

01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:36,639
demand

01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,520
let me also open this breaker here which

01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:40,080
should

01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,560
after we recomputed the values show that

01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,080
the power is no longer 77 megawatts

01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,920
flowing through this line

01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:49,440
but instead it should be zero because

01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:53,120
the line has become disconnected

01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:54,560
let's run the low flow the load flow is

01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:58,840
of course delegated to

01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:01,840
possible and here we see the logs of the

01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,840
computation

01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:12,400
and now we see the updated value of zero

01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,400
to run this load flow we use the

01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,199
possible framework

01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,880
and we ship the code from possible in

01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:23,520
docker containers

01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,480
that we deploy either in a kubernetes

01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,400
cluster

01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,080
which is what we use to run our public

01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,800
demo at

01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,360
demo.possible.org

01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,320
or for simpler deployments like the one

01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,280
i have now

01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:40,159
using docker compose this is what we're

01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,159
seeing with these

01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:47,360
logs

01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:50,560
to get live feedbacks on all operations

01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:53,280
we use an asynchronous architecture

01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,320
and send messages through through

01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,600
brokers

01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:00,800
like rabbitmq and through websockets

01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:04,480
back to the browser

01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:07,840
for the servers we chose a stateless

01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:09,120
approach because it gives us a lot of

01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,560
power to

01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,880
easily develop new features

01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,639
it is such a powerful model because any

01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,120
computation can fail

01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:21,760
and be picked out big picked off by

01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:24,880
another process where it left off

01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:28,800
all computations are stored in a

01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:31,760
database as soon as they're done

01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,520
we're using a scalable database as well

01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,520
we use cassandra

01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,040
so we're confident that our platform can

01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,000
be used by many users

01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,280
at the same time deploying a new version

01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,440
is easy as well

01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,280
because there's no state in our code so

01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,560
we can just replace the previous version

01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:49,840
with the new one

01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,120
everything is persisted in the database

01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,440
and that's how our continuous

01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,800
integration and employment works

01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:57,600
by taking merges to the master branch on

01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,080
github

01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,679
and triggering github actions that end

01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,960
up recreating pods

01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:09,040
in the kubernetes cluster

01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:12,159
okay back to the app in addition to the

01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:15,280
geographical map we can see a table

01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:17,520
of all the elements in the network

01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,960
and this table can even allow you to

01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,600
interact with

01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,239
the elements for example by setting new

01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,920
targets

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:26,159
for productions and re-running

01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,719
simulations

01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:31,440
we can also see the results from the

01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:31,440
simulations

01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,400
loadflow simulations are not the only

01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:39,120
simulations that you can run

01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:42,320
another type of simulation is is the

01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,320
security analysis

01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:47,520
running a security analysis means

01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,520
checking one by one for a list of

01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,800
predefined contingencies

01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:56,880
whether or not they affect the network

01:23:52,800 --> 01:24:00,880
for example in this case i could

01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,360
ask for the platform to run a simulation

01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,480
for

01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,199
in case each of the lines of the 400

01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,000
kilovolt

01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:09,520
lines in the networks had a problem so

01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,400
this would mean running

01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:18,239
for this network 867 contingencies

01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:20,960
and getting results on which lines

01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:23,679
when they have a problem cause

01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,840
disruptions in the network

01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:27,520
i'm not going to do it because for this

01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,440
you need more than the simple

01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,560
docker compose deployments or else it

01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,560
will take a very long time

01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:39,040
speaking of predefined contingency lists

01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,520
we made a very simple app that allows

01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:44,159
you to create them

01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,800
it's very simple because it's based on

01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:48,239
the

01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,320
possible contingency domain specific

01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:54,800
language

01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:56,320
we use react the front-end javascript

01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,600
framework to make these apps and it's

01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:02,239
really fast to build

01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,760
here we see the contingency that i used

01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:07,440
earlier

01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:09,520
it's only a few lines of code because

01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:12,320
pausable makes it very easy to write

01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,800
those contingencies the

01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,480
a real groovy script that uses the

01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:21,440
possible

01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:23,440
contingency dsl domain specific language

01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:25,040
one last task that is useful in

01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:28,400
coordinating networks

01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,400
is to get network data

01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,760
is to get network data from the

01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,360
different grid operators that are

01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,440
connected together

01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:37,120
and verify that their individual

01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:39,760
individual grid models

01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:42,080
are coherent and can be merged together

01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,480
in a merged grid model

01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,120
and that's in that this model is also

01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,320
stable

01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:49,120
using a low flow stimulation so we have

01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,159
this tool

01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:54,960
called grid merge which will run

01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:55,920
this kind of workflows as soon as grid

01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,800
operators

01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,960
publish their data let's simulate the

01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:04,560
publishing of the data by grid operators

01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,560
and see what happens in the app

01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,760
here this script will simulate the

01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,760
publishing of the data

01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,760
so we see here that the app received the

01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,239
network

01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,960
and is running a load flow on it so it's

01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:23,040
light blue

01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,080
until the load flow determined that it's

01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,320
correct

01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,840
now it's gotten dark blue because the

01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,639
load flow on this network said it was

01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,560
okay

01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,560
the same happened for the next network

01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,520
and now the next ones have been merged

01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,159
together

01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,639
and the load flow has been run and green

01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:39,760
means

01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,120
okay we see the process uh being

01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,560
repeated

01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:51,840
every hour as our script is simulating

01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:51,840
the data sent by grid operators

01:26:54,320 --> 01:27:02,000
receiving computing receiving the second

01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,000
one in an instant

01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:05,679
receiving the second one computing the

01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,520
load flow on the second one

01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,920
and then computing a load on the merged

01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,920
network

01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,199
okay that's it for the demo today in the

01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,280
future

01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:18,320
we plan to make more tools that are cut

01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,880
that cover more

01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,760
of the tasks needed to run an electrical

01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,080
grid

01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,760
and uh and improve the current tool

01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,360
tools as well

01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:30,320
for example we want to be able to

01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:33,679
quickly describe variants of networks

01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:35,600
that would be the same as swit opening a

01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,040
switch or closing uh opening a breaker

01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,719
or crossing a breaker

01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,960
but instead express the fact that we

01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:45,280
want to maybe add a substation

01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:48,880
or add a line between two substations

01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:52,639
or maybe change the demand

01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,639
for power

01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,800
we also want to add simpler ways to

01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:59,760
describe

01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:01,440
simple contingency lists where you don't

01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:05,040
have to resort to writing

01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:09,040
even a short and easy script

01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:10,880
we would like to get a good eye

01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:12,719
that will show you that will help you

01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:16,159
sort of a wizard that will help you

01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:19,280
creating contingency lists

01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:20,400
for the grid merge tool maybe getting

01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:24,400
more alerting

01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:27,679
and more results would be a nice feature

01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:30,400
so maybe sending emails as soon as one

01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:33,120
individual grid models fails the checks

01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:36,159
or something like that

01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:37,760
these are just a few of the improvements

01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:41,520
that we're going to make

01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,920
please check out github.com grit suite

01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:46,639
regularly to see what we're up to thank

01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,639
you for watching

01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:01,760
bye

01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:01,760
wow that's pretty cool um

01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,040
i i'm not sure if you um how many of you

01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,400
out there are actually

01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:13,840
doing grid modeling but to recognize

01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,840
uh the amount of

01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,760
you know assets that they're actually

01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,000
tracking that are

01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,120
being composed and you know one of the

01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,520
core values

01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,719
the core paradigm of the grid is called

01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,560
inertia

01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:28,880
which is the ability to manage supply

01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:31,120
and demand so

01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,920
you know this demonstration and this

01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,920
software

01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,159
came out of rte which is a french

01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:39,840
transmission system operator

01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:42,080
and and that's the high voltage and

01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,360
we're going to go to the completely

01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:46,320
opposite end

01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:47,520
with open ee meter which is really

01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:50,159
looking at

01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,280
behind the meter and how do you actually

01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:54,480
value

01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:57,040
energy efficiency now

01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,960
when you move to renewable energy one of

01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:01,360
the things that we have to be able to

01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,239
do is manage flexibility and demand

01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:05,120
response

01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:07,120
so the next two ones open e meter and

01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,280
then open leader that come after it

01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:10,560
are really about how we manage

01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,360
flexibility

01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,800
um so that we can continue to match

01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:18,800
supply and demand

01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:21,040
um by making uh choices uh with regards

01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:25,120
to

01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:27,600
perhaps decreasing demand when

01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:30,239
when there are constraints on the system

01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,480
or increasing demand

01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:34,480
for instance when you have an enormous

01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:37,760
amount of sun and

01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:40,480
and so those are issues which

01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,800
are often referred to as the duct curve

01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,320
and

01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,000
and what you want to be able to do is

01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:47,120
flatten the duct curve by

01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,679
increasing demand during times when you

01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:51,280
have high solar and high penetration or

01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:54,639
high wind

01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:57,760
so open e meter is the the next one

01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,000
are there any questions about what you

01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,400
all

01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,239
saw when possible i'm not sure i can

01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:06,239
answer it but

01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:07,760
i think it's a great project um

01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:10,159
okay so i'm going to keep going go to

01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:14,080
open e meter and

01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:14,800
this is phil no and this is a great

01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,719
story

01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,719
so take it away theo

01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,560
hi everyone uh welcome to impacts at the

01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,480
meter

01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,360
i'm really excited to be here at the

01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:33,920
open source summit

01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:35,520
remotely and uh to tell you a little bit

01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,199
about the opening meter which is a

01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,040
project that is near and dear to my

01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:43,920
heart

01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:47,280
i've been building this uh with um uh

01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:50,560
my uh with the team at uh elf energy and

01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:52,080
recurve where i work um and

01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,320
uh excited to show you a little bit

01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,280
about how it works um the kind of

01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:58,960
problems that

01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,760
it solves and you know why we're open

01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,440
source

01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:06,560
and what it might mean for you

01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:07,679
um so i'm going to jump right in um this

01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,880
is going to be a fairly quick

01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:10,840
presentation

01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,400
um just to kind of give you the overview

01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:14,639
of

01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,679
where this fits in there is a there are

01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:19,199
a lot of

01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,920
uh very cool uh uh elf energy projects

01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,639
out there

01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,320
uh many of which are presenting um at

01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:26,400
the summit and uh i'd recur

01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:29,040
i'd encourage you to to go see as many

01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:32,800
of those presentations as you can

01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:34,639
um so let me go ahead and

01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,280
and sort of open this with the

01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:40,320
discussion which is

01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:43,280
um at the center of any

01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:44,480
problem that uh right at the center of

01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:48,320
any solution that

01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:51,679
that uh is kind of being proposed here

01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:55,199
is uh discussion of climate change uh

01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:59,199
this is why we're here there

01:32:55,199 --> 01:33:02,960
are a lot of potential avenues into

01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:06,159
solutions for climate change and um

01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:08,320
and each one of them is as important as

01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:11,840
the next um

01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:15,040
and um and these problems are

01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:17,440
are wide reaching um there are

01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:19,520
a lot of energy users and there are a

01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:22,640
lot of things that affect our climate

01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,760
um and um

01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:27,440
[Music]

01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,000
every um we'll get into this a little

01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,560
bit more

01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,320
but um the opening meter helps tackle

01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:35,679
only a small part of this

01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:38,880
um and um and

01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:40,400
naturally in with such a which with such

01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,830
a big

01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:44,719
kind of um

01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:48,080
[Music]

01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:51,760
problem no one no one solution is

01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:54,000
is ever really going to be um

01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,000
uh

01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,360
so we're going to need lots of things

01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:04,400
helping us to achieve

01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:08,000
our our climate goals and that starts um

01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:11,199
at the nation state level um and

01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,440
it goes um

01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:14,719
uh it is going to have to reach into

01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:17,920
every part of our

01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:19,679
of our lives probably um and it's going

01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,440
to require a lot of innovation

01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,800
and there are a lot of technologies

01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:25,199
being developed

01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,880
to change the way that we generate

01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:31,440
energy and the way that we consume

01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:32,880
energy um and um

01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,520
and uh the thing that we're going to be

01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:40,080
talking a little bit more about today

01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:43,600
are buildings buildings cover the earth

01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:46,639
and buildings are used for

01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:50,560
so many different um

01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:54,080
things uh ranging from industrial

01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:57,440
uh you know processes to

01:34:54,080 --> 01:35:01,040
uh commercial um

01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:02,400
uh outfits and of of every type

01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,480
imaginable

01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:08,000
as well as residents residences

01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:11,199
single-family multi-family buildings

01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,360
each of these are subject to

01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:14,480
the conditions of of the world and try

01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:18,639
to create an environment

01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:21,920
and and give us the tools um

01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:23,199
to uh live our lives and to to get

01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,320
things done and they're extremely

01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:28,960
important

01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:32,480
and they use a lot of energy and um

01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:36,159
the open e meter helps us

01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:40,320
to understand how to

01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:43,840
quantify the impacts of

01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:47,440
um of energy on buildings

01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:49,440
um but again i'm getting ahead of myself

01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,960
uh let me talk a little bit more first

01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:54,400
about kind of

01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:56,159
um uh

01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,840
one other side of this which which i

01:35:56,159 --> 01:36:00,880
think um

01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:03,280
is relevant to um

01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,880
uh an understanding of of why the

01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:07,440
opening meter exists

01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,480
um so grid problems are are

01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:12,320
multi-faceted

01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:16,560
um there are a number

01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:20,800
of factors that you have to consider

01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:23,040
when trying to change the way that the

01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:26,320
grid operates

01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:29,600
and uh that starts um

01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:30,800
from the basic problem of needing to

01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,320
meet

01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:37,280
generation with supply

01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:39,199
or with demand uh meeting supply of

01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,679
these resources with demand

01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,719
and really there are two prongs to any

01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:45,600
approach that may

01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:46,480
affect the grid one is to change the way

01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,440
that

01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:49,440
energy is generated

01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,280
another one and the one that's more

01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,760
relevant to the open e meter

01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:58,159
is to change the the way that energy is

01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:01,679
consumed

01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:05,440
and there are many approaches for that

01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:05,440
um and um

01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,960
but both of both of these come together

01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:12,400
in

01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:15,920
energy grids which are complicated

01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,920
um and

01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:24,880
uh includes things like

01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,880
um

01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:33,600
peak energy usage periods uh

01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:37,360
weather events which are um

01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:40,320
which affect grid usage so um

01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:41,119
there was a day i i live in california

01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,280
the day

01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:44,159
there was a day in california last year

01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:48,000
when

01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:50,880
to buy a uh a megawatt of

01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
power which usually costs around 30 us

01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,199
dollars

01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,800
um costs over a thousand dollars

01:37:55,199 --> 01:38:01,280
on the grid spot market and

01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,040
these times which are most energy

01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:03,840
intensive for the grid are also the

01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:06,080
times which are

01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,880
most energy which are most carbon

01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:10,080
intensive

01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:14,239
uh for our planet and um

01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:17,840
and furthermore um uh

01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:17,840
anybody who has

01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,639
uh

01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,920
been around in the last yeah eight to

01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,600
nine months knows that we're in a global

01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:32,400
pandemic and that has also affected the

01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,400
way that the grid

01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:39,840
needs to supply energy to buildings as

01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:39,840
people change their habits

01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:47,360
to respect stay-at-home orders

01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:49,679
so um naturally in a complicated uh

01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,400
complex sphere there are also going to

01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:54,000
be

01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:58,800
a range of kind of uh technologies

01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:02,719
or um approaches for

01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:05,280
fixing the problems that that arise

01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:07,679
and many of these you've heard of maybe

01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:11,520
some of these you haven't

01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:14,719
but these are all

01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:18,400
trying to take a chunk out of a

01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:18,400
separate aspect of this problem

01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,960
just to kind of go through some of these

01:39:21,710 --> 01:39:26,639
[Music]

01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:28,719
if you want to affect one way to change

01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:32,800
that demand is to change how much a cost

01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:36,239
is to change the price of energy um

01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:39,440
another way is to install solar panels

01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:43,280
at um at a site or to

01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,679
in generation um and uh what i'm what

01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,440
i'm

01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,119
by the way what i'm focusing on here are

01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,440
some of the

01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,440
uh

01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:54,000
solutions which are which focus a little

01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:57,360
bit more on

01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:00,480
the on the demand side so

01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:02,639
uh you could install solar panels um

01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,679
at a specific building you could install

01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:06,480
batteries uh

01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:08,000
increasingly uh batteries are being used

01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:11,520
uh to support the grid not

01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:15,040
only at utilities but also

01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:18,719
distribute at at sites around the grid

01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:21,040
as individual building owners can use

01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:23,600
batteries to consume energy when it's

01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:26,960
less carbon intensive

01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:30,320
or less expensive for the grid um

01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:31,600
and and to rely on their batteries

01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:34,239
stored power

01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:36,239
to shift load from certain times of day

01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:39,119
to other times of day

01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:40,960
when it's less impactful there are

01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:43,280
programs which

01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:45,600
send signals to users and we'll talk a

01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:48,880
little bit more about

01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:53,760
demand response programs that ask

01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:56,480
people to turn off large appliances

01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:57,119
or industrial processes at particular

01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:02,000
times

01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:02,000
of day when there are

01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:06,560
extreme weather events which will only

01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,360
become more frequent

01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,239
in the future um and then there are a

01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:13,440
whole host

01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:15,600
of approaches for for improving the

01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:17,280
efficiency of buildings um at the

01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,239
industrial scale that may be something

01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:22,159
like

01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:24,560
uh changing um compressors

01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:26,560
on uh refrigera refrigeration or

01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:29,920
freezing

01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:33,679
equipment commercial scale that may be

01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:37,040
uh you know uh uh changing

01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:39,199
all of the um uh

01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:41,199
light bulbs in an industrial in a

01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:44,560
warehouse um

01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:46,960
uh or in a grocery store um and

01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,159
and for residences it might mean

01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:51,920
anything from

01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:55,600
um changing uh

01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:59,280
uh insulation to uh

01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:02,400
uh installing new appliances uh

01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:05,199
changing light bulbs there are vast

01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:07,280
variety of approaches here and it's

01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:10,719
important to remember

01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:14,400
when we're thinking about how to

01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:15,360
apply these that they have to work

01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,199
together

01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,800
uh and that some of these will have

01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:22,080
advantages when some

01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:25,119
where where others um

01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:30,239
struggle let me give a really quick

01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:30,239
uh example of that of

01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:36,159
what you're looking at here is a load

01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,159
curve

01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:43,920
that's showing over the course of

01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:46,960
the day the increase in energy usage

01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:50,000
and or at least the consumption on the

01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:53,600
california energy grid

01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:58,080
and the blue line

01:42:53,600 --> 01:43:01,600
is the overall electric load

01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:05,280
and the orange line is that load

01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:08,560
um uh subtracting out the solar

01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:11,840
and the wind generation

01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,840
so what you're actually seeing

01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:21,840
is that

01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:22,400
in the middle of the day there's a lot

01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,600
of

01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:27,520
solar and wind generation and as the day

01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:33,520
winds down

01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:36,480
and as people and businesses

01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:39,199
kind of switch from the end of their

01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:41,440
workday to the start of their evenings

01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:43,040
that there's this ramp when the sun is

01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:45,040
going down

01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,400
and the usage is going and the demand is

01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:49,920
going up and

01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:53,199
you get a really steep um

01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,840
uptick in the amount of energy that's

01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:56,080
required

01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,080
and

01:43:57,199 --> 01:44:00,000
consider because

01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:08,400
the addition of solar and wind resources

01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:10,400
actually makes it

01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,679
makes creates a moment for the grid

01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,159
which is more intense

01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,119
than any other moment which is that

01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:21,840
slope there

01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:21,840
that high rising slope which is

01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:28,000
which is costly for grid operators and

01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,719
very carbon intensive because it

01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,719
requires

01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,440
the types the types of generation that

01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,920
can handle

01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:40,719
a fast increase like that are are

01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:44,560
generally speaking more carbon intensive

01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:46,400
um so as we consider

01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:48,080
the types of things that need to happen

01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,560
to the grid

01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:52,960
we have to consider their impacts not

01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,320
only on the overall load but also the

01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,960
times of day of that load

01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:59,280
the location of that load and the whole

01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:02,960
grid context

01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:05,040
so um

01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,159
back to uh i think something that's

01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:09,760
become a

01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:10,880
a mantra um and uh there's definitely

01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,400
some truth to this

01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,880
if you can't measure it you can't manage

01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:18,639
it um

01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:21,920
why is this relevant

01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:24,400
um we need to

01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,440
understand if we make an attempt to

01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,159
change

01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:29,360
the way that energy is consumed on the

01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:34,800
grid

01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:37,760
that it's important to understand

01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:40,320
that effect the impact of that effect in

01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,320
particular

01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:47,440
what sorts of companies and

01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:50,000
and technologies

01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:51,600
or programs are most effective at

01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
accomplishing their goals what works

01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,679
well

01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,520
what help what helps the grid and what

01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,040
doesn't help the grid

01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:59,440
and how will that change as the grid

01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:02,560
changes

01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:06,000
where what are the marginal impacts

01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:09,440
where are where are the

01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:14,560
are our programs designed to

01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:14,560
to impact demand on the grid

01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:19,119
effective where we hope that they will

01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:22,639
be and during the times of

01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:24,880
of day that we hope that there will be

01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:25,679
to the extent that capital is available

01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,480
for

01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:30,400
investment either from the public or

01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:32,239
private sector

01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:34,239
where should that capital be invested

01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:37,280
and how can it be

01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:38,719
known that that is a wise investment

01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:41,280
how do we promote innovation in the

01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:44,639
space all of these things require

01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:45,119
measuring impacts and that is where the

01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:50,480
opening

01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:50,480
meter comes in the timing is right here

01:46:52,800 --> 01:47:00,080
in in the u.s we're seeing greater than

01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:01,040
60 uh last i heard i'm sure it's higher

01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:04,080
than that now greater

01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:06,800
than 60 coverage of smart meters

01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,600
where previously we do not have hourly

01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,719
data

01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:12,880
now we have lots of data more than more

01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:15,920
than many

01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,920
entities can handle

01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:22,719
and that data tells in great detail

01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,000
patterns of usage even up down to the

01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:26,239
site level

01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,159
uh and that that data is very valuable

01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:31,920
for understanding the impacts

01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:36,239
of of programs or

01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:38,320
technologies or solutions deployed

01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:40,239
to fix demand or supply problems on the

01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:45,280
grid

01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:45,280
so what's hard about measuring things um

01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:51,280
spoiler alert this is where the open e

01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:53,199
meter will come in

01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,920
but some of the things that i've run

01:47:53,199 --> 01:47:57,840
across personally

01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,920
a lot of data is incomplete it's missing

01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:02,159
big sections because of power outages

01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,159
or

01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,600
or it's uh mishandled um during data

01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:10,639
transfers

01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:13,520
or or um

01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,800
um one one issue is that there are lots

01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,520
of different ways

01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,239
of compu of of measuring impact how do

01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,679
you measure it

01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:22,159
um what is it what are the methods you

01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:23,600
use and what do those optimize for what

01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:25,280
what variables are you taking into

01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,920
account um

01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:30,320
who can go in and check that that is

01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:34,639
corr that the methods that you use

01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:34,639
to to compute the impact of an event

01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:41,520
or a program are what you say they are

01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:42,719
um so having the ability to reproduce

01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,360
results

01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:46,000
is extremely important as is the ability

01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:49,679
to

01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,880
do that at scale to take

01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:56,480
um an analysis and repeat it

01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:59,600
for thousands hundreds of thousands

01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:02,639
millions of meters

01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:05,920
across a nation or a state or

01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:08,000
or a jurisdiction um how do you do that

01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:11,440
while respecting the privacy

01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,840
of the individuals um

01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:15,840
uh who's whose data or whose company's

01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:19,440
data

01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:22,800
is required for that analysis

01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:25,920
and and how do you take account of

01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,880
all of the multiple things that are that

01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:29,360
are being done

01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:31,280
as interventions on the grid including

01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:34,239
behavioral

01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:36,719
programs as well as solar installations

01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:40,719
energy efficiency demand response

01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:43,040
and all of that while taking account of

01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:44,960
the changes of energy usage

01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:48,080
that have occurred during the course of

01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,080
this global pandemic

01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:56,000
these are not easy problems

01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:58,880
and uh

01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,760
and that's where it is helpful to have

01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:04,639
software

01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:09,280
that helps make some of these easier

01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:09,280
so a quick side note the open-e meter

01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:15,840
ee stands for energy efficiency

01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:18,159
oops um

01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:19,119
as as time has grown it's it's been

01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:21,679
clear that the opening

01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:23,199
meter is useful for much more than just

01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:24,000
energy efficiency and i want to give you

01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:26,800
a little example

01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,440
of that which is just a taste of where

01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:32,000
we can go

01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:33,920
in the future and and there will be some

01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,599
some suggestions about where where you

01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,800
might go after this

01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:42,080
near the end of these slides so first

01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:44,320
let me talk about demand response

01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,320
it's

01:50:45,119 --> 01:50:50,480
critical to understand the impact of of

01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,119
a demand response event and what you're

01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:58,080
looking at here

01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:58,080
is a load shape over the course of a day

01:50:58,239 --> 01:51:02,080
and on the very bottom what you're

01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:05,280
seeing is is the impact to usage

01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:07,440
in terms of percentages

01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:08,800
and um the analysis that needs to go

01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:13,679
into that you'll see that there

01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,679
are uh kind of uh four

01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:17,280
different uh event time series that that

01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:21,599
go into this and

01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:23,520
and each of these is is made possible by

01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:24,510
by the open e meter which takes into

01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,320
account

01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:28,960
[Music]

01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:29,520
the time the the usage during the time

01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:32,000
of day

01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,760
as as it might have occurred without an

01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,599
event

01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,740
as compared to what actually happened

01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:38,080
during that event

01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:40,080
[Music]

01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:42,239
and and

01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:45,520
[Music]

01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:48,480
additionally subtracts out a

01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:50,320
set of comparisons in order to balance

01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:53,760
out the effect of of any bias

01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:57,280
in a mod in in modeling um

01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:59,520
uh this is one example of

01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:01,119
kind of of one way in which the open eu

01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,960
meter is being used

01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:05,679
for something which is not just energy

01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:09,119
efficiency but which is isolating

01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:10,239
the the effect of of a particular demand

01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:13,920
response event

01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:14,960
uh even on top of um energy efficiency

01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,480
and i'd love to

01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:18,239
talk more about this because feel free

01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:22,400
to reach out to me

01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:25,840
um the open e meter is built on

01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:28,560
um is is really a foundation for

01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:31,119
doing the sort of analysis um which i

01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:34,000
was hinting at um

01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,760
and the keys to this software package

01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,440
are that

01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:43,520
the methods within are replicable

01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:46,639
it's written in code um it's open source

01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,599
um it's uh part of the linux foundation

01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:50,239
um because uh you know we're committed

01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,360
to that

01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:58,480
and that community um it's

01:52:53,360 --> 01:53:01,440
uh it's it's transparent it's it's um

01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:02,560
of course uh each of these things is a

01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:05,280
sliding scale and

01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:05,760
and the open e meter is always trying to

01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,760
uh

01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,520
make things as easy as possible for for

01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:11,599
users to understand

01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:14,719
and par part of the foundation of the

01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:14,719
open e meter is

01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:19,760
the creation of site level

01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,840
seasonal and time of weak and

01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:25,040
temperature baseline models

01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:26,800
now what that means is the open e meter

01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,920
gives you a model of how a building

01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,400
performs

01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:32,639
under a particular set of circumstances

01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:35,280
based on meter data

01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:36,480
um as well as temperature data and time

01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:39,840
of week

01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:40,480
and this is a this is the core component

01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:44,080
from which

01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:47,280
all open e meter analysis

01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:48,639
is performed that this model is used to

01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:52,320
predict

01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:54,719
um the usage uh patterns of a building

01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:56,400
in circumstances which were not actually

01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:58,320
which did not actually occur and we call

01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:01,599
that a counterfactual

01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:03,920
um it's as if

01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:05,199
we wish we could split the universe at

01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,199
the point of an event

01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:08,320
and watch what would have happened with

01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:10,000
that event and

01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:11,760
what would have hap and what did happen

01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:15,520
without that event

01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,320
but unfortunately um we're not able to

01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,320
do that

01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,920
given the constraints of the physical

01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:22,960
world and

01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:23,679
when an event happens that's all that

01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,840
happens and

01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:28,320
and and the opening meter provides a way

01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:30,560
of estimating what might have happened

01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:32,639
um in the absence of that event and that

01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:34,000
is a that is a powerful concept which

01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:37,360
comes together

01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:40,719
um in a number of um

01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:43,199
uh different situations um

01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:43,920
with combinations of different models to

01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:46,400
isolate

01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:48,320
the various effects of energy efficiency

01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,159
demand response

01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:51,520
or storage and load shifting programs

01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:54,719
and

01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,599
all of that is available in the open e

01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:58,960
meter

01:54:55,599 --> 01:55:01,040
let me talk just briefly about the use

01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:04,719
cases that those enable

01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:08,400
so in particular we're starting with

01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:10,560
pay for performance so as

01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,560
as

01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:15,520
companies and innovators sign up for the

01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:19,199
opportunity to

01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:23,040
to show that their their approach

01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:24,800
to affecting the grid has impact

01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,480
that they're willing to bet their

01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:29,360
paycheck on

01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:30,719
that having open source and reliable

01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:33,119
methods becomes

01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:34,639
all the more important this becomes

01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:37,679
important for

01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:39,920
um for the people who are hoping to

01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:43,199
procure

01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:45,360
uh grid impacts of a particular

01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:46,639
sort and who are hoping to invest in

01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:50,000
this

01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:51,280
and as whenever money gets involved it's

01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,199
important to also have

01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:56,320
performance insurance and to understand

01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:56,320
the impacts of those

01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:03,280
of those events uh finally who

01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:05,520
who uses the opening meter this is built

01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:09,679
on standard

01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:12,880
um uh widely used libraries

01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:14,000
um it's a python openmir is it is a

01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,920
python library

01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,599
built on top of pandas and stats models

01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,000
which should be familiar to

01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:21,199
many of the data scientists in the crowd

01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,239
um

01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:26,320
it's uh um

01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:28,159
it's it's possible to get started with

01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:30,239
even just data from a single site

01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:32,000
so we try to make it as easy as possible

01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:33,520
to to get going with the opening meter

01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:38,320
you don't you need not be

01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:40,880
utility to use this um you can be

01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:41,679
someone like me who gets a utility bill

01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,280
um

01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:45,760
and wants to understand how my energy

01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,719
use

01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:52,639
is changing over time and it's built on

01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:52,639
top of public weather sources and now

01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,960
there's a little hint of of how you

01:56:55,199 --> 01:57:00,639
would use it in python

01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,639
just a little um

01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:06,080
a little code snippet for you

01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:09,679
thanks for being here i would love for

01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:11,679
you to go and learn

01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:14,080
a little bit more about the open e meter

01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:16,639
um at the alif energy site

01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:17,760
or follow us on github um get involved

01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:20,800
come to our meetups

01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:22,159
um join our mailing lists um i'm the

01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,639
author of the opening meter and i work

01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:26,400
at recurve

01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:27,679
which incubated and launched the open e

01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:32,159
meter and

01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:34,639
would be happy to answer any questions

01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:35,760
either remotely or through the

01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:39,840
facilitators here

01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,840
so thank you

01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:50,800
we are going from high voltage

01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:51,360
to behind the meter and and how you act

01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:54,159
how we

01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:55,280
actually are going to be able to create

01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:57,360
um

01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:58,400
i think what a lot of folks talk about

01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:01,440
is price

01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:03,520
based grid coordination and

01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,760
open e meter is one of the tools that

01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,520
you need to have in order to be able to

01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:10,639
value

01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:13,920
investments in energy efficiency

01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:13,920
thank you very much phil

01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:21,679
i would like to bring on

01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:25,679
the next one so

01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:28,960
kind of going in the vein around demand

01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:30,560
this next presentation was it's going to

01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:33,760
be stan johnson who

01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:37,040
actually was the developer and

01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:40,639
ralph benner who is uh the

01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:41,840
the executive director of the open adr

01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:45,280
alliance

01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:48,320
so open leader is a full

01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:49,760
complete version of the open adr spec

01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,560
i'm sure they're going to tell you about

01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:53,360
that

01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:54,159
and and also tell you uh what to do with

01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:58,480
that

01:58:54,159 --> 01:59:02,480
and how it is that stan who works for

01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:05,840
a utility in the netherlands and

01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:09,040
is enabling

01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:11,199
um onboarding of e-mobility so i

01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:12,480
hope he goes into all of it thank you

01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:17,840
very much

01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:17,840
theo it let it roll

01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:23,440
hello everybody this is wolf bienert

01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:24,960
technical and managing director of the

01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:26,880
open adr alliance

01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:29,199
i'm happy to be here today to give you a

01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:30,159
brief introduction to the open adr

01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:32,960
standard

01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:33,360
after that stan will continue to give

01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,599
you

01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:37,679
more information on openleader and how

01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:41,760
to actually implement

01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:45,840
the openleader open source protocol

01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:48,960
into a product so let's hop right in

01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:50,159
basically open adr is a non-proprietary

01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:53,040
open standard

01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:54,400
to communicate between demand response

01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:57,840
service providers

01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:58,880
and resources downstream so this is

01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:01,040
typically done

01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:01,920
through this a secure internet

02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,920
connection

02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:05,360
which can already be available at the

02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,679
customer side

02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:09,199
or of course it could be done through a

02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:12,239
dedicated link like

02:00:09,199 --> 02:00:13,760
a cellular modem or things like that in

02:00:12,239 --> 02:00:16,080
rare cases

02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:19,280
typically however it uses already

02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:22,080
existing internet connectivity

02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:22,480
the open adr signal can also be sent to

02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:25,920
an

02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:27,119
aggregation point this aggregation point

02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:30,719
can be either

02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:34,159
a aggregator company or it could just be

02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:35,840
simply a facilitator that receives the

02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:38,960
signal and spreads it out

02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:42,159
to other devices for instance

02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:45,599
you can imagine this like a cloud-based

02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:47,679
thermostat control that being said

02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:49,280
open adr has been around for quite a

02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:52,560
while in fact since

02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:54,560
about 2002 when the concept was

02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:57,840
conceived in california

02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:59,119
after the energy crisis of 2001. so it's

02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,440
been around a while

02:00:59,119 --> 02:01:03,360
but we have improved it over the years

02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:06,400
and since 2013

02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:08,400
now we have the final specifications

02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,679
we are however always looking at

02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:12,400
improvements and

02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:13,440
making sure that things are going the

02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:16,560
way they should

02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:19,440
open adr by now is also an iec

02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:20,800
standard listed there and you can

02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:24,159
purchase it

02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:25,040
at the isc as well so let's look a

02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:28,320
little more at

02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:31,280
the concepts behind open idea we are

02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:32,960
having we are seeing i should say two

02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:36,320
different players here

02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:37,440
the virtual top note the vtn and i

02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:39,679
believe stan will

02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:40,480
also mention these names so it would be

02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:43,520
good

02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:46,239
to to take a good look here

02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:46,639
and the virtual endnote the virtual top

02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:49,280
note

02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:50,560
is a server that manages all the

02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:53,119
resources

02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:54,000
it will create and transmit event

02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:57,199
messages

02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,920
using open adr to the resources

02:01:57,199 --> 02:02:00,880
out in the field it can also request

02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:04,719
reports

02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:08,560
back with feedback from these resources

02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:08,560
the clients the vens

02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:14,159
consequently are part of the resources

02:02:12,239 --> 02:02:16,800
out in the field and they can receive

02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:19,840
these events and will respond to them

02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:22,960
all messages are peer-to-peer there is

02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:25,679
no networking involved at this point

02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:27,360
the services of open adr primarily

02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:29,440
include the event service

02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:30,400
which is very similar to a calendar

02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:33,040
notice

02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:35,280
so you have a start time and end time

02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:37,760
and you can send a number of different

02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:38,639
information elements in there from price

02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:41,599
information

02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:43,599
all the way to specific energy requests

02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,480
everything can be embedded in these

02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:46,960
event

02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:47,520
messages there are a few other services

02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:50,400
here

02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:52,000
but most important aside from the event

02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:55,440
service is the report

02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:57,840
service which provides feedback from the

02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:59,040
from the resources upwards everything is

02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:04,560
xml payloads

02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:07,840
and we secure the links with a tls 1.2

02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:11,040
typically we have seen in the past

02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:14,080
efforts to flatten the peaks in

02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:18,159
a grid connect system really

02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:20,159
only to manage the times where there is

02:03:18,159 --> 02:03:21,199
too much load on the network that was

02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:24,239
the initial

02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:25,360
idea behind open adr starting in 2001

02:03:24,239 --> 02:03:28,880
and 2002.

02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:31,599
however by now we are seeing much more

02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:32,639
out in the field and open adr is being

02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:35,360
used to send

02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:37,679
all kinds of control commands to a

02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:40,880
control systems that in turn

02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:41,679
can then manage other systems like

02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:44,560
storage

02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:45,520
like ev chargers micro grids and so on

02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:47,760
and so forth

02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,560
so all of this is being discussed these

02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:51,440
days

02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:51,840
and a lot of it is already implemented

02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:54,880
one

02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:56,560
example here for instance is electric

02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:59,199
vehicle charging systems

02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:01,119
using open adr to send prices or

02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:04,159
specific energy requests

02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:06,719
and then ocpp from the

02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:08,880
charge station management system to the

02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:10,960
chargers

02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:12,560
thank you very much and i'll turn it

02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:15,440
over now to stan

02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:24,960
for his in-depth presentation of open

02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:26,560
leader and how to implement open adr

02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,320
welcome thank you roll for that

02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:30,159
introduction to openadr

02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:31,440
my name is don johnson and i will show

02:04:30,159 --> 02:04:34,719
you all about

02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:36,480
openleader openleader

02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:39,360
is a python package that allows you to

02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:40,480
quickly integrate open adr communication

02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:44,400
into your existing

02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:46,960
or new projects it supports both clients

02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:48,719
and servers so you can create both ends

02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:49,760
of the communication either for testing

02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:51,840
or pilots

02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:54,239
or whatever suits your application at

02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:54,239
the moment

02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:57,520
it's great for prototyping fast

02:04:56,480 --> 02:05:00,159
iteration

02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:02,480
pilot projects and exploration but it's

02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:03,920
licensed under the apache 2.0 license

02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:07,840
which means it is also

02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,840
applicable for commercial use

02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:12,000
let's dive right in how can you create

02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:15,440
an open adr

02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:19,520
van or client using open leader

02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:19,520
well you need to take these four steps

02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:23,679
you create an open adr client with some

02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:25,440
basic information about your venn

02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:27,199
and the vtn that you want to connect to

02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:30,239
like your van name and

02:05:27,199 --> 02:05:32,159
the vtn url then

02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:34,320
you add you tell the opening to your

02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:36,159
clients which reports you can provide

02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:39,360
and you provide a callback function that

02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:39,360
can generate the values

02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:46,239
you give it a handler that needs to be

02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,239
called whenever an event comes in

02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:50,400
and that's it that's all you need to do

02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:53,119
registration

02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:55,520
message encrypting and authentication

02:05:53,119 --> 02:05:57,440
polling for updates delivering reports

02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:59,199
all of that is taken care of by open

02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:02,400
leader

02:05:59,199 --> 02:06:03,599
now what does it look this is how you

02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:06,400
can get started

02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:07,760
you import the openadr client from

02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,360
openleader

02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,880
you create a client with a van name and

02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:13,520
a vtn url

02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:15,520
and you run it on the python async io

02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:18,719
event loop

02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:21,599
that's it now after you

02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:22,400
run this client here's what happens the

02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:26,239
then

02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:26,719
will first do a oadr query registration

02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:30,400
which

02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:31,599
asks the vtn which protocols it supports

02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:34,960
and some other

02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:36,400
meta information and the vtn will reply

02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:39,760
with a

02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:43,119
oadr created party registration message

02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:46,159
that tells you all about the vtn

02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:47,360
then it decides to register to this vtn

02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:50,000
with the vend name

02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:51,920
the vtm will check it and we'll do some

02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:54,800
validation and authentication

02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:57,599
and it will give you a unique event id

02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:59,440
and a registration id

02:06:57,599 --> 02:07:01,119
now you don't need to remember those ids

02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,920
those are remembered by open leader and

02:07:01,119 --> 02:07:03,679
they are

02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:06,400
incorporated into all of the messages

02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:06,400
that you send out

02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:10,719
and then the event will automatically

02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:13,760
start polling for new messages

02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:15,440
so every for instance 10 seconds it will

02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:18,400
ask the vtn

02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:19,360
do you have anything new for me and it

02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:21,440
can either say

02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:23,840
no when you get an empty response or it

02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:25,920
can say yes i have an event for you

02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:28,639
and then you can get to work dealing

02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:28,639
with that event

02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:36,000
now for security you would not

02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:38,239
just use plain http without any form of

02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,320
authentication so you use

02:07:38,239 --> 02:07:41,840
https and you use client-side

02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:45,119
certificates

02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:48,560
and by simply adding these three lines

02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:49,679
you automatically add tls encryption

02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:52,320
over the connection

02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:53,040
and you automatically sign your xml

02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:56,079
messages

02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:56,880
so the vtn can be sure that they weren't

02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:59,920
tampered with

02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:01,679
in transit and

02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,679
if you also want to check that the

02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:06,239
messages from the vtn

02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:07,199
are actually from the vtn you think it

02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:09,679
is you add

02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:11,520
their fingerprint and it will

02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:13,920
automatically validate that so this is

02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:16,079
this takes care of all of the security

02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:18,320
of your communications in a very elegant

02:08:16,079 --> 02:08:18,320
way

02:08:19,119 --> 02:08:22,960
now the the client is now connected and

02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:24,800
securely connected

02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:28,800
but it's not doing anything useful yet

02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:31,040
so let's add some reporting

02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:34,000
the only thing we need to do is add a

02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:35,760
report so client.ad report

02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,159
we give it a function a callback

02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:42,079
function that can generate the values in

02:08:38,159 --> 02:08:45,119
this case it reads an electricity meter

02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:47,360
we tell it what resource it applies to

02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:49,040
and what what the measurement is in this

02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:51,520
case it's voltage

02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:52,560
and at what sampling rate we can supply

02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:56,880
these

02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:58,960
measurements and that's it

02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:01,360
what happens now after registration is

02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,320
it sends a create report to the vtn that

02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:05,760
contains your

02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:08,000
newly created report the vtn decides if

02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:11,119
it wants to report or not

02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:13,360
and it lets you know and

02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:14,960
if they want it the open leader then

02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:17,520
will automatically set up

02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:18,400
the scheduler that will call your

02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:21,679
function

02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:24,320
to retrieve the values and

02:09:21,679 --> 02:09:26,159
send off the reports to the vtn and then

02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:28,000
the vtn just receives the values which

02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:32,159
is

02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:35,760
pretty straightforward and pretty simple

02:09:32,159 --> 02:09:35,760
and it only took a few lines of code

02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:39,360
and this part in blue of course happens

02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:42,639
over and over at the

02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:42,639
requested report interval

02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:48,800
now we're sending out reports but now we

02:09:46,239 --> 02:09:52,239
also want to handle events that come in

02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:55,679
so we add a handler for the on event

02:09:52,239 --> 02:09:57,679
event in this case

02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:59,199
your handler will simply receive a

02:09:57,679 --> 02:10:02,320
dictionary that contains all of the

02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:04,079
information on the event

02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:05,760
and you can unpack it you can look at

02:10:04,079 --> 02:10:07,599
the signals in the event you can look at

02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:09,440
the individual intervals in the event

02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:12,560
and the values that it sets

02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:12,560
and in this case we

02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:18,320
tell a hypothetical control device to

02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:21,119
execute this schedule in the future

02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:23,040
and we only need to return opt-in or

02:10:21,119 --> 02:10:24,800
opt-out so if you are taking part in

02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:28,000
this event you return opt-in

02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:29,679
and otherwise you return opt-out

02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,880
and openleader will send the correct

02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:32,880
response to the vtn

02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:39,119
that's it now you've integrated

02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:40,400
registration reporting and event

02:10:39,119 --> 02:10:42,400
handling into your venn

02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:43,440
in just a few minutes and just a few

02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:45,280
lines of code

02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:46,800
and all you need to do is focus on your

02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:49,199
own

02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:51,040
device control model which is pretty

02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:52,560
great

02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:54,000
now let's take a look at the other side

02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:56,480
let's take a look at the server the

02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,760
virtual top node

02:10:56,480 --> 02:11:01,840
it's pretty similar you create a openadr

02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:03,520
server with a vtn id this is how you

02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:05,520
identify yourself to the events that

02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:09,040
connect to you

02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:10,880
and you run it and

02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:12,719
now clients can connect but there's

02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,840
nothing much interesting happening so we

02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:16,239
need to

02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:18,239
implement three things which is the

02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:18,880
registrations the reporting and the

02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:22,480
events

02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:23,520
so we add a handler for the party

02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:25,360
registrations

02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:27,360
this will be called whenever a party

02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:30,079
sends a yes i want to register and this

02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:32,719
is my then name

02:11:30,079 --> 02:11:34,079
it calls your callback function with the

02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:36,159
registration info

02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:38,239
you look it up in your database i

02:11:36,159 --> 02:11:40,400
implemented a very

02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:42,079
dummy implementation here that simply

02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:44,800
checks for one van name but

02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:47,360
you would go out and look up in your

02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:50,560
database or something

02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:51,199
and if you if you agree to this then you

02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:54,079
return

02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:55,760
a then id and a registration id to the

02:11:54,079 --> 02:11:57,520
venn that's all you need to do the open

02:11:55,760 --> 02:12:00,320
adr message will be packed up

02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:02,239
automatically or if it's not allowed you

02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:06,880
simply return false and it will reject

02:12:02,239 --> 02:12:08,480
the client

02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:10,480
now then the client is probably going to

02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:11,280
offer you some reports so you add a

02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:15,040
handler

02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:17,199
on register report and

02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:19,840
if you make this handler have the

02:12:17,199 --> 02:12:22,960
signature of resource id measurement

02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:26,239
unit scale minimum and maximum

02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:27,520
sampling intervals then you all then you

02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:29,199
get each measurement

02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:30,800
as a separate call to that function and

02:12:29,199 --> 02:12:31,599
for each of those measurements you can

02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:33,760
decide

02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:35,440
do i want this or do i not want this and

02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:38,159
at what interval do i want to receive

02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:38,159
these reports

02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:43,520
and you again you return a handler that

02:12:42,159 --> 02:12:45,119
will be called whenever one of those

02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:48,800
reports comes in

02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:52,079
and you return a sampling interval

02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:54,560
that's it now one once the event starts

02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:57,520
sending you these update report messages

02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:58,400
your store voltage handler in this case

02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:01,199
will get called

02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:02,400
with the data it receives a list of time

02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:04,719
value pairs

02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:06,400
and you can put them in a database or

02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:09,199
you can analyze them or you can do

02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:12,400
whatever you want with them

02:13:09,199 --> 02:13:13,920
again in just a few lines of code now

02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:15,360
that we received the reports

02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:17,920
you probably want to send out some

02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:19,920
events and that couldn't be easier as

02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:22,079
well

02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:24,639
the only thing you need to do is call

02:13:22,079 --> 02:13:27,199
server dot add event

02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:29,440
add your event details in there so for

02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:32,639
which van is this event meant

02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:34,079
and what type and name of the signal and

02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:35,840
what are the intervals that you're going

02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:37,679
to give it

02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:39,760
and what what is the target of your

02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:41,920
event

02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:43,920
and you also give the callback so that

02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:44,800
once the opt-in or opt-out response

02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:46,639
comes in

02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,560
you'll be notified if the event actually

02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:50,960
took part in it or not

02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:52,719
again it's very simple and this event

02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:57,440
will be put onto a queue

02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:59,199
and whenever the then does the poll

02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:00,960
the automatic queueing mechanism will

02:13:59,199 --> 02:14:02,079
supply this message to the venn

02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:04,719
and everything else happens

02:14:02,079 --> 02:14:04,719
automatically

02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:11,360
let me give you a short demonstration of

02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,159
open leader in action with an actual vtn

02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:14,480
server

02:14:12,159 --> 02:14:16,880
and a vent that controls a controllable

02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:16,880
device

02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:24,639
alright so here i've prepared a

02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:27,760
demonstration setup

02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:29,679
containing an open adr van right here

02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,880
this is a raspberry pi that is running

02:14:29,679 --> 02:14:33,040
the open leader

02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:34,800
software which is connected to this

02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:36,880
energy meter

02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:39,679
and it's connected to this switch which

02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:41,840
controls this flexible device

02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:43,520
we also have a non-flexible device which

02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:46,639
is controlled

02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:49,199
by a manual switch and everything is

02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:52,159
powered by the electricity grid

02:14:49,199 --> 02:14:54,079
now i've designed it in such a way that

02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:56,480
turning on these devices

02:14:54,079 --> 02:14:58,400
will lower the voltage on the on this

02:14:56,480 --> 02:15:01,040
part of the grid

02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:03,360
and that's something that we report to

02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:05,679
the vtn

02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:06,880
and the vtn is set up to receive these

02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:10,159
reports

02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:11,440
it looks at the voltage that is being

02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:15,040
reported

02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:17,679
and whenever it exceeds 230 volts

02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:20,880
the flexible device can turn on and

02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:25,199
whenever it dips below 215 volts

02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:25,199
the flexible device has to turn off

02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:32,719
all right let's see it in action let's

02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:35,840
turn on the non-flexible device

02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:40,000
and let's start up the

02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:42,400
then now in the charts on the left

02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,719
you can see the metering data that is

02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:48,639
coming in

02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:52,719
and this is what the ven is reporting

02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:53,199
to the vtn as we can see we're now using

02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:56,159
about

02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:57,040
four watts and the voltage is a is just

02:15:56,159 --> 02:16:00,079
below

02:15:57,040 --> 02:16:02,079
230. so this is all good

02:16:00,079 --> 02:16:05,840
but it's too low for the flexible device

02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:05,840
to be turned on

02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:10,880
all of this reporting is fully automatic

02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:13,840
the only thing we need to do is register

02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:15,280
our reports set up a handler that reads

02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:16,840
the energy meter

02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:18,480
and everything else happens

02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:21,520
automatically

02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:24,960
now watch what happens if we turn off

02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:24,960
the non-flexible device

02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:37,519
the voltage goes up to above 230

02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:38,399
which triggers an event and that event

02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:40,080
says

02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:43,679
you can turn on your flexible device

02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:43,679
which just happened

02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:50,319
and although that caused the voltage to

02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:52,000
drop below 230 that's no that's no

02:16:50,319 --> 02:16:54,800
problem because that's a safe area for

02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,800
the voltage to be

02:16:55,120 --> 02:17:01,280
if we now turn on the

02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:05,280
non-flexible device you'll notice that

02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:05,280
the voltage dips below 215

02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:10,960
which triggers another event that says

02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:13,359
you have to turn off

02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:16,240
your flexible device and the flexible

02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:16,240
device turns off

02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:21,359
you can also see the status which is

02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:24,479
nicely reported in the bottom

02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:26,639
chart the yellow one and

02:17:24,479 --> 02:17:28,880
this is how easy it is so we've got all

02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:31,840
the facets of open adr

02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:33,200
up and running here we have reporting we

02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:35,200
have events

02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:36,639
we've had the whole registration part

02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:38,319
which we didn't even see because it

02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:41,439
happened automatically

02:17:38,319 --> 02:17:43,760
and it's very easy to just link this up

02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:44,479
to your existing infrastructure whether

02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:46,880
it be

02:17:44,479 --> 02:17:48,080
physical devices like this energy meter

02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:50,000
or this switch

02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:52,719
or whether it be your existing

02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:54,719
infrastructure like this

02:17:52,719 --> 02:17:56,240
time series database that i'm connecting

02:17:54,719 --> 02:17:58,479
to on the vtn

02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:58,479
side

02:17:59,359 --> 02:18:02,719
one more time if we turn off the

02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:05,840
non-flexible device

02:18:02,719 --> 02:18:07,439
the voltage will again rise which will

02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:09,359
trigger an event

02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:11,519
and that event will say you can turn on

02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:14,639
your flexible device now

02:18:11,519 --> 02:18:17,200
and that's what happens so fully

02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:20,319
automatic

02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:23,599
completely compliant open adr

02:18:20,319 --> 02:18:25,599
and super simple to set up i hope this

02:18:23,599 --> 02:18:29,920
gives you a taste of what you can do

02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:29,920
with open adr and with open leader

02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:34,479
now that you've seen what openleader can

02:18:32,479 --> 02:18:36,639
do and how easy it is to get started

02:18:34,479 --> 02:18:37,760
please help us make it even better you

02:18:36,639 --> 02:18:40,479
can find us

02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:41,040
at openleader.org and you can find us on

02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:45,120
github

02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:47,359
at github.com openleader

02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:48,719
i also would like to thank all of the

02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:51,359
other open source

02:18:48,719 --> 02:18:52,080
developers that helped make this what it

02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:55,280
is

02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:56,399
particularly the developers of lxml aio

02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:58,719
http

02:18:56,399 --> 02:18:59,840
and jinja 2. those are at the heart of

02:18:58,719 --> 02:19:02,880
the open leader

02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:04,399
package and of course this entire video

02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:06,240
presentation was also made

02:19:04,399 --> 02:19:08,160
using open source software so thank you

02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:10,639
for that

02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:11,920
in closing i'd like to thank the linux

02:19:10,639 --> 02:19:16,080

02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:23,200
for their technical support as well

02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:24,080
thank you very much for watching this

02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:35,679
presentation

02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:38,880
and we hope to hear from you soon

02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:42,559
that's great um

02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:45,920
you know uh ralph has been

02:19:42,559 --> 02:19:49,359
uh working with open adr for such a long

02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:52,479
uh you know he he's he has really

02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:53,920
held um that organization together and

02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:57,120
brought it out into the world

02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:58,319
and um this partnership with a lot and

02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:02,080
with stan

02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:05,760
is great um because there is now a

02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:08,560
fully compliant open adr uh

02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:09,600
client and server and um just to give

02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:12,880
you a sense

02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:15,359
so that's how electric charging

02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:16,240
is being managed by the distribution

02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:19,680
utilities

02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:23,120
in the netherlands open adr

02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:27,040
is the protocol that japan is using

02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:30,319
to onboard distributed energy resources

02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:32,960
open adr is how

02:20:30,319 --> 02:20:34,399
much of the united states manages um

02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:38,240
demand response

02:20:34,399 --> 02:20:41,520
so there you have it um we we now have

02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:44,880
a global industrial strength

02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:49,439
open adr open leader that was great

02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:49,439
so the last video we have is

02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:56,080
is operator fabric and the story that i

02:20:54,479 --> 02:20:58,560
can tell about operator fabric

02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:59,120
was the first time that i came to paris

02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:03,439
to meet

02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:06,319
um the uh rte and and the folks from

02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:07,760
uh who who were building uh the software

02:21:06,319 --> 02:21:08,080
within and they were like going you know

02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:10,479
we

02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:11,200
we want to move to open source and rit

02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:14,399
really was the

02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:18,399
founding utility and

02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:23,120
um boris and guillaume

02:21:18,399 --> 02:21:25,040
and uh and benoit all came together and

02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:26,880
kind of did these demonstrations of

02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:30,560
operator fabric and i went

02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:32,640
wow this is really amazing these guys

02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:34,800
have a vision of the future

02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:36,000
and of the future of the control room

02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:40,000
and

02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:41,040
so please this last demonstration is uh

02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,399
boris dolly

02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:55,760
and hannah safi and they are going to

02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:58,560
take you through operator fabric

02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:59,920
hello my name is boris i work in the

02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:01,920
french tso

02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:03,120
transmission system operator which is

02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:06,319
rte

02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:08,720
as a project manager today

02:22:06,319 --> 02:22:10,880
i'm gonna show you what is operator

02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:14,479
fabric the smart assistant

02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:16,960
for utility system operators

02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:19,359
first i'll try from a theoretical point

02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:22,479
of view to answer those questions

02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:23,760
what is operator fabric about what does

02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:26,080
it look like

02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,880
how does it work from a software

02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:29,120
architecture

02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:30,479
point of view and what is the technology

02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:33,840
stack

02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:35,600
why should you use it and join the open

02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:38,800
source community

02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:39,600
and then an a will show you a real use

02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:42,640
cases

02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:44,000
demonstration what is a fab about you

02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:46,560
can read up fab and

02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,640
and hear up fab because we use the short

02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:51,040
name of operator fabric and if you use

02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:53,439
it a lot you can call it of

02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:55,600
the purpose of upfab is to provide the

02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:57,840
right information to the right person

02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:59,840
at the right time as i told you it's

02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:03,359
very theoretical but you see

02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:06,720
it make a lot of sense by the way

02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:10,000
we reduce the number of operators screen

02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:12,479
as you can see on this picture you have

02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,280
the control room with a lot of screens

02:23:12,479 --> 02:23:16,479
facing

02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:18,720
the operator and then we have less

02:23:16,479 --> 02:23:21,920
screen and a key screen is

02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:25,280
the operator fabric screen the goals

02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:25,920
for a utility system whatever is the

02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:29,600
business

02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:32,240
either water gas or electricity

02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:33,680
is to improve the coordination between

02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:37,359
actors

02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:41,040
of different trades in a company

02:23:37,359 --> 02:23:44,560
inside a same trade it's easy

02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:47,200
to coordinate operators but

02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:49,280
among different traits it's a real

02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:50,560
challenge and operator fabric is a great

02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:53,200
tool for that

02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:54,240
it offers the centralization of all the

02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:58,000
information for

02:23:54,240 --> 02:24:01,040
a business process and thanks to that

02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:04,000
you can capitalize on decision you can

02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:06,319
analyze what happened when why if you

02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,800
try to do it with a classical control

02:24:06,319 --> 02:24:10,240
room

02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:11,840
with phone calls it's hard to capitalize

02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:14,800
on decisions

02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:16,160
it's a cyber secured tool because it

02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:19,520
assets

02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:22,040
each year the code and the architecture

02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:23,200
and it offers of course transparency

02:24:22,040 --> 02:24:27,439
interoperability

02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:31,359
etc etc what does it look like

02:24:27,439 --> 02:24:35,200
on the left this is the main feature

02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:38,720
the card feed you have notification

02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:42,160
in operator fabric represented by

02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:45,280
cards one card is one notification

02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:48,720
for an operator and one card represents

02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:51,840
a state of a process at the time

02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:52,800
you are watching it so we have four

02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:56,399
columns

02:24:52,800 --> 02:25:00,160
first red then orange blue

02:24:56,399 --> 02:25:03,840
and green it's a severity level

02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:07,120
red level means you as an operator

02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:10,560
we need you to take decision or make an

02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:14,240
action orange you have

02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:16,319
to know what happened on this process

02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:17,520
blue it's an information about the

02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:19,840
process

02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,280
and green it's an information that you

02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:24,479
are waiting

02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:26,880
for on a process it's okay but you

02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:28,560
need to know that this is okay on the

02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:30,880
right side of the screen

02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:33,359
in this pane you see when you click on a

02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:36,000
card the detail of a card

02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:37,040
you can of course just read the message

02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:40,080
or interact

02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:43,520
with this message and then

02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:44,800
the last part is the timeline here is

02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:48,399
the real time view

02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:52,080
rt as you can see here and you have

02:25:48,399 --> 02:25:55,200
bubbles which are the time viewing

02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:56,960
of the card notification you can click

02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:00,240
on that and go to the cards

02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:03,680
of course and you have a day view

02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:06,080
seven day view which is the business

02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:07,600
week and you have the week the monsoon

02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:10,720
and year if you want

02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:14,240
from a software architecture perspective

02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:17,520
operator fabric is very simple why

02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:20,479
because operator fabric is able to

02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:22,000
send a card by itself we call it free

02:26:20,479 --> 02:26:24,960
messages

02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,520
but the goal of a period of fabric is to

02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:29,280
receive

02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:32,240
notification through rest apis

02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:35,120
so it's a very low cost to bring a pair

02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:38,720
of fabric in your it system because your

02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:42,240
application are maybe already ready to

02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:45,120
send a notification through rest apis

02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:46,319
so you can bring into your control room

02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:49,680
really easily

02:26:46,319 --> 02:26:52,640
and that's what we did the technology

02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:53,359
stack is at this state of art it's a web

02:26:52,640 --> 02:26:56,880
application

02:26:53,359 --> 02:27:00,840
so it's a java and spring development

02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:03,520
and there is a full ci cd

02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:05,600
solution so

02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:06,560
you can find everything on the code on

02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:09,359
our github

02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:10,880
and on the website the git pages site

02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:12,880
you can find everything about the

02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:16,399
community this community is

02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:18,479
a very dynamic and very professional

02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:20,399
the license of the software is mozilla

02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:23,439
public license version 2

02:27:20,399 --> 02:27:26,880
and we really would like you to jump in

02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:29,280
so take it with you and go back to us

02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:31,840
and i your turn you can go live for the

02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:31,840
demo

02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:39,200
so thanks boris for this great

02:27:36,479 --> 02:27:41,600
interesting introduction of the main

02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:44,960
concepts of operator fabric

02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:46,080
i'm an asap the current product owner of

02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:48,560
operator fabric

02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:49,840
and i'm really thrilled today to make

02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:52,399
this demo

02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:53,439
so first before starting i just would

02:27:52,399 --> 02:27:56,160
like to

02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:57,040
make a short disclaimer so the two use

02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:59,439
cases that i'm

02:27:57,040 --> 02:28:00,160
about to show you today are highly

02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:03,520
inspired

02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:05,920
from real ones but we've made

02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:08,399
some modifications to make it simple for

02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:11,760
those who are noticing the energy field

02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:14,720
and also for confidentiality

02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:16,479
matters so the first example that i want

02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:19,680
to show you today is about

02:28:16,479 --> 02:28:20,319
igcc which stands for international grid

02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:23,280
control

02:28:20,319 --> 02:28:24,560
cooperation i will start first by giving

02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:27,840
some background

02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:31,040
information about igcc so each

02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:32,880
transmission system operator like rte

02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:35,520
has the responsibility to keep the

02:28:32,880 --> 02:28:37,520
voltage and frequency at a certain level

02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:39,520
and ensure that the equilibrium between

02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:42,560
the consumption and the production

02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:43,359
is met so when there is an imbalance

02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:46,000
between

02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:46,640
production and consumption frequency and

02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,120
voltage

02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:49,840
change in the grid and if nothing is

02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:53,280
done

02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:56,560
it can lead at some point to a blackout

02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:58,960
so to avoid this kind of situations tso

02:28:56,560 --> 02:29:01,200
have established several mechanisms

02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:04,240
and among them there is what we call the

02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:07,840
automatic frequency restoration process

02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:11,040
which aim is to restore the frequency

02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:13,600
hertz so long story short this

02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:15,280
mechanism consists in injecting or

02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:18,080
withdrawing electric

02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:18,960
call power in the grid to restore the

02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:21,359
frequency

02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:22,399
level this mechanism has been

02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:25,920
streamlined

02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:29,359
to be performed at the european grid

02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:33,040
level to ensure more cooperation between

02:29:29,359 --> 02:29:36,160
tsos and is now known under the name of

02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:39,120
igcc so every country compute

02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:40,399
the power they can provide to the grid

02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:43,200
if there is a need to

02:29:40,399 --> 02:29:46,000
restore the frequency the igcc energy

02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:47,680
quantity is computed several times a day

02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:51,680
and takes into account

02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:55,600
the events that occur in the grid system

02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:59,359
so in my example i will show you

02:29:55,600 --> 02:30:02,319
a screen of an operator

02:29:59,359 --> 02:30:03,280
who will receive information about the

02:30:02,319 --> 02:30:06,800
igcc

02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:10,000
level throughout the day so now i'm

02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:10,479
i'm logging in the first in the main

02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,840
page

02:30:10,479 --> 02:30:17,120
of retro fabric and i will

02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:21,760
simulate an apa call from

02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:24,800
a third app informing about

02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:27,920
the rgcc level

02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:31,040
so as you have seen

02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:34,399
my my user have just received a new card

02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:34,720
about the igcc saying there is we have

02:30:34,399 --> 02:30:38,479
to

02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:42,000
lower the the level we can't uh provide

02:30:38,479 --> 02:30:44,399
more 300 megawatts and

02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,160
let's say that during the day there is a

02:30:44,399 --> 02:30:49,439
contingency or a critical

02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:52,640
situation and we can no longer

02:30:49,439 --> 02:30:56,240
participate to this mechanism

02:30:52,640 --> 02:31:00,240
so this card will be updated

02:30:56,240 --> 02:31:04,080
and as you have seen the card moved from

02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:07,760
orange to red to warn the operator

02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:08,160
that there is an issue and the quantity

02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:11,280
now

02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:14,640
is equal to zero so let's say

02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:17,520
at the final step that we've made some

02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:18,960
the situation has changed and is now

02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:22,720
back to normal

02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:25,680
so the igcc level is recomputed

02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:26,880
again to take into account the new

02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:30,000
situation

02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:33,120
and card will now be

02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:36,960
updated and it will

02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:40,319
turn to green to say that well

02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:43,680
everything is good we can participate

02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:44,640
can go back to the normal level and we

02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:47,760
can participate

02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:48,399
to restore the frequency level if needed

02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:52,000
so

02:31:48,399 --> 02:31:56,319
as you can see a card can be updated

02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:59,920
to to inform about new situations and

02:31:56,319 --> 02:32:03,200
uh what i want to also to notice is that

02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:05,040
in the same screen and that is really

02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:08,080
the power of operator fabric

02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:11,359
is that we can receive data and

02:32:08,080 --> 02:32:13,840
updates from several apps

02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:14,960
uh such as in this example um i'm

02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:18,240
receiving

02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:18,800
information about igcc but at the same

02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:21,520
time

02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:22,640
i can receive information about network

02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:27,120
contingencies

02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:30,560
planned outages the electricity forecast

02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:32,960
conception and now i suggest to move

02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:35,280
to the second one throughout this

02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:37,920
example what i want to show you

02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:39,280
is how we can use operator fabric

02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:41,120
facilitate

02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:42,720
and to make easy the coordination

02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:46,160
between different

02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:49,200
entities it's a pretty basic example

02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:51,600
it's not linked one hundred percent

02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:53,280
to the electrical field it's made on

02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:55,680
purpose to show you that

02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:56,560
we can use operator fabric in different

02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:59,840
contexts

02:32:56,560 --> 02:33:00,640
so let's move to operator fabric now i

02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:04,080
will

02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:07,680
log in with another user who is

02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:10,800
from a nighty supervision center

02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:14,319
let's say he has noticed an issue

02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:18,479
in the network and he wants

02:33:14,319 --> 02:33:21,680
to notify different control rooms about

02:33:18,479 --> 02:33:25,280
this issue this time i won't make

02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:28,880
i won't simulate a third app

02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:31,439
but i will do it uh by manually

02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:33,600
by creating a card directly from

02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:34,880
operator fabric so in case for instance

02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:38,720
of remembrancy

02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:43,200
of our typical situation we can use

02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:43,200
the card creation feature so

02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:50,960
let's say this is a critical

02:33:46,479 --> 02:33:55,280
issue so it will be an alarm and

02:33:50,960 --> 02:33:58,880
say it's a network slowdown

02:33:55,280 --> 02:34:02,080
investigation let's say that it has

02:33:58,880 --> 02:34:06,160
an impact on app a app

02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:09,040
b or service a surface b whatever

02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:10,720
and uh i will send this card to the

02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,040
control room one

02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:14,080
and control room two because i think

02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:17,120
that uh

02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:20,720
there they are the ones who are uh

02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:24,800
involved and impacted by uh

02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:28,160
this uh issue

02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:31,439
so i will send the card

02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:35,120
see that card has been created

02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:38,720
and now i will log out and log in

02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:39,359
as operator one who belongs to the

02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:42,960
control

02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:46,319
control room one and

02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:49,359
i will take i will see

02:34:46,319 --> 02:34:53,280
uh the card coming

02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:57,120
yes i can response to this card

02:34:53,280 --> 02:35:00,160
uh to give maybe further information

02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:04,399
and to respond to answer

02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:07,840
to it supervisor that i have noticed

02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:10,960
also issues on service

02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:12,000
c for instance i will validate the

02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:16,640
answer as you can

02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:17,920
see we can the the answer is my answer

02:35:16,640 --> 02:35:20,960
is displayed

02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:24,080
and the name of my control

02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:27,359
room turns to green to say that i have

02:35:24,080 --> 02:35:31,600
answered to this card so

02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:35,439
what i suggest is to log out

02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:39,040
and connect as

02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:40,560
operator to who belongs to the control

02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:44,880
room too

02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:48,800
you see he has also received this card

02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:52,399
and he can see that the control room uh

02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:57,600
one has already responded to this card

02:35:52,399 --> 02:36:01,359
he can give his own point of view of

02:35:57,600 --> 02:36:03,520
the impact that he has noticed let's say

02:36:01,359 --> 02:36:05,439
he's sharing the same point of view with

02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:09,200
the control room one

02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:12,720
so i will take these three boxes

02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:15,840
and validate my answers so

02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:16,800
as you might see control room 2 has

02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:20,160
turned

02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:23,920
to green as well as long as

02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:26,640
the operator has responded to the card

02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:27,680
so and let's say this card will be

02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:30,560
updated when

02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:31,359
the issue will be resolved and it will

02:36:30,560 --> 02:36:34,399
turn

02:36:31,359 --> 02:36:37,680
to green to say okay

02:36:34,399 --> 02:36:41,520
everything is back to

02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:44,560
normal so i hope that through this

02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:47,680
second example you have seen how

02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:51,760
we can use operator fabric as

02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:54,560
a coordination tools

02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:55,200
so that brings us to the end of this

02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:58,080
demo

02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:59,120
and the end of this presentation i hope

02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:02,479
that it has been

02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:05,600
very informative on behalf of

02:37:02,479 --> 02:37:07,520
operator fabric team rte and lf

02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:08,960
energy i would like to thank you for

02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:11,280
your attention

02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:12,000
um you will remain at your disposal if

02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:14,399
you have

02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,600
any question or any suggestion we'll be

02:37:14,399 --> 02:37:18,960
more than happy

02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:21,280
to discuss it with you thank you very

02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:21,280
much

02:37:29,439 --> 02:37:34,080
you know it makes me so happy to see all

02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:37,680
that

02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:41,120
oh my god you know

02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:41,840
um these guys have come a really long

02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:45,040
way

02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:48,479
uh open source and utilities

02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:52,960
have it's a pretty new

02:37:48,479 --> 02:37:54,960
innovation you have an industry globally

02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:56,080
in which for the most part have been

02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:59,359
dominated by

02:37:56,080 --> 02:38:02,640
a few vendors and

02:37:59,359 --> 02:38:05,200
in which regulators have in many ways

02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:06,000
taken away the capacity of utilities to

02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:09,760
be able to

02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:12,240
actually lead and do their work at the

02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:15,439
speed of technology so

02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:16,399
these guys are breaking down walls and

02:38:15,439 --> 02:38:18,880
you can hear

02:38:16,399 --> 02:38:21,040
the joy and excitement and enthusiasm

02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:22,240
what they're doing so i really want to

02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:25,359
invite you all

02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:28,000
uh to uh take a look so i'm gonna close

02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:32,240
with just a couple of um

02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:35,760
um just a couple of things before i

02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:37,920
leave before we all leave okay

02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:39,680
and you know again if you want to leave

02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:42,080
a question please do

02:38:39,680 --> 02:38:44,160
so i want to let you know about how to

02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:48,479
do code contributions

02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:51,760
um lf energy is growing as you saw

02:38:48,479 --> 02:38:54,240
with the you know pretty large

02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:54,960
functional architecture we're talking

02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:57,840
about a

02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:58,080
microservices environment that you know

02:38:57,840 --> 02:38:59,600
i

02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:01,600
i can kind of imagine what will be

02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:03,840
different about lf energy and the other

02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:05,840
projects that the linux foundation is

02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:08,160
we probably will have hundreds of

02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:09,920
projects we have two projects that are

02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:12,240
starting up right now

02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:14,560
that are actually based on code from

02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:16,560
other foundations and so we're learning

02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:17,920
how to do that we're learning how to

02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:19,600
compose the future

02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:22,000
there's a new project that's coming in

02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:23,280
that's a multi-protocol gateway that's

02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:25,359
based on fledge

02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:26,640
which is an lf edge and we have another

02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:28,960
project it's a

02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:30,880
digital bill of material which is around

02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:32,880
supply chain security

02:39:30,880 --> 02:39:34,080
that's coming out of the d-bomb

02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:36,479
consortium

02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:38,240
so they're basically two ways that

02:39:36,479 --> 02:39:39,600
projects come into the foundation one is

02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:41,439
through special interest groups or

02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:43,760
working groups and the other one

02:39:41,439 --> 02:39:46,240
is through you know project proposal

02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:50,280
that comes directly in

02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:51,520
so you can go to the wiki and it's

02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:55,120
wiki.lfg.org

02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:56,640
and you will see that there's a project

02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:59,920
proposal process

02:39:56,640 --> 02:40:03,080
um please take a look at it and we're

02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:07,040
really interested in any software

02:40:03,080 --> 02:40:08,800
contributions so um

02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:11,359
please take a look if that's of interest

02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:13,680
to you and let's see

02:40:11,359 --> 02:40:13,680
um

02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:19,359
join our community so if you go to

02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:23,760
lfnergy.org

02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:26,960
join us i'm sorry lfnergy.org

02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:29,920
community you will see that we've

02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:31,760
really done our best to get organized

02:40:29,920 --> 02:40:34,160
set up your community and communication

02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:36,399
channels learn about the frameworks

02:40:34,160 --> 02:40:37,680
join a special interest group starter

02:40:36,399 --> 02:40:40,800
working

02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:41,680
start working on a project you can see

02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:43,680
that

02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:45,279
links to the wiki to the mailing list

02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:47,279
and to slack

02:40:45,279 --> 02:40:48,399
you know we're at the very beginning the

02:40:47,279 --> 02:40:50,640
next 10 years

02:40:48,399 --> 02:40:52,000
are going to be the most important 10

02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:55,359
years in humanity

02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:58,160
in many ways and um so

02:40:55,359 --> 02:40:59,279
you know communicating with you all and

02:40:58,160 --> 02:41:02,160
sharing this

02:40:59,279 --> 02:41:02,800
it you know it is a thrill of a lifetime

02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:05,600
for me

02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:07,600
and i know for all of the developers and

02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:10,880
power system engineers

02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:14,000
that you saw tonight um so go jump in

02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:15,600
get involved we're just beginning it's a

02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,880
little bit like a frontier town

02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:20,960
sometimes

02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:22,800
but you know we're getting it um

02:41:20,960 --> 02:41:24,080
you know like in any of the other

02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:26,560
foundations

02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:27,120
you know the idea is 80 percent open

02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:31,120
source

02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:33,279
20 competing on products and services

02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:34,640
and you know this leverage development

02:41:33,279 --> 02:41:37,920
model is

02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:39,840
really alive and well in lf energy and

02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:42,560
that is where the cooperation and the

02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:45,359
collaboration is getting built

02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:47,120
and that is what an open source opens

02:41:45,359 --> 02:41:50,720
open source software access

02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:54,560
ecosystem looks like i'm getting tired

02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:55,120
um so uh i but i'm really excited by

02:41:54,560 --> 02:41:57,040
this

02:41:55,120 --> 02:42:00,399
so and i think that you all know what

02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:03,439
the benefits of the linux foundation are

02:42:00,399 --> 02:42:04,880
so i'm going to keep moving what i do

02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:06,640
want to share with you

02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:08,960
is kind of our membership and

02:42:06,640 --> 02:42:11,840
participation levels

02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:13,760
really we have two tiers we have a

02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:16,319
strategic membership tier

02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:18,479
and we have a general membership here

02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:19,040
all of this is on our website it's all

02:42:18,479 --> 02:42:22,080
posted

02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:25,279
you can find it all please

02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:26,560
come and join us absolutely any project

02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:29,040
is open

02:42:26,560 --> 02:42:29,600
you don't have to be a member to join

02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:31,279
just like

02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:33,279
all the other projects at the linux

02:42:31,279 --> 02:42:34,880
foundation but part of what's really

02:42:33,279 --> 02:42:35,439
important and special about what's

02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:39,200
happening

02:42:35,439 --> 02:42:43,600
here in lf energy is that we really are

02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:45,680
creating um a community that is going to

02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:47,920
transform the power systems on the

02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:50,640
planet and are going to enable

02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:51,520
in that way automobile companies to

02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:53,200
transform

02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:54,800
because if the grids aren't ready for

02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:56,880
the automobiles

02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:57,840
then how are you going to charge the

02:42:56,880 --> 02:43:00,640
automobiles

02:42:57,840 --> 02:43:02,160
so we're kind of in this together and

02:43:00,640 --> 02:43:03,279
you know i would also say that with

02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:06,319
regards to

02:43:03,279 --> 02:43:08,080
cloud and to you know infrastructure and

02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:10,640
large computing systems

02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:11,200
we have to figure out how to create you

02:43:10,640 --> 02:43:14,479
know

02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:17,439
carbon neutral carbon negative computing

02:43:14,479 --> 02:43:18,080
infrastructure and where i think you

02:43:17,439 --> 02:43:20,640
know

02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:21,279
by some estimates five to eight percent

02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:23,439
of

02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:25,359
the planet's energy is going to

02:43:23,439 --> 02:43:26,319
computing or is going to be going to

02:43:25,359 --> 02:43:29,439
computing

02:43:26,319 --> 02:43:31,040
and yes we are probably going to double

02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:32,720
the amount of energy that we're going to

02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:35,520
consume in the next

02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:36,000
30 years so in order to be able to do

02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:38,319
that we

02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:39,760
have to get really good at onboarding

02:43:38,319 --> 02:43:42,160
renewable energy

02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:43,200
and being able to orchestrate devices

02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:46,240
and that energy

02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:48,240
so come and join our community it's the

02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:50,800
best place to learn how to do it

02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:53,279
and to be part of it we are going to

02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:56,479
change the world and

02:43:53,279 --> 02:43:59,760
