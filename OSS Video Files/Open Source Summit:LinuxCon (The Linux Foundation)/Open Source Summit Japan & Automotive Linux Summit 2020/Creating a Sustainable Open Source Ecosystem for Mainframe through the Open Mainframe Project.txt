hello and welcome to

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,599
this talk creating a sustainable open

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,840
source ecosystem

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,880
for mainframe through the open mainframe

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,720
project

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,800
my name is john murcik and i'm director

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,039
of the open mainframe project on behalf

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,359
of the linux foundation

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,640
when people ask about open source and

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,400
mainframe

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,920
you get sometimes a really confused look

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,279
on people's face

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
how do these things even collect

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,120
connected how is

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
how is even the concept of of open

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
source and mainframe i mean mainframe

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,559
just seems so disconnected from

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,079
where all of it is and the entire open

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,120
source movement

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,800
well what's interesting is if you talk

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,039
to somebody in mainframe

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,320
and you bring up any technology trend

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
they will tell you

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,199
that oh geez we did this in mainframe a

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,440
decade ago or two decades ago

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,120
and as it turns out open source is

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,840
exactly the same if you look at the

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,600
roots of the open source movement they

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,760
trace all the way back

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,200
to share in the 1950s and

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
if you think about where they were at

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,560
the time here there's a new computer

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,600
coming from ibm

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,119
called the ibm model 704 and

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,280
a whole group of users trying to

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,240
understand how this machine works

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,600
what are best practices and all these

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
pieces some of the same challenges we

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,680
have around technology today

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,680
and so they got together in a room in

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,799
santa monica california

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
and shared code with one another shared

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,920
tips and tricks they shared

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,240
ideas and this here

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
we traced back here the linux foundation

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,040
as the historical root

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
of open source back in 1955 with this

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,399
user group

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
of share and share is still around today

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,280
shares a

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,479
a biannual event that still happens to

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,280
this day

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,079
and it's really interesting you know

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,079
this just

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,200
very simple of sharing code again not

00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,920
the same way that we might have done it

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,600
today you

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
wouldn't didn't have the internet to

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,799
share on so maybe they'd be sharing you

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
know physical media

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
tapes and whatnot but it's that same

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,520
concept

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,800
of collaboration around code

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,400
and that long heritage from the ibm

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
model 704

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
to today of the modern mainframe it

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
really harkens and talks about the the

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
strengths of what this platform is all

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
about

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,360
and it's all built around really

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,599
four key principles security performance

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
availability and scalability

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,720
and if you look at these specs here

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,680
listed on the screen

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,560
that screams that all to you if you're

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,560
in the market

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,840
for a machine that needs all four of

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
those points

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
turned up to an 11 this is the hardware

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
for you

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,400
and this hardware is an amazing platform

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,160
for linux and open source but let's look

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,800
back let's look back at

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,680
how those early meetings those early

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,120
gatherings

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,640
of a user group in 1955 got to where

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,080
we're at today

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,200
and if you've moved forward 20 years

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,879
all of a sudden the share user group

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,519
was having all sorts of momentum and all

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,239
sorts of code developed

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,760
and the biggest challenge was how to

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
chronicle all this together

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,959
you know as opposed to having just

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,640
bespoke collaboration

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
how can we all bring this into something

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,080
canonical to share

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,640
well a project called cbt tape and cbt

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
state

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,400
cbt stands for connecticut bacon trust

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,080
which is a

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
a bank that has been defunct for many

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
many years

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,319
there is mainframe programmers at that

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,120
bank that saw the value in pulling this

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,400
together

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,159
and having a canonical distribution of

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,720
all of these scripts that have been put

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,200
together during these share events and

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,680
elsewhere in the community and since

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,319
1975 have been releasing

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
this volume of all these things out to

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,080
the community to use

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,519
at the time it was on tape um over time

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
it's you know became on other mediums

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,159
and yet and even

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,360
you can download it right from the

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
internet itself and right from their

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
website

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,000
and we're at the open mainframe project

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
are really privileged that that project

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
actually came to the open mainframe

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,320
project

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,840
earlier this year and we now host this

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,560
effort

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,519
from this great community that has been

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,199
working with us

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,880
and really shepherding this for decades

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,280
now and we're happy to be the home of

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,280
that going forward

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,520
we fast forward a few decades late 90s

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,800
we know linux was coming on the scene

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,160
and linux itself was ported to the s390x

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
platform which is sort of the

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,320
architecture indicator for the mainframe

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,840
platform and it was done by many folks

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
in the community there was a community

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,880
efforts there was uh work from marist

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,520
university

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
the ibm germany offices and other folks

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
out there

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
and it all accommodates linux being

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
supported on this platform

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
and then as we get into the early 2000s

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,160
we see suse

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
stepping forward is really the first

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,800
major linux distribution to support

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
the s390x architecture along with red

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,919
hat and debian and

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,800
many others to follow from there and

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,400
as linux came to this platform just as

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,039
when linux has came to so many other

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
places

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,639
it begins to thrive 2006 1700 customers

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,960
already using it in production

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,039
and in 2013 we already see the open

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,160
source ecosystem hitting a very critical

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,400
mass

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
mass already so

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
the interesting thing here is what we

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
see is open source is not slowing down

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,240
anytime soon

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,160
and what the true challenge ahead of us

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,120
here is sort of understanding why that

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,240
is and for a mainframe world that is

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,199
thinking of such

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,320
applications is very proprietary you

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,600
know when they back look into some of

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
their code they're realizing wow there's

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
a lot of open source in here

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
and we sometimes call this the code club

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,120
sandwich where

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,479
you see a layer of open source which is

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
sort of an underlying framework that

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,840
powers your application

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
and then that layer of business logic

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,759
that magic of

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,759
the value of what this application is

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
and then open source code is libraries

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,960
is the ones that do all the

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,319
interconnections and the other

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,560
points that are just required for an

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,720
application to function where

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,400
if you can if you put all that together

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,840
open source code is roughly 90

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,280
of an application so with this in mind

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,880
you can see that open source is

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,160
isn't slowing down anytime soon there's

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,319
nothing but frameworks there's nothing

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
but libraries to connect pieces in there

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
and it's enabling so much innovation to

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,360
happen the real challenge

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,039
becomes which projects matter and the

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,759
truth is all projects matter to some

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,759
degree

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,840
but there's certain projects that have a

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
huge amount of value to our society to

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
move forward

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,759
and the answer for that always is

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,840
projects with sustainable ecosystems

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,000
and we at the open mainframe project

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,240
believe that the successful projects

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
always depend on members developers and

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,280
standards and all those infrastructure

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,400
really the top portion of that circle to

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,919
be successful

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,919
and the way that these become successful

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,599
is by them turning into products

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,599
whether that be internal usage with an

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,319
organization or a vendor taking it to

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,160
market

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,759
either way that's deriving an economic

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,000
benefit in the form of

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,280
lower r d costs more addressable market

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,800
faster time to market and that economic

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,560
benefit is driven back in the project

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
with that circle and that's what we call

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,240
a sustainable ecosystem

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,880
and that circle continues indefinitely

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,919
and that's

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,919
really what the definition of

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,560
sustainability is it's the property of

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,639
systems to remain diverse and productive

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,240
indefinitely how can we ensure these

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,400
technologies maintain

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,520
for a long period of time which if you

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,160
think about that's the mainframe in

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,520
general it's

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,039
a technology been around for decades and

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,560
our challenge here at the open mainframe

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,319
project is how do we make that a

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,560
sustainable thing because already so

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,160
much of the world depends upon this

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,160
technology now if we

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,280
roll back five years ago when the open

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
mainframe project was founded in 2015.

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,039
you know we took a little bit of a look

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,160
at the lay of the land

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,759
of open source in the mainframe and

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,280
this pyramid kind of represents a lot of

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,280
ecosystems we look at

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,039
of really were the challenges and it's

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,639
never that open source isn't there

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,240
but it's running into challenges to get

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,840
to that next level

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
it could be something as simple as just

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,919
fragmentation of the market and

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,440
these these various applications and

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,199
projects just don't interoperate with

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,639
one another very well

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,240
could be the challenges of governance

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,560
how do you get involved in a project how

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
do you

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,200
obtain committer access how do you help

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,760
set the direction of where it's going

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,519
maybe the project itself is not really

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
focused on building an ecosystem but

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,760
it's

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,599
a little bit too specific in its needs

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,360
and maybe has a

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,519
freemium model or something attached

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
with it and then you sort of get to

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,800
these higher level functions within a

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
project but are really really critical

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,880
ones to grow

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,480
who's managing the assets is it one

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,080
company that maybe at some point could

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,959
say you don't want to change the license

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,080
terms

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,120
or is it held in something very neutral

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,480
and when we start to see that come into

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,000
play as the question

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,000
you know projects can tend to grow

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,680
pretty well you know with a degree of

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
fragmentation if the topic is

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,040
interesting enough and if the topic is

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,120
really solving enough of a problem

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,240
but it hits that glass ceiling of

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,800
organizations

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,880
willing to continue to invest and bank

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
their business on this project

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
because they don't know where this

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
project could potentially go they don't

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,640
know where the assets of this project is

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,080
and is it a safe one to depend upon and

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,839
this is really where

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,760
a project an effort like the open

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
mainframe project comes into be

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,320
and it came out to be five years ago and

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
was launched at linuxcon seattle along

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,720
with

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,800
a number of other ibm announcements

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,640
around really bringing open source more

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,680
broadly to the mainframe

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,440
and it included a code donation from ibm

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,680
of the anomaly detection

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,360
for engine for linux logs projects which

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,240
is part of which was a part of a

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,720
ibm product called z aware it is our

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,680
first hosted project here

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,760
if we move forward into 2016 we started

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,519
a mentorship program which brought

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040
some students excitement to the

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,120
mainframe and

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,959
contributing importing various open

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,839
source tooling and contributing to open

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,839
source projects

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,480
we'll talk more about that in the future

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,600
here two years ago was the launch of zoe

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
which was

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
a revolution to the zos operating system

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
it was the first ever

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
open source project launched

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,240
specifically on z

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,079
os and has enabled the modernization of

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,480
that side of the platform

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
and when you have such a huge project

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,160
like that that gets launched

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,480
through the effects of that start to get

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,320
felt downstream and all of a sudden

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,000
we saw last year with a doubling of our

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,560
hosted projects

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,399
focusing on areas that such as zvm

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,320
other areas of devops zosmf

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
and then in 2020 we've just continued

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,079
that to grow with even a greater focus

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,120
on technologies like cobol

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,880
and education in other areas of really

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
helping expand the footprint of the

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,360
mainframe

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,760
so the open mainframe project the

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,000
mission here is building a community

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,600
and adoption of open source in the

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,399
mainframe and it's done three different

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,160
ways

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,320
eliminating the barriers to that

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
adoption demonstrating the value of the

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,959
mainframe

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,560
and what i think is really always the

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,480
most important thing for any

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,320
open source foundation is strengthening

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
those collaboration points because that

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,360
collaboration

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,760
is what drives those other two pieces

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,920
and drives that larger community

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,519
and eliminating barriers is just a

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,360
multifaceted piece

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,920
from not only becoming that central

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,640
focal point but also showcasing ways

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,440
that

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,279
engagement can happen around getting

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,680
involved in the mainframe

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,320
the value of showcasing the business and

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
technical

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,600
case studies and thought leadership and

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,399
helping champion some of those solutions

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,000
and on the collaboration points of using

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
the hosted projects which we'll talk

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,880
about in

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,760
other projects out there to build

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,760
engagement and other collaboration

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,440
and the tools and resources to make this

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,880
happen

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,639
the open mainframe project currently

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,240
hosts 16 projects

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,440
from all sorts of areas and functions of

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,639
the mainframe world

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,040
and you can learn a little bit more

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,720
about them at openmainframeproject.org

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,320
projects in addition we track a

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
larger scheme of open source in the

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,639
mainframe in general

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,959
and if you go to

00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,200
l.openmainframeproject.org

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,720
you can check out the landscape of open

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
source on the mainframe

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,519
complete from the projects that are very

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,240
specific to open source in the mainframe

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,079
along with the broad zoe conformance

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,160
ecosystem and applications that are

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,000
being driven in that space

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,440
in addition we also track broad open

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,720
source projects that are supporting the

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,160
mainframe as well

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
all these are great assets and all of

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,680
these are great ways to understand how

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,600
the impact of open source on mainframe

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,959
is

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,040
so let's talk a little bit about some of

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,800
these projects more from an

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,360
aspect of the challenges and the impacts

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,720
that we were looking to focus on so

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
let's start with zoe we talked about

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,920
that you've probably heard about zoe a

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,240
couple of times

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,839
the challenges that the zos operating

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,079
system was facing

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,720
is it wasn't a very modern system from

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,200
an integration standpoint

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,760
oftentimes many of the main interactions

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,639
is the os were using a 3278 terminal and

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,600
that was

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,680
a huge challenge not only just from a

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,519
technical aspect of integrating with

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,839
other parts of the organization

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:39,600
but also a talent aspect where

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,519
it was you know really hard to bring

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,399
modern development tools

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,279
into here and because of that newer

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,680
generations

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,320
of developers were just not looking at

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,160
zoe as a target

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,760
in 2018 as we talked about open

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,040
mainframe project added

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,560
zoe into this ecosystem here and

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,279
since then things have begun to thrive

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,959
in 2019 it reached its 1.0 release

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,199
and it launched a conformant program to

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,079
help enable that downstream ecosystem to

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,240
exist

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,399
and over time there's been continuous

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
investments on collaboration ecosystem

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,120
development

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,120
and infrastructure to help make this

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,160
project successful

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,839
as we sit today over 20 000 commits and

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,920
200 committers all time

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,320
have made an impact on the zoe project

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
and significant mind share in the devops

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,000
world

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,399
has grown of the mainframe because of

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,279
zoe of helping connect those pieces

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,079
we also are proud to see over 20 zoe

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,480
conformant

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,079
offerings in the market right now and

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,199
that's a growing number from five

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,199
different organizations

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,360
so zvm as many people may be familiar

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,839
with you're familiar with the mainframe

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
is the hypervisor that is very native to

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,160
the mainframe

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,079
and if you think of a hypervisor think

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,880
of something like kvm is is a very much

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,480
equivalent

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
zvm is very specific to this

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,120
architecture and has been a part of

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,399
architecture for decades now and because

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,079
it's been a part of that

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,760
mainframe shops have standardized on it

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,199
that's the tooling they use it's very

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,040
robust it's very

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,440
secure a lot of efforts been putting

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,600
into it but as organizations

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,279
were looking to more cloud enabled their

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
deployment strategies

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,480
zvm didn't have the right connections to

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,199
make that happen

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,800
now there were some efforts put together

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,120
to make that happen

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,720
but it just never really worked as well

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,519
and it wasn't as seamless as a customer

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,360
would like

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,720
and so ibm took it upon themselves they

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,399
said we're going to rewrite pieces of

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,279
this but they were even running into a

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,320
problem

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,160
of how to develop and grow this out more

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,759
because being an ibm only project it

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,079
really made it hard to get

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,839
broader broader collaboration in

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,320
addition you know technologies such as

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,839
openstack and others that were depending

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,519
um you know they were leveraging a

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
tooling like this into being held back

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,720
on the platform

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:56,000
in 2019 feilong became an open mainframe

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
project and feilong was the code that

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,199
came from a product

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,880
a project inside of ibm called the zvm

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,720
cloud connector

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,360
now the interesting piece here is is ibm

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,600
looking to

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
drive and getting more people involved

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,000
in this project

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,440
they strategically saw that the

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,800
co-chairs of the technical steering

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,839
committee that's the leadership of this

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
project

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,079
are actually two non-ibmers one from

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,519
suse and one from velocity software

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,880
and that really made a big signal to the

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,720
market that there really went that

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,440
there's a community approach needed

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,880
to help drive this forward and their big

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,279
focus and they've got it up and going is

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,920
an open ci and cd infrastructure

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,639
to enable more people to be able to try

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,279
this code out

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,720
use it test it and provide feedback and

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,959
as we said in 2020

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,199
we're already seeing more organizations

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,199
engaging there's a list there

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,600
the columns might come infinity ici

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,279
icuit in addition to ibm

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,639
and more innovations and integrations

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,240
are starting to happen in the community

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,839
they're finding their way upstream

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,079
making this sort of the hub of that

00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:00,399
collaboration around

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,399
zvm and cloudstech technologies

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
you might have heard some of the

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,919
challenges here in the united states in

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
the early days of the covid crisis

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,720
on the impact of many of our state and

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,919
local government

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,760
systems in the heavy response and tax on

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,640
those systems due to record unemployment

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
requests

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,000
many of those systems were driven from a

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,039
mainframe many of those systems written

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,959
in cobalt

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,559
and there was a huge challenge that was

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,319
raised of you know what can be done to

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,200
help modernize these systems

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,440
support for helping you know drive drive

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,160
for

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,840
future functionality many new systems

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,600
have been under invested in and a lot of

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,280
the challenge was pointed to of a lack

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,200
of cobalt talent

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,039
well the open mainframe community came

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,520
together and

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,039
it said well look not only do we want to

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,400
make sure the talent gap

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,400
is solved but we also want to enable

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,440
the next generation of talent to grow

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,440
from here

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,440
and there was two big areas of the

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,600
project innovated

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,840
one of to help that next generation

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,440
is it launched an open source cobalt

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,320
programming course and so this is a

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
cobol

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,840
a programming course that's fully

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,440
available as open source ibm's provides

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,640
some infrastructure for running some of

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,160
the labs if you need it

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,679
but otherwise you can take it you can

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,440
download it

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,280
we've even seen people integrated into

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
their own training materials as well for

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,679
people getting up to speed on cobalt

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,520
and this is not just cobalt based on a

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,440
green screen this is cobalt using vs

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,880
code and eclipse chain other modern

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,120
tooling

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,720
and second the project created a

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,200
collaboration forum and a

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
cobalt talent availability forum that

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,960
was helping

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,960
locate and bring all of this talent out

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,000
here that was available for volunteer

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,120
higher work to be able to showcase

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,320
their availability and within

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,120
a week of both of these being launched

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,000
which was

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,280
really about a week after this really

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,200
started to hit

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,559
um the critical mass and and all the

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
calls for many of the state and local

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,240
governments from cobalt

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,880
talent really starting to hit the media

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,320
uh

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,640
both of both of these areas here we're

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,280
already starting to see huge growth

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
to date over 1700 individuals have made

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,000
themselves

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,280
available in the congo cobalt

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,160
programmers

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,000
forum most of those made themselves

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
available within the coming weeks after

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
that announcement

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,000
and the kobo probing programming course

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,520
has over 1700 stars on github and over

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,240
300 forks and we had over a thousand

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,400
stars

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,799
by the time the code actually fully made

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,160
it up onto the github repository that's

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,080
how much excitement

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,440
has happened around that a huge

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,840
innovation of bringing that community

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
together

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,520
and thinking of that next generation we

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,280
talked to talked a little bit about the

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,960
mentorship program and again

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,480
this was one of the first things that

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,559
the project kicked off

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,840
and is with the eye of how do we

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,360
help enable that next generation because

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,919
we realize

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,200
that there's a huge amount of tenured

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,120
mainframe talent

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,039
that's at the back end of their career

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,120
and how can we enable that next

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,799
generation to get involved

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,080
and furthermore there was also a

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,600
challenge of students just not knowing

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,880
that there was opportunities

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,400
within mainframe and there was already

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
that interest in open source how could

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,559
the two be married together

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,240
2016 the first mentorship program was

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,679
launched with seven mentees

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,159
and it has connected so

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,880
many students in the broad open source

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,360
community

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
together but also making those impacts

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,320
upstream

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,159
and and additionally it's been brought

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,440
into university programs with vcu and

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,640
western university of

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,559
ontario participating to date we've seen

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,159
over 40 mentees completed the program

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,640
with broader classwork

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,360
programs reaching another 100 students

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
or more

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,360
and this upstream work has been super

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,080
impactful it's supported alpine linux to

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,080
the platform it's

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,000
included contributions to hyperledger

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,640
openstack cloud foundry kubernetes and

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,559
more

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,720
and these mentees are continuing on in

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,280
industry and they're being employed

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,159
in mainframe roles in a number of the

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,400
vendors and

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,720
clients in the space huge area if we'd

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,039
seen success

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,080
so as you can see mainframe innovation

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,480
it thrives here

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,120
and we as a project we provide that

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,080
infrastructure and we provide that space

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,520
and the staff to help support it and

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
that helps drive these natural

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,240
collaboration

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,200
opportunities and you can learn more

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,000
about how all this works on our projects

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
lifecycle page

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
it's more than just supporting open

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,760
source projects that we host

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,120
but how can we go beyond our hosted

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,960
projects

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,640
one area has been through our supported

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,840
projects program which this

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,600
has been an avenue for supporting broad

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,200
open source projects that need to

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,960
support this architecture

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
with infrastructure development support

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,159
market awareness and as needed

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,240
governance and iphone

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,000
this has been something that has been

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
ongoing well before the open mainframe

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,720
project

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
launched with back in the days of the

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,840
open source development labs and we've

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,799
carried it forward and grown this

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
program here

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,080
and you can see below some of the open

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,720
source projects that have been impacted

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
by this work

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,320
it's a keen area here as we want to make

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,400
sure that people understand

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,840
really what a mainframer is somebody

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
who's spent their career

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,039
in this space and with that we've

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,799
launched a monthly podcast

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,039
that highlights the diversity and

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,880
mainframe so not just

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,480
a singular view of who a mainframer is

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
but people from young old different

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,360
nationalities different genders

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,360
different backgrounds

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,280
and talking about why they decided to

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,840
have a career in mainframe and what they

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,640
view

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,640
the technology in korea field is like

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,720
you can check this out on any of the

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,200

interviews we had

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,480
ross mori from ibm interviewed a few

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,600
months ago

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,039
and we've had a lot of other students um

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,559
other people have been professionals in

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,159
the space people knew into their career

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,960
it's really been a great

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
um a great mix of folks and so i highly

and we've been really successful of

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,600
bringing together that larger

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,559
conversation and opportunities around

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,640
the mainframe

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,000
we just had our first annual summit back

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,039
in september

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,360

year you can look at all the recordings

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,640
for that event and check them out there

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,080
on our youtube site we have a community

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,159
forums and this is where we've drawn

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,159
a lot of conversation around cobol along

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
with zoe and many other technical topics

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,799
and you can check that out

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400

can connect directly with members of our

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,960
community as well

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,760

a vast aspect of the mainframe world

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
it's been a really huge and amazing

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,679

that is interesting an open source

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,520
