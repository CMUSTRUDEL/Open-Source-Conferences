	00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,440
today

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,240
what i'd like to talk about is

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,240
a history

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,359
a history of enterprises

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,359
with linux

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,600
next is the operating system

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,879
that started as a hobby but

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,320
now is being using many

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,840
products and

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,440
being developed by mainly

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,000
employees of companies

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:58,719
so today i will talk about

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,719
its history

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:06,799
here disclaimer

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,240
and here my experience

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,439
but it's not so important for you

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,280
so i will skip it so let me

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,280
tell about today's topics

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:26,400
there are some papers that explain

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,400
the phenomenon of that spread

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
of open source software

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
i'd like to introduce here two books

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:43,119
one is open innovation

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,880
the other is economics

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:51,360
in 1980s

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,560
superior innovations and inventions

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,000
were created famous

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,079
closed environment like

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,439
the rubber trees at the eddy

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,920
and watson design centers

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:13,520
in ibm both

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,280
turned out some nobel prize

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:22,480
winners but

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,959
this book suggested more like

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
open environments is more and more

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,040
important

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:34,480
to create innovations than

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,480
across the environment with excellent

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
examples

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:47,599
and cross-side previous wow

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,599
very expensive used to be very expensive

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,560
thoughts are owned by schools

00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:01,360
and rich families but

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,360
you can use wikipedia every day

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,760
which is created and acted

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,200
by tens of thousands of

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,840
people around the world

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,319
i put our economics into

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,319
wikipedia i found this

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:27,920
work according to

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,040
top scored economics is based on

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,959
four ideas openness parent

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,959
sharing and acting group

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,000
those keywords are all adopted by

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,000
linux community

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:51,599
this book shows the linux committees

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:54,959
as an example but in addition to linux

00:03:51,599 --> 00:04:00,080
like new medicine development

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:04,159
or even a gold mining search

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
virtual other examples

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
so

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,440
open mass collaboration created

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,000
the new world of for

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,000
innovation

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,560
the next community was born by venus

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:35,040
travolta's email to

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,639
minix working group of ethnics

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:44,400
on 25th august

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,400
1991 at that time

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,759
to learn the always

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:55,040
time about minix is the only way

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,880
to learn operating system with source

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,919
code cheaply

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,360
but he wanted

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:07,199
something more for hours

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,840
and he asked someone to

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,840
help my os development

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:20,000
in his email in a couple of

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:25,120
weeks developers gathered

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,039
increased and in 1994

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:33,520
it's published on the internet

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,520
but it's still hobby

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,360
in terms of the approach from

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,800
enterprise side following

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,759
two events what

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,759
stepping stones

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:57,520
luis rasna became the ceo of ibm

00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:02,400
from the out of ibm for the first time

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:06,080
since it's established he declared

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,360
like from now on ibm

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,560
will expand its business

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,960
based on internet

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:21,759
and openstack instead of

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:26,160
propriety locked in strategy

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:30,400
in 2000 he announced

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,800
like ibm company will spend

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:39,680
one billion dollars on linux next year

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,680
it's huge investment right

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:48,000
this message meant like from now on

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,440
ibm will seriously

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,440
deal with linux

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,039
ibm's strategy for linux

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,680
is to promote their middleware

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,680
or awesome

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,800
software business unit is one of the

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,280
most

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,720
important and valuable business units

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,759
at ibm that generated

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,120
about 30 percent of

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:30,880
net income and provided

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:34,560
the foundation of their service business

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,520
ibm respond pc business windows

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:43,199
sour venus sorry this is our venus

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,479
and some servers like

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,759
s400 or os2

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,199
who are routed by windows

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,960
besides windows around it

00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,160
they are middleware when

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,599
windows was introduced

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:08,080
customer chose sql server

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,680
instead of db2 for

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:15,840
dbms and

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,960
they adopted iis instead of

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,080
websphere for

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
application server

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:31,039
so ibm specific strategy

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,159
is they

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,039
port land deluxe on

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,080
their all servers all servers including

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,120
maintenance

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,200
and on the top of them

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,320
they run they install their middleware

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,320
with linux

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:59,519
so that ibm established fsd

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:03,200
free standard group to create

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:07,839
the standardized linux

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:12,560
api recipe

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:15,839
lsb defined standardized api

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,320
and it's complied with

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,320
by learning certification kit

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
so

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,959
it is we defined

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:36,080
standard api coordinates

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,760
i was amazed at seeing

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,560
the success of lsb at that time

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,040
there was a rumor like community

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,040
believed

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,800
innovation was more important

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,839
than compatibility but

00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,080
let's heart through the and even

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:03,360
the community supported the recipe then

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,480
ibm started cheat hopper

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,519
program chip hopping

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,920
i mean a software application

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:18,720
that compliant

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:22,320
recipe they ensure to run

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,480
it on every ibm server

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:32,320
with linux and

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:37,200
ibm started enhancement of you know

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,200
in order for max to

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,360
achieve the requirement

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:49,440
for the high-end server so that

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:54,320
they created data center

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,320
linux working group at osdr

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,839
one of the pioneer companies

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,200
in terms of promotional linux is

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,959
intel when

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:14,320
intel visited telecom

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:18,640
companies in europe to promote

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,560
their pc server namely winter coverage

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:27,200
then they are told like

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,200
we are happy with sparks rise

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:36,000
pc server is good enough

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:39,519
in terms of performance but

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,920
windows is not good enough

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:47,519
in terms of functionality for us

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,639
linuxes are much closer to the goal but

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:55,040
still some features are

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:58,320
missing then in the thought

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,680
if such a features

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,600
were updated they

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,800
adopt interserver

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,360
so they started

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,360
carrier

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:30,639
linux in

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:35,120
1996 oracle decided

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:41,120
like from now on we only support

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,120
five platforms five platforms are

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,440
smart service hp ux

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,120
ibm ax windows

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,320
deck linux so

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,480
other vendors like japanese vendors

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,680
pyramid dj they had to decide

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,600
to withdraw their own

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:09,200
uniques because customers didn't

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:14,320
buy on which they couldn't

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,320
run oracle products so

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,279
linux is that's become

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,320
became the only os that

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:31,040
they can deliver and develop the

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,040
functions that customers requested

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,959
oracle itself started investment for

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:43,199
dinner the stepped stone

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:48,880
was the tabby's benchmark

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:53,760
the only benchmarks

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:57,120
in a tpcc that

00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:02,720
complete for transaction

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,720
processing performance purpose

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,720
couldn't win against secret server

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,720
with windows

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,760
so larry ellison

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,880
ceo of oracle asked engineering

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:27,279
department isn't

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:30,800
oracle the best dvms in the world

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:34,240
is it

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,920
engineering department different

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:42,800
microsoft used the compiler

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:46,560
that had a special optimization

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:50,760
function for second server and

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,680
they use authorization path

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:59,279
authorization path

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,279
ah specific dedicated faster

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:14,959
you are saying that if

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:19,440
we don't have voice

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,079
we cannot win that benchmark

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,079
is that so

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,639
engineering department sir

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:34,160
let's tune up linux in order for rock

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:39,519
to achieve higher performance

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:43,040
than this target invention

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,839
um soon

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,079
they changed different platform from

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,399
spark source to

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,399
red hot enterprise graph

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,320
and

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,320
in 2007

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:09,839
they produced raku enterprise redux

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:09,839
from the third enterprise

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:17,680
when the companies started

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
youngster met

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,639
developers and their managers were

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:31,519
confused because

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:35,040
there are differences in terms of

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:39,519
development method between

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,519
within the companies and

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:48,560
in the community cesaro

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,600
asked community to develop

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,800
the requirement from the

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,160
district up from the

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,000
telego market but

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:06,160
communities replied

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,280
in part like you are not

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,559
holy we are not just raped

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:17,600
if you want something not

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:23,280
used develop them by yourselves

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,280
and you can continue to use small source

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,840
after that cgr dropped some functions

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,520
and provided source code for the

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,160
argument

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
functions

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,799
and community

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,400
deploy if

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,120
you want some function

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,120
in enough

00:17:51,679 --> 00:18:00,160
you have to discuss with maintenance

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,360
at the community and work together

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:07,200
develop further in a community

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,280
according to the community way and

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,320
they receive some critical comments

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:28,240
right

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:31,280
your proposed not available

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,679
so it's not so appropriate for general

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,679
purpose

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,679
their requirement

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:50,240
and it almost at all

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,240
eventually called montavista

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,120
invested by intel started

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,640
to develop seizure functions in

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,559
ordinarks

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,559
that was forked from the upstream

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,240
so montevista

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,400
ibm started

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:34,000
porting linux on their own servers

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
including mainframe

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,840
according to their strategy

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:49,360
but but at that time

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,960
my friend had

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,400
more than 10 much processors

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,840
and last

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,840
enhancement features

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,960
linux is still inadequate for mainframe

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,520
so i will recommend it

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:14,000
learning relax on wheel button machine

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,000
zebra

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,440
and they started by

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,480
for mulch processors or hardware us

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:34,159
in order to learn

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,640
application software effectively on a

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,559
large

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,919
processor we need a

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:45,600
right weight process

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:50,480
thread that can share

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,480
memory in that process but

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:57,679
there is a problem because

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,360
other threats may rewrite the contents

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,600
of memory

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:08,320
without permission

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,320
especially like library

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,400
is not written just for the

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,400
conventional

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,840
process so

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:27,679
in order for libraries to be

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,799
made threat sales

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,919
we have to provide

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,600
mutex control functions

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:40,720
for libraries it took

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,400
long time to be discussed

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:48,400
and to be considered between ibm

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,520
engineers and community engineers

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,559
because there are two ways

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:58,559
ibm implementation and

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:03,520
community implementation finally

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,520
community implementation was accepted

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,679
the earning a hardware loss enhancement

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:18,640
we need a layer that separates

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,000
logical one and physical one

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,280
like butter memory and

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,840
gear memory or

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
rotary

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,640
we have to provide logical manager

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:54,480
logical volume manager like

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:56,799
later implementation you know radar

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,799
through

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:05,760
ibm discuss

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:09,600
developed such function internally

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:13,039
at ibm and they provided

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,080
large source code to the community

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:19,679
but the community first

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,960
refused it because it's

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:26,000
too large to be reviewed or

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,000
to be discussed

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,520
ibm banned internal communication

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,120
so engineer had to have a communication

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:40,000
just with

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:44,559
the community and

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,840
they disturb it from a small chunk of

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,960
source underground really

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:56,400
including finally

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,400
community adopted logical volume managed

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,080
like yeah developers

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:10,559
and they are managers

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,760
other a lot of programs again

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:17,200
because of difference between

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,840
their deployment method and

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,840
committee one

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:39,440
we adopted voter 4 model

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,440
like functional specifications

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,760
are defined and according to the

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,760
testoplan

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:58,400
was compiled and

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,400
test result report is compared

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,600
and quality

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:10,240
is evaluated and

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:15,279
concerned then development completes

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,279
right it's like uh defined in

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,400
iso 9000 internal standard

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:28,159
but we have

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:33,520
no choice but to adopt

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,520
the community way at community

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,640
so even i had a

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:47,679
severe problems like

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,960
salespeople my boss

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,120
asked me like show me the roadmap of

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,600
linux

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,159
show me the functional specifications

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,520
that

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:03,440
are promised to deliver to the

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:08,559
application development of chin

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,559
but as you know

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,840
again

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:19,120
if we want to have some

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,240
functions in linux

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,919
we have not just about to

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:29,760
work with them together

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:33,120
so often

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,120
we couldn't persuade

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,320
community way to the upper managers or

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,919
sales people

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,960
then many

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:53,200
folks about who are created

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:56,720
especially in our mbta

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,720
so important things

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:04,559
is the community

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:08,320
team members are not

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,919
made up of only particular

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,960
companies employees therefore

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,240
their manager cannot manage

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,240
their development

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:27,120
without having a win-win relationship

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:32,000
and to collaborate with them

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,000
we cannot go hua

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,080
right

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,360
so to do so

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,960
i'd like to introduce two examples

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,960
that i experienced

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,520
we created 2006

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,880
with ibm engineers like

00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:01,279
start to contribute with small patches

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:05,200
rather than big chunk of source code

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,000
and i don't demand contradiction by

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,039
saying

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,120
it is already solaris and other major

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,240
vendors

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,240
that's really

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,960
linux distribution

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,320
but without iso support

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:46,320
because they

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,320
couldn't catch up with the upstream

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,440
and even now it

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,559
caused some incompatibility

00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,200
with absolute

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:06,159
redhead should continue

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,159
or continue to develop

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:14,720
under or based on upstream

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,720
fast policy

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,840
i'd like to introduce some activity in

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,039
japan

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,039
as you can see

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:34,320
there is a huge pacific ocean

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,320
between united states and japan

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,279
so there are there were

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:47,200
many barriers like

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,070
distance time difference

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,679
and languages so

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:56,000
[Music]

00:29:51,679 --> 00:30:00,559
engineers complains or dissatisfactions

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,559
or part of that like

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,640
we couldn't have any responses

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:15,360
no matter how many emails i

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,360
sent to connect mailing list

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,240
so we

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,760
set up the meeting between now

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:31,840
japanese vendors and

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,840
next main mentors

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:41,120
to discuss a couple of issues like

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:45,440
drivers issues resource managers

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,440
and dust features

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:54,159
when we discuss the topics in japan

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,159
like something like

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,480
if they provide

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:07,120
drivers api like

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:10,399
ddi driver device driver interpreter

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:15,360
for service or

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:19,440
vki for windows we don't need

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:23,679
to provide sources

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:28,080
in japan linux is a still minor rules

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:31,360
but very requested

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,840
you have to deed source

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,919
you develop drivers and

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:43,840
you have to provide software

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:47,279
not we

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,360
are pulling drivers

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:57,600
from the swords or windows

00:31:51,360 --> 00:32:01,200
if they continue such a outside request

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,559
knocks never becomes

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,559
major hours in japan

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:13,039
please tell them to

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:17,120
provide drivers

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,120
compatible api resource

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:25,600
of course i couldn't

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,600
say that so directly just i said

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:34,559
if you provide drivers api

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:38,399
according to them we can develop

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:42,559
drivers and we

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:46,480
don't need to provide software

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:49,679
before the presentation

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,120
was over mr greg

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:57,120
kh interrupted that oh

00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:01,039
if you don't want to provide source code

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,880
you can learn your driver in utero

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:07,600
if it's gone we share

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,799
one's source code within the community

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,159
so that

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,480
we can develop together maintenance

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,240
together

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:22,240
collaborate with each other

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,559
it's a basic principle of the deluxe

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,320
corner community

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,640
major drivers are doing

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,640
so

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,360
and

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,760
if it's coming

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,799
if you encounter the problem

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,240
everyone can support you

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:54,640
help you collaborate

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:59,120
with you it's incredible

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,120
we can't investigate

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,919
anything or

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:11,520
it's not so difficult to develop

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,359
drivers in linux

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,480
having to let ma e

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,679
white paper that describes

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,240
as how to write drivers in

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:29,359
general probably oh

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,359
you haven't ready

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,919
i already messed up

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:43,200
this period disappointing

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:46,800
and i thought i couldn't have

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,800
a certain meeting anymore

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:54,560
but agenda meeting

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,839
mr andrew morton gave a hand to

00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,280
rescue me like

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,560
certainty there are some excellent

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,839
engineers in japan and we know

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,119
often they lack

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,119
communication with us

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:19,359
so let

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,839
us go to japan a few times

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,839
a year

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,200
so

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,920
started

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,760
it's a very successful effective event

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
at that time the head of voice there mr

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,000
knight

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:48,079
he did excellent job

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,839
he requested every communication

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:54,480
should be done in english even between

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,480
japanese

00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:02,400
and he said after

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:07,599
long breaks between our sessions

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:11,920
we call it coffee breaks or coffee times

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,720
and the end of the meeting there are

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,000
party

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,000
with simple catering students

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:25,280
japanese engineers took advantage of

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,280
that opportunity

00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,170
[Music]

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,160
we experienced a lot

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:54,480
positive thing in

00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:57,520
2006 mr bottle from

00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,680
he attended the khan summit

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,680
as a first japanese from japan

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,200
and participants

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:12,800
from the korea and china increased

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,800
in 2009

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,000
canada summit was held in japan it's our

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,000
only corner summit

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:27,440
that was held

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,640
outside of north america

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,760
and europe still

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:38,079
then dj found

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:43,280
from prediction attended

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,280
the first chinese from mainland china

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,160
actually

00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,610
[Music]

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:05,760
a lot of opportunity to

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,760
improve communication

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,760
educate engineers

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:23,920
finally the contribution from japan

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:27,040
increased up to about

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:32,560
10 percent of economy

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:36,640
purchase 10 percent of current patches

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,640
and long breaks

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,240
had been taken over by the linux

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,520
foundation

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:49,040
the knox foundation played

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,280
role to improve

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,880
the communication you know linux

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,320
exchange

00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:02,560
they started collaboration summit

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,560
or in the user meeting

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,320
so

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:17,760
probably in a 2.6 10 to 2.620

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,760
some major functions

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:25,200
what i installed like native projects

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:29,280
like library asynchronous io

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:32,480
64-bit addressing and so on

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:38,079
then like it's a time for

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,079
crossing card customers

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:49,040
alternative now

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:53,839
as you know linux is everywhere

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,839
as a standard os in a mobile phone

00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
computer

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:06,319
and more than 85 percent of

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,079
developers are employees

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:13,440
of enterprises or companies

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:19,599
and they developed

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,599
redux during their working time

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,119
all right actually

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,960
in addition to the technical issues we

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,560
encountered

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,359
a lot of legal issues but today i will

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,800
skip

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:43,119
them because of time constraints

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,400
so let me enter

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,400
the today's main subject

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:53,520
as it said open source software

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,800
is eating the word and

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,200
in the future even in future like aig

00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,200
5g

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,640
everywhere

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,160
that's using a tvs

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,160
commodores

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:18,160
lice cooking machines washing machine

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,160
you name it

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,839
but

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:30,720
even like you have to deal with oss

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,319
you don't have enough time

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,440
and resources to learn

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:41,119
from mistakes

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,319
failures that have

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:48,640
been done by saba vendors

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:50,880
including me in 2000

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,880
so

00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:02,560
here very nice document from

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:06,960
linux foundations

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,960
open source guides for the enterprise

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,520
there are some documents here what kind

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,800
of organization

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:21,280
you should have in our companies

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:24,720
or what tools they are

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,920
to deal with open source or

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:33,280
how to evaluate

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,280
open source success or this wise

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:41,680
how to join the community or

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,800
how to attend community but it shows

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,160
from small chunk of code or

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:52,640
long breaks at events

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:58,480
already as i mentioned there are

00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:01,520
many best practices

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:06,319
strongly i recommend you to read

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,319
this if you want to join community

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:16,640
i didn't explain the

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,640
problem of bigger issues but

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,640
today open source

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:31,440
is used in uh like parts

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:36,400
like navigator

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,400
or in vehicle camera in cars

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,520
so now

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,440
it's very important to manage

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:51,520
the oss governance

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,800
in an entire supply chain

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:59,119
including path

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,119
please imagine this

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,480
your friend

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:12,079
decided not to use all the camcorder and

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:16,400
gave it to you at 200

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,400
without user guide without

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:26,400
also you wanted new one

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:31,280
and gave it to another friend

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,280
stranger pieces to you like

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,440
you violated the gpa

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,599
therefore you are

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,400
bound from using gpu

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,400
because

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:57,839
user card contains the location of

00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:01,920
linux this computer equipped

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:05,920
with linux and

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,520
describes the fact that

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:14,160
it's delivered under

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:18,560
gpo license without

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:22,720
both information

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,720
gpl prohibited

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,440
disposition of licensed

00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,440
software

00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:38,319
oh you will be upset

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:42,480
right what does it mean by

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,480
burning from using gpo

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,920
i can't use the internet

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,920
i cannot get on a train worker

00:45:52,480 --> 00:46:01,359
oh if you

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:06,560
gave me two hundred dollars

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,560
i will tell nobody

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,560
but it happened

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,760
in europe someone called

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:21,520
license troll and

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:26,560
a few million dollars by this way

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,560
in europe so

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,960
again

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:36,160
oss is everywhere so

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,359
you have to manage

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:43,839
oss governance through

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,839
entire supply chain

00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,440
okay that's it for today

00:46:51,680 --> 00:47:00,079
i wanted

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,720
you to know the information

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,720
