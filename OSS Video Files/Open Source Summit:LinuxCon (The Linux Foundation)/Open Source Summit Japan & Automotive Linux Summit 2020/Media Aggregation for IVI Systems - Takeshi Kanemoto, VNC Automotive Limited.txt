and i'm here to talk to you about media

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,920
aggregation for

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,920
ibi systems

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
here is the agenda for this talk i'm

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
going to start with a short

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,359
introduction of the company i work for

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,359
vnc automotive

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,760
then i'm going to show you some current

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,120
trends in content consumption

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,000
how people are consuming media next i'll

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,160
move on to

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in-car entertainment of the future what

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,840
the automotive passengers

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,200
of the future would want from in-car

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,879
entertainment

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
and then the state of in-car

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,440
connectivity where

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,879
where we are today in terms of in-car

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,039
entertainment

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,719
and finally i'm going to finish the talk

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,199
with some of the challenges

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,160
facing the automotive industry in trying

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,359
to achieve

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,559
that vision of the future

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,559
so introduction

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:15,360
we are bnc automotive we started in 2019

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,479
as a division of real bnc

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,479
that's the inventor of the bnc protocol

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,520
since 2018 we have been an independent

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,080
company providing the automotive

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,960
industry

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,439
with connectivity software our products

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,079
include

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,520
device connectivity remote control

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,320
software

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,520
multimedia framework and telematics

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,520
software

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
and i would like to share with you today

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,240
our insight based on

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,880
our experience in helping automakers

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,880
realize in-car entertainment solutions

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,200
so let me show you some trends in

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,200
constant content consumption

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,040
these are mostly figures that apply to

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,719
the general public

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,200
not limited to the automotive industry

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,080
so it's not surprising that media

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,520
consumption

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,000
is on the rise on the graph on the left

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,640
you can see how media consumption has

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
shifted

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,879
over the last hundred years in the us as

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
an example

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,480
as people started to have more leisure

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,599
time they spent more time

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,400
on consuming media content you can see

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,000
that analog

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,440
tv was starting to dominate in the 70s

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,879
1980s only to be replaced by digital

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
media such as

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:43,440
digital tv streaming services and games

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
on the right you'll see a trend of where

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
the

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
where the digital media content is

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,480
consumed

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,120
showing the number of hours u.s adults

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,599
have spent with digital media you can

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,760
see that

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,159
back in the back in 2008 very few people

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,000
were consuming digital media on their

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,519
smartphones

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,480
and as more um and

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,680
personal computers dominated with the

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,440
arrival of

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,640
smartphones and as more mobile-centric

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,080
web technologies became prevalent uh we

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,360
started to see mobile

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,319
consumption overtaking pc consumption

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,760
around 2013

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,680
and in 2008 the mobile phone

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,720
takes up majority of the media

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,640
consumption space

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,840
so media consumption has been and

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,519
continues to be

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,200
increasing and it's increasingly digital

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,200
and it's increasingly mobile

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,640
and it wouldn't be 2020 without talking

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,480
about covert 19.

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
with the lock down and stay at home

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,480
measures the upward trend

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,599
in media consumption is being

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,000
accelerated

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,640
as people need to fill the time they

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
would have

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,319
otherwise spent outdoors on

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,560
their on other other activities

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,280
the infographic on the right taken from

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
the bbc

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
is showing the figures that represent

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,079
the viewing

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,040
habits of adults in the uk during the

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,400
first

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,440
lockdown so let's have a look

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,320
adult spent six and a half

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
hours a day watching tv and online video

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,800
that's 45

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,160
hours a week out of those six and a half

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
hours

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,759
they spent over an hour watching

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,840
streaming services

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,960
double what it was before the pandemic

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,360
and 12 million customers signed up to

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
new

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,600
services like netflix amazon prime and

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,919
disney plus

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
and viewing figures for video streaming

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:01,440
services

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,440
have gone up by 71 compared to 2019

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
so these are some big shifts in people's

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,759
behavior and

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,360
even though they might be temporary

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,400
undoubtedly some of

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,360
them will have a long-term impact on

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,360
people's lives

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,199
here is another trend more people are

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,520
using

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,520
screens to consume content and more

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,360
people are using multiple screens to

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,759
complete a daily task

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
in fact ninety percent of all media

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,919
interactions are happening

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,039
on screens more than seventy percent of

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,520
digital users

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,120
access the internet across multiple

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,400
devices

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,479
and 90 of these users uh use

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,080
multiple screens sequentially to

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,759
accomplish a task

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,199
you can imagine a consumer starting

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,720
their online

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,680
purchasing on their mobile device

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
browsing for pho options uh perhaps on

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
the train

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
but switching to their laptop once they

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,440
get home

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,880
and finally completing the purchase on

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,000
their biggest screen

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,919
that they have on their laptop

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
consumers are getting consumers are

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,280
getting more used to having access to

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,919
the same content

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,520
from multiple devices expecting the

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,280
content to be responsive

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,000
to the nature of the device that they're

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,560
using choosing which device to access

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,120
that content based on the experience

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
they want

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
another trend is the number of

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,800
subscription services

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,400
and how they are becoming increasingly

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,960
fragmented

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,440
and more exclusive content is being

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
offered

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,039
by services in trying to attract more

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
users

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,520
and this is leading to more

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,840
subscriptions per user

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,120
consumers often need to sign up to

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,160
multiple services

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,560
to watch their favorite shows

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,319
almost all subscription services offer

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,520
their own application

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,560
to the best uh for the best experience

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,639
and the the other interfaces are often

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,440
siloed as well

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,840
so you end up with different apps on and

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,160
interfaces on any given device

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,120
that you have to switch between when

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,599
consuming content

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
and can this trend really carry on i

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,360
think we are starting to see

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,360
people getting the so-called

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,599
subscription fatigue

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
some studies suggest that we are already

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,720
seeing the start of a downward trend

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,960
in the number of subscriptions per user

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,360
in some regions

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,440
we can predict that there is a great

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,319
value there is great value in having

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,280
services that offer usable aggregation

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,360
of content

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,360
from multiple content sources

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,360
just to go back to kobit 19 again

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,440
covet 19 is having an enormous impact on

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,919
people's mobility

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,199
there is a clear shift away from that

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,400
means of transport

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,280
such as airplanes and trains as people

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,360
prefer

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,919
private vehicles for intercity travel

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,960
a third of customers value having

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,759
constant access to private vehicles

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,080
more than before kovite 19 this

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,800
percentage is higher amongst younger

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,800
consumers

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,520
but how is that impacting media

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,080
consumption in those private vehicles

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
well sources suggest that people are

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,200
still bringing their

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,360
own devices into cars the current gen

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,320
native infotainment systems are not

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,279
quite there yet

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
in terms of streaming user generated and

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,600
social content

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,320
technologies such as carplay and android

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
auto

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,200
are bridging the gap between the user's

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,600
devices and the ibi systems

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,480
but they are overwhelmingly

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
driver-centric

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,000
we are seeing some trends in automotive

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,240
demos automotive demos that give us an

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,920
indication as to where the industry is

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
headed

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,440
one of the things that we see in the

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,160
horizon is

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,440
autonomous driving once autonomous

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,480
driving technology

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,399
reaches level three four and five

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,519
we'll start to see the driver having

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,959
more time

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,000
for other activities and to look even

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,120
further

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,680
mobility as a service will

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,640
see a shift away from the idea of

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,760
private car

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,880
ownership and more towards

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,680
cars being more of a commodity this will

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,120
free up time for other activities whilst

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:52,720
on the move and in fact some

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:57,040
suggest that this passenger economy

00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,080
will free up more more than 250 million

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,480
hours of commuting time per year in some

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,839
of the most congested cities

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,360
in the world and the rising consumer use

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,800
of in-vehicle applications and content

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,079
will add up to a total addressable

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,279
market value of

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,079
200 billion dollars so that's a huge

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,880
market

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,880
to tap into

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,240
so with all these trends in mind

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,560
what does in-car entertainment look like

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,600
in the future

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,200
well here are some examples

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,720
so imagine this scenario you summon

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,880
an autonomous car uh with

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,959
your mobile phone and the vehicle pulls

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,000
up recognizes your phone

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,560
it unlocks a door and welcomes you with

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,279
a

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,000
message projected on the window you

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,839
climb in

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,680
and a digital assistant verifies your

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,680
destination and shows you

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,320
the route and the time needed to get

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,720
there and off you go

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,519
once you're moving the fun begins the

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,200
screen rises the projectors extend

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:12,399
the image the image to the side windows

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,200
for a 180 degree experience

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,560
you can sit in the third row and enjoy

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
interactive media on

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,440
route to your destination on the

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,120
available windows

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,240
such example is already being

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,240
demonstrated by intel and bmw

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
and there are other similar demos

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,440
involving virtual reality

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,440
and augmented reality for instance

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,160
but it's not all just for fun people can

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,120
start to use the car as their mobile

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,279
office with large high resolution touch

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,760
screens with data connections they can

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,639
have

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,279
a better working environment than simply

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,760
working on their laptops

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,959
even without sophisticated computing

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,880
units in the car

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,959
simply mirroring laptops onto screens

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,000
inside the car can provide a more

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,240
comfortable working environment

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
with more reliable data connections in

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
the car

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
use cases such as video conferencing

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,360
will become

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,240
commonplace this may seem far in the

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
future but

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,680
the basic building blocks of these

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,680
examples are already here today

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,959
but for these examples to be truly

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,320
accepted by the users and not just some

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,120
gimmick

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,040
there is an important component that

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,399
technology has to overcome

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,079
and that is usability

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,240
and to achieve that here are some

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,600
important technological problems that

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,800
need to be resolved

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,800
or need to be solved

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,639
first of all content aggregation so

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,600
sharing

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,200
and aggregating content libraries is key

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,399
to making the experience

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
usable flexible playback that means

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,600
playing any content from

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,160
any device and service on any other

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
screen

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,720
in the car seamless media experience so

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,160
shifting between screens within and

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,120
without the car

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,920
for a better integration with the users

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,920
daily lives

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,760
so content aggregation

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,760
aggregated and shared content libraries

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,959
should become the norm

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,760
we should be able to see and play

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,240
music from all registered devices in the

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,079
car

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,079
over wi-fi rather than the

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,560
point-to-point link provided by

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,160
current industry standards like

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,720
bluetooth android auto

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,079
carplay etc

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,920
users should be able to share

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,600
pre-downloaded videos with other

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,240
passengers

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
and this will be a blessing for parents

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,399
who will be able to use their smartphone

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,279
to start a cartoon for a

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,240
child in the rear seat without having to

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,240
reach around

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,480
and try to press buttons on a screen

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,720
they can't see properly

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,320
consumers should be able to well they

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,160
should expect to be able to start

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,600
playback from

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,720
any device or screen on any other device

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,279
in the vehicle

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,920
so that's flexible playback playback

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,760
sources

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,199
should include things like online

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,320
streaming platforms

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,199
oem provisioned content local media like

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,040
usb storage and optical disks

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:34,160
and devices and devices on the wi-fi

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,320
playback should include um

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,320
bring your own devices like smartphones

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
and tablets

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
rear seat entertainment units and even

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
the main

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,639
in vehicle infotainment console which

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,959
are all

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,079
subject to legal restrictions like

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,079
viewing in motion

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,199
see seamlessly shifting the media

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,760
experience from one device

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,240
or screen to another within the car will

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,639
become

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
commonplace for example a consumer

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,399
should expect to be able to

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,680
continue playing the same content on

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,240
their mobile device

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,079
as they enter the vehicle on the screens

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,800
inside

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,920
so to provide this capability a flexible

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,120
software solution

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,320
is needed so that the service can be

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,199
varied by manufacturers and based on the

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
vehicle model

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,680
and the target demographic and this

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,880
should be complemented by

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,920
a content catalog

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,680
so that's the future

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:41,040
but let's take a look at what the

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:44,000
current state of in-car connectivity

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,600
the so-called connected car has evolved

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,040
over the years

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,079
and we saw some interesting ideas in

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,360
as early as the 1960s but it wasn't

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,440
until the entertainment boom around

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,519
2007 that we saw connected

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,279
connectivity solutions like mirrorlink

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,680
arrive on the scene

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,639
from there we saw companies like google

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,839
and apple

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,000
enter the market with android auto and

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,759
carplay

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
and we are seeing the ongoing

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,199
development of v2x and mobility

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,720
technologies

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,959
today in these following pictures

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,199
you can really see how the cockpit of a

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,920
car has evolved over the years

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,920
with the evolution of the connected car

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:37,839
so let's focus on the connectivity

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
solutions for the cockpit

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,519
smartphone connectivity is an important

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
part of that

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,680
as mobile devices have their own rich

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,639
application ecosystems

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,000
that the automaker can leverage and the

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,519
mobile devices often

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,519
come with data connectivity

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,839
in terms of smartphone connectivity

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,759
standards out there

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,519
there are quite a few and you can see

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
some of them here

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,199
on the left you have the more mobile

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,199
centric ones like

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,799
apple carplay android auto and baidu car

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,919
life these are driven by

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,640
web and mobile technology companies in

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,959
the middle

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,360
you have the more community driven

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,240
standards like smart device link

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,120
and mirrorlink and on the right you have

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,600
the

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
the more oem centric proprietary

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,799
solutions the market is fairly

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,440
fragmented

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,200
and there's no clear winner but all of

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,200
them have a couple of things in common

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,120
they are often point to point designed

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,520
for one

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,520
phone and one display not really

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,840
designed for having multiple devices

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,840
connected

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,160
or driving multiple displays

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,120
using different content from the same

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,280
phone

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,280
or at least having multiple devices

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,280
really adds any extra value

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:06,160
and they are also driver centric

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,080
there's more focus on adding um avoiding

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,039
driver distraction

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,840
with simplified ui and big buttons and

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,840
the ui

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,000
is often limited in what you can access

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
this means almost all of them are

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,520
ill-fitted

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
as connectivity standards or media

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,840
consumption

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:31,840
for other passengers

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,520
apart from the projection based

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,520
smartphone connectivity

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,360
we have some more traditional means of

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,840
media playback

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,360
we have optical disks and usb

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,200
storage these are simple but effective

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,720
and these days considered somewhat

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,520
cumbersome because

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,280
the user has to carry or store physical

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,880
disks and drives

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,640
and they would much rather carry their

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,039
media around on their phones or even

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,559
stream content from online services

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,440
it's much easier then you have the

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,640
good old bluetooth with protocols like a

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,160
to dp

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,160
you can have a good multi-source

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,919
experience with that but there's no

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,200
video capability and of course tv

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:25,840
is quite important in parts of the world

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,840
um in some parts of the world like japan

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,280
so we focused on the cockpit until now

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,559
but what are what about rear seat

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,559
entertainment

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,120
rear seat entertainment has been around

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,919
for years but adoption has been

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,880
slow it's largely provided by

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,320
aftermarket

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,640
equipment suppliers with high price tags

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,039
the resolution is often low and

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:56,720
functionality is often limited

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,640
but cars are getting bigger and the

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,480
interest in rear seat entertainment

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,080
systems is strong across

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,280
all regions demand is mainly from

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,240
the younger users and but so far the

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,640
lack of high

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,960
bandwidth data connection inside cars

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,159
has been one of the major barriers to

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,559
bsc entertainment being more popular

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,480
but with the introduction of low-cost

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,120
unlimited 5g

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,240
data plans in the near future we can

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,960
predict that

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,120
the demand for vsc entertainment will go

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,120
up

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,400
there are some other interesting

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,960
technologies around

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,080
for in-car entertainment such as

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,880
personal

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,880
audio zones

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,880
the use of in-car speaker arrays

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,720
allows each passenger to be able to

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,919
listen to their own content without

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,520
interference

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,360
and this vastly increases the

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,320
possibilities for

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,200
in-car and media consumption the example

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,320
shown here

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,919
is from harman using directional

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,360
speakers combined with noise

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,280
cancellation

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,600
and there are other similar technologies

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,600
around

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,520
and finally what are some of the

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
challenges facing the automotive

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
industry

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,000
in trying to achieve in-car

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,000
entertainment of the future

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,960
that is truly usable

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,559
so one of the key aspects is content

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,640
provisioning

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
and an important question for the

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,200
manufacturers

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,120
is compete or aggregate

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,559
how much should they compete with the

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,480
likes of netflix

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,320
amazon etc and provide their own content

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,080
or should they simply aggregate these

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,039
services to present

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,080
to the end user should they choose to

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,520
aggregate

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,559
they would be responsible for the

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,240
management of these content sources

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,840
they would need to guarantee content

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,480
delivery to all screens

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,720
inside the car both built in and brought

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
in

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,559
as manufacturers look to offer more

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,640
content options though they

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,600
will need to create commercial

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,360
frameworks

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,400
with games publishers hollywood studios

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,480
publishing houses to name only a few

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,880
plus their content protection rules

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,679
and requirements for rights management

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,960
that are

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,840
new to most manufacturers these rules

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,840
vary for

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:40,320
each piece of content destination device

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:43,200
region and delivery method

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,320
manufacturers will also need to manage

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,000
content across

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,640
borders within the eu for example

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,159
this means complying with the eu content

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,440
portability rules

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,159
which allow services to offer the same

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,120
content

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,000
catalog in many countries but moving

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,960
this content

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,919
out of the eu may incur geographical

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,919
restrictions

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,120
or additional content costs so managing

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,240
content provisioning

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,120
is hard and

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,320
there are also technological hurdles to

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,159
consider

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,480
one of the main technological hurdles is

00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,679
interoperability

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,240
when implementing media aggregation in a

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,640
car

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,400
there's a multitude of operation

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,720
operating systems

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,200
software and hardware platforms

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,360
protocols and schemas

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
the aggregation solution needs to work

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,039
across these

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,640
all of these combinations and this

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,240
requires a flexible

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,240
and modern software stack

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,000
so we've had some protocols in the past

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,039
that

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,640
partially fulfill these requirements

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:58,640
of media aggregation inside vehicles

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,520
one such example is dlna

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
it's okay but it also has a lot of

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,039
limitations

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,080
it lacks support for modern formats like

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,640
mkv

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:13,919
etc plus its predefined profiles

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,600
restrict what can be can actually be

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,240
discovered and listed

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,799
some implementations work around this by

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,039
adding

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:27,120
extra on-the-fly transcoding

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,320
but it's often clunky and inefficient

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,000
most important of all the protocol

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,159
including the content protection

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,760
extensions must involve

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:42,640
files and it cannot stream screens

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:45,039
like the modern casting technologies can

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,320
technologies such as airplay 2 google

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,120
cast miracast

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,159
vnc etc it suffices to say it's not

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,279
really suited

00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:00,080
to the era of online video services

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:01,919
media streaming and photo sharing so

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,799
there's a real opportunity for a

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,679
standard

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,720
for aggregation a new standard for

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,520
aggregation

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,880
one that works across applications and

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,080
services on mobile

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,679
devices online services and

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,799
other forms of media perhaps one that

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,960
can agnostically leverage existing

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,400
casting technologies that are

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,120
point-to-point

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,080
with no aggregation but with solid

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,200
content production

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,200
mechanisms already built in they will be

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
useful for content delivery to the

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,600
playback devices

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,960
once the aggregation is done

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,080
so this is where i will finish

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,039
my talk and just to summarize

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,600
content consumption is on the rise it's

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,679
more

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,919
digital and more mobile than ever

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,200
passengers of the future will expect

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,919
usability

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,400
not just some gimmick content

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,320
provisioning is hard

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,240
and media aggregation requires a

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,279
flexible software stack

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,240
and there's an opportunity for a new

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,679
standard

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:21,679
in media aggregation

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:21,679
