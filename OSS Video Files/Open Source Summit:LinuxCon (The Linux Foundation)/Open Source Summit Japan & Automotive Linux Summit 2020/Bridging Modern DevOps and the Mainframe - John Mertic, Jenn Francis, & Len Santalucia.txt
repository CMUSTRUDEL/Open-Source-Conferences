00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,840
hi john it's great to be here it's great

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,159
to see everybody today

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,640
great well let's just jump right into it

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,720
and uh our first question really centers

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,200
around the open mainframe project and

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,760
the

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,680
zoe initiative is a part of it and the

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,479
open mainframe project turned five years

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,119
old this year

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,880
zoe turned two and we'll take a

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,080
literally look at the challenges and

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
opportunities that

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,640
led to the creation of the linux

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,479
foundation's open mainframe project and

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
zoe initiative and glenn i want to start

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,680
with you since you

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,960
uh were there at the very beginning and

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
maybe talk about

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,439
what that looked like yes i remember it

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,119
well

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,280
and it was a very exciting event

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
to be honest with everybody you know

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
five years ago

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,799
when the inception of the open mainframe

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,560
project

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,600
occurred that was also when ibm

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,200
made the announcement for the ibm

00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,320
linux 1 system which was

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,399
the linux only mainframe it has all the

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,840
characteristics and qualities of service

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,479
that

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
the ibm z mainframe has but it's all

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,959
dedicated to just

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,480
linux and open source so

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,520
it really was an exciting event and

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,720
since that time boy there has been

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
a lot of things that have occurred with

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
this

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,440
organization in and around ibm's linux

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
one

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,879
and open source on the mainframe and

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
open source

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,480
on on the linux one system so

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,959
very very exciting uh things have

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,599
occurred and then of course you know

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,920
zoe and many other i think john we're

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,280
now up to about what 15

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,640
or so projects yeah 16 projects um

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
at probably the time you hear this

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,360
recording some great progress certainly

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,800
yeah very good jen what do you think

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,840
oh wow so the open mainframe project i

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
think the first time i

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
ever became aware of it was actually

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,040
through you lynn um years ago

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,800
and we had a an intern

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
that was working on a blockchain project

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
and i remember watching them present out

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
at share which is a user group

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
conference

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,640
for the mainframe platform and at the

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
time

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,400
that was really what i knew about open

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,599
mainframe project through the linux

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
foundation

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,959
and it wasn't long after that that along

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,400
came zoe which

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,000
really became the first kind of um

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,799
collaborative uh let's say technology

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
that we could all

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,040
use that it was not just a single

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,040
company organization creating it

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
it was actually a group collaboration

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,440
and it was actually great because

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,720
the mainframe the platform itself has

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,920
always had a huge sense of community

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,200
everybody wants to get together

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,239
understand what the others are doing

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
where they're struggling what they've

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,040
learned things like that

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,400
and the linux foundation through the

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,599
open mainframe project has actually

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,599
enabled that to happen

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,439
through developing um technology through

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,560
developing educational resources

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,319
they're actually sharing all these

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
things that have kind of been you had to

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,400
know where to find the right groups and

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,159
the different

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
geos and different things like that and

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,959
now it's actually this uh formal

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,720
community

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,239
and it brought everybody together and

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,879
zoe's just been the

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,040
first big real project that everybody's

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,639
joined in on

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,239
and it's been interesting it's the

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,720
mainframe communities almost came full

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,079
circle

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,840
because if we look at back we're open

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,840
source the roots of it

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,960
it's from the mainframe community in the

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,360
50s at share

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,040
and that early collaboration and now

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,320
we've came back full circle of bringing

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
this community which is exactly like you

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,440
said jen has

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,639
always been a collaborative always been

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,600
there for one another

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560
always had that great strength and now

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,639
has came together

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,840
right under the same banner here under

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
the open mainframe project

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,639
absolutely awesome well let's skip ahead

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
next question on the panel here and

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,960
we're going to dig a little bit into zoe

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
and jen

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,840
you remarked here zoe's that real

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,759
not only that first open source project

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,919
on the zos platform

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
but really this first time where it

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,360
really clicked as this

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
i was reading what you're saying is an

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,120
aha moment

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
like oh well this isn't just a community

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,440
you know vendor giving this project

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
it's three vendors coming together

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
collaborating

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,840
on a huge technology and that

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,240
integration platform for really where z

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
os

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
is going and bringing in so many new

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,800
stakeholders but at the same time

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
also enabling the platform for decades

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,680
to come

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,960
um what are you trying to talk about and

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,880
talk about just you know as

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,160
this came into your purview like what

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
was the reactions

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,199
what have you been hearing tell me a

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
little bit more so

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,880
zoe's been really fun to watch over the

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,240
last two years so

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
when they had the big announcement i

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,120
remember being like out at sharon out at

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,880
other conferences and

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,479
the huge buzz around it everybody's like

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,000
what is this what is this

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,600
and my first takeaway and i think

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,039
everybody's first takeaway was

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,479
oh this would be great for development

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,120
everybody was talking about you know the

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,479
cli

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,120
or the fact that you could have a plug

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,720
into vs code and that's great and you

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
can do cool things on it and it allows

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,160
us

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,240
you know some opportunity to work uh

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
with the mainframe with z os that maybe

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,600
we couldn't have before

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,440
but what i think has been missing is

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
what's really picking up traction now

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,120
in year two going into year three is the

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,440
ability for the administration of

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,720
management it's having the api interface

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,400
that you can work with it's that you can

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360
actually do some really cool things with

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,960
the cla

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
that give that in that management and

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
administration it's not just oh yeah i

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,600
could deploy code to it or

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,759
yeah i can use vs code to see some

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,360
things um you know

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,199
that's what kind of the initial reaction

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,880
was and i was like no wait this is

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,280
actually a lot more powerful than that

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
let me

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,039
see what else i can build and we see

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,680
some really cool advancements on top of

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,600
that

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,759
ibm has been working across all of its

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,800
different development teams kicks db2

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,280
ims um to use the zoo

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,319
zoe you know either cli or the apis to

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,560
actually build out

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,440
and allow for more interaction with

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
their

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,120
uh different subsystems and things like

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,319
that so we're constantly seeing more and

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
more advancement

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
um because of what the base open source

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,080
project has done

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,759
now all these different teams can also

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
say hey i can actually make that work

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,319
more for me

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
and so we're seeing that and it being

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
you know opened up as well to the

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,759
community

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,440
for more uh usage and

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,880
open issues and kind of driving where it

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,720
goes

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,479
definitely and and thinking about that

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,880
administrative um

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,479
part of of the things that zoe could

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,840
potentially manage

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,039
you know the one thing that always comes

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
to mind one and you know where i'm going

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,599
to be going with this

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,039
is the great uh demo that alex kim

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
or actually in a demo it's a fully

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,199
working um tool

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,199
that alex kim has put out um you know

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
from viacom infinity and i and uh

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
the viva which i absolutely love mostly

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,080
because back when we were in conferences

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,960
in person he was carrying it around in a

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,479
suitcase

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,680
and if you want to do a demo you just

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,319
open the suitcase and just start doing

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
it on the

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,520
top but tell me a little bit about that

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
and tell me just you know what the

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
experience has been like and what's that

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,759
meant for vicom infinity

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,680
well thank you john for mentioning this

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,240
uh viva vicom

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,840
infinity voice assistant um i'm sure

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,840
everybody knows

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,479
alexa and google home and so on

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,240
the consumer types of voice assistants

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,360
but

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,319
we started getting this idea uh starting

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,599
with alex

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,919
kim on our team that wouldn't it be

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,120
kind of cool to be able to have voice

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,199
control

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,240
of the ibm mainframe and

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,760
the thing that concerned us with

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,719
using alexa or google was home was

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,440
because

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,640
of their security exposures they're

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,599
really designed for

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,719
consumer level types of of you know

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,760
voice

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,279
and enterprise customers uh z os

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,279
customers linux on z

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,080
customers you know zvm tpf psc

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,680
all those kinds of customers would be

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,240
very apprehensive

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
using a consumer level type of voice

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,279
assistant but

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,160
when when zoe came along uh we got

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,839
the idea that hey we could actually take

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,000
advantage of the security of the

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,200
mainframe because it interfaces

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,120
with apis very nicely

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,560
into z os and other um

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
the their other operating systems

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,279
available on the z very

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,800
transparently and before we knew it we

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,800
had the viva assistant

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
talking to the mainframe and when you

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,200
talk to the mainframe

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,000
you wait what you say is you know how

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,600
you say hey alexa or hey google

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,880
well you say hey tj now

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
tj has a lot to do with the building

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,720
that's

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,000
right behind my head here and then

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,760
we're just going to ask you how it all

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
tied in together so i'm glad you called

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,080
that

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,360
out yeah it's the original lab

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,120
in endicott new york where ibm

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,320
incorporated in 1924

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,079
and i have a lot of my family

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,839
starting with my grandfather and my

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,760
father and then me and a lot of other

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,399
relatives and aunts and uncles that all

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,160
worked there

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
because that's where our family settled

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,040
when they first came

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,720
to the united states from italy

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,880
and i was destined to be part of the ibm

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,240
family i guess i didn't realize it

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,240
but it turned out very well and my

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,440
office is in that building

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
right over my shoulder and the first

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,320
floor of that building

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
and it was right next to the original

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,880
office for thomas j

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,519
watson senior the founder

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,800
of ibm that's where the name tj came

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,360
from so we thought it'd be

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,279
out of nice respect and remembrance of

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,880
him and it's worked out very well

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,160
so this voice assistant

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,320
is no longer a prototype it's actually a

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,200
product it's actually registered in the

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
ibm

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,680
global applications registry where

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,480
people can

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,000
look at it online anytime and um see

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,079
what it's all about and what what the

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,440
solution has to offer

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,839
so isn't that funny using uh those kinds

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,920
of interfaces

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,600
uh and thanks to the

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,920
nice work that the open mainframe

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
project did and

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
bring bringing some semblance around the

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,000
project of zoe

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,360
and making it really what it is today

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,279
that is absolutely fabulous it's a

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
really cool story i mean jen have you

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,839
seen sort of other stories like that out

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,600
in the

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,279
customers and folks that you're working

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,440
with of just something

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,480
interesting something cool that has you

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,680
know broadened

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,240
brought up um because of zoe

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,120
um not quite as cool as that it's hard

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
to top that

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,760
that is true that is true so you know

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
it's not a competition it's not a

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
contest but i'm sure there's other

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,959
interesting things

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,200
yeah so um it's actually

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,320
i guess enabled a lot of um new

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,639
opportunities so

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
one of the things that we ibm do every

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,959
year is the master the mainframe

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,000
uh competition where we are encouraging

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,680
students to go out and produce the

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,639
platform and actually this year

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,920
we're leveraging zoe through vs code for

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,160
the whole competition

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,959
um which enables just a new way to work

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,720
with the techno

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,760
with the xeos platform we all know and

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
love but something that wouldn't have

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,680
been possible

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
two years ago but now we can and it's

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
just brought a whole new life and really

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
kind of reinvigorated

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,639
um the competition i love it for some

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
other reasons we won't go into those

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,320
today

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,600
but it does bring a kind of a modern

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,839
look and feel

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
and just allows people to focus on

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,760
learning with technology

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,360
and not doing a bunch of setup because

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,279
the setup's quite simple

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,360
yes yes that's one piece of feedback

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,200
i've heard quite a bit is just it's it's

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,639
all ready to go it's much simpler

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,480
through vs code it's already a tool that

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,240
students have at their disposal

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,880
so they're not trying to set up a 3270

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,800
emulator and all sorts of other pieces

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,079
yeah and that's actually um one of the

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,079
things i really love so

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,079
i tend to work with a lot of cloud-based

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,360
technologists and they

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,800
don't want to think about where server

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
is they don't want to have to care they

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,240
typically have a few different

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,519
you know ide set up vs code being open

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,800
source is one of the ones people

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,560
commonly will have

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,880
and so when i can say hey just add this

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,040
tool let me give you the ip address

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,160
they're pretty happy and and they're

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,079
good to go and they're

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,399
then willing to learn to work with the

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,959
platform whereas before i may have been

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,440
like oh

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,279
can we find a you know 3270 emulator or

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,320
well we really need some other tools or

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,639
things like that and it's hard to be

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
like

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,360
you know people are going to put their

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,639
shoulders up and like i don't know

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,639
that's a lot of extra work

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,079
yeah um so it's really kind of opened it

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,440
up to different mindsets

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,000
i'm able to show that you can do a lot

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
of the same things on

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
from that you would do with cloud you

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,839
can do one z and things like

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,279
um zoe enable that because it just looks

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
exactly the same and you can switch

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,800
perspectives and things like that and

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,360
make it happen

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,120
it's fantastic it's it's it's amazing as

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,760
this community has come together

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
how this has evolved over time and just

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,480
the new opportunities that open up and

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
just things like that i

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,320
wasn't too long ago i learned that the

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,160
masterminding program was using that and

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
i just thought that was just amazing

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,199
of just how much that's made a

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
transformational step and moving that

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,720
forward

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,680
so it's been really fabulous um moving

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,279
ahead here

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,480
so we're one of the key pieces

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:24,480
of the zoe framework

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,839
and project is new interfaces

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,760
some of them not necessarily new they've

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,680
been in there a long time but pulling it

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,360
together into a singular api

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,199
mediation layer and the concept

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,399
you know and jen you've been out working

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,240
you know as a developer advocate with

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,079
people before and i throw the term api

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,120
first out there and that's just

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,639
second nature i can only imagine and now

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,399
that sounded came to the mainframe

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,839
that's a huge huge step tell me

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,720
tell me a little bit more about like how

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
that api first mentality now that it's

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
getting to the mainframe and i know

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,639
you've seen this in the cloud world in

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,839
other worlds and so that's kind of

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,120
you know farther up the curve but you're

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,120
seeing this at the front end of the

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,440
curve tell me what that's like

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,040
yeah so whenever you are starting to

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,160
talk about you know different components

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,600
you want to put them together that's

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,079
generally the first question is okay

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,320
well

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,360
what is the api look like you know can

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
you give me an api

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
endpoint you know do they have a swagger

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,440
page you know how can i look at how this

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,480
is going to work

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,279
so having that kind of api mediation

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,839
layer

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,120
um really just opens the doors to

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,800
possibilities

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,040
so if we go back a little bit and we

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,399
look at something like zos connect when

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
that first came out

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,000
and when you might remember how many

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
years ago they start to blur together

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,720
you're better at remembering

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,759
the differentiations i am um you know

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,079
that was like

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,759
this is like huge moment for the zos

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,959
platform like oh my gosh we can

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,600
you know api enable kicks and db2 and

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,600
ims

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,959
and this was really awesome but now it's

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,279
always saying well hey

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,040
not only can you api enable that but you

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,720
can actually api enable you know your

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,440
management and your administration which

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,120
we haven't

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
really done as well before things like

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,000
cosmetic you know kind of started to

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,360
enable it

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,839
zoe works with that even more um

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,680
but then we also continue to see further

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
development to have that api first

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,160
extended to the mainframe so kix has

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,519
graphql

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,360
that's now available to work with the

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,800
kicks bundle so if you like graphql

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,680
that's another api layer that makes it

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,079
really simple to

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,160
do kicks bundled appointments so as we

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,560
continue to expand this idea of api

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,040
first

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,880
working with the open source community

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,560
it just opens up the doors so that we

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,199
can use some of the common skill sets

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,880
that we have

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,880
across other platforms across other

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
technologies um to

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,440
allow more people to work with such a

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,399
powerful platform

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
that's very cool and you know the api

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,120
first sort of approach

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,959
is certainly something that the

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,399
customers that you work with i mean a

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,000
number of them i know work

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,240
in many of our other linux foundation

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
projects as well and the concept of api

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,079
first as i know is a part of them as

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,920
well

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,759
but now bringing that to the mainframe

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,399
what have you seen the impact in the

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,360
customers that you're working with

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,880
well first of all they have been able to

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,199
open up the mainframe

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
uh in a secure way because these

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,520
connections through

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,559
the restful apis all adhere to

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,839
the the security uh rules

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,640
and regulations that the mainframe

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,520
follows so that's one very good thing

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,760
because

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,439
especially you know being involved a lot

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,880
with the financial firms like i

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,480
i am on on wall street they really

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,280
found that to be very helpful because

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,200
then it's helping them to bridge

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,000
their way into a hybrid multi-cloud

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,160
environment which

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,280
everybody's trying to do and most of

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
them have found

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,200
that they were trying to or at least

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,679
they thought they could in the beginning

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
oh

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,880
here comes the cloud we can get rid of

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
all our infrastructure let alone the

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,000
mainframe

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,440
and well right away they found out that

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,160
wasn't the case

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,960
uh there were some very nice things that

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,120
could go

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,000
to the cloud and should be on the cloud

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,240
but there are

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
things that just can't go to the cloud

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,200
and need to

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,360
remain for compliance rules and

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,080
regulations and this api

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,120
capability just made it so nice to blend

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,880
everything very

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,640
transparently together and

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,679
you know it also opened up to other

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,480
software houses that were not

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,080
um looking at the mainframe one that we

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,039
happened to meet was a place called

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,480
private key

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:27,520
you remember that uh john and

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,120
private key is integrated through apis

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,160
with the uh viva and

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,280
oh wow i didn't realize that yeah

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,840
and it allows um

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,200
you know you know how you go to a bank

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,640
online and you get a

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,840
code back to verify that it's you right

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,320
well this does this with viva

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,440
and it does it so transparently so

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,520
quickly

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,640
you hardly notice any interruption but

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,160
it verifies

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,230
um you know this intention for a

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,480
transaction

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,600
[Music]

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,679
through the use of this tooling that

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,200
came available with apis when it

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,880
was made available with zoe and

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,360
zos connect and a lot of other things

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,039
and in jen's

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,840
world with with cics

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,600
now private key is looking at

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,760
interfacing directly

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,039
to cics through these apis

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,720
yeah so it's uh going to make uh

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,160
really very nice for the for the

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,280
mainframe and those in the mainframe

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,039
world

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,120
i love it that we've done this recording

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,960
three times and every time i learned

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
something entirely new out of it it is

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
just so fabulous so

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,320
for the folks at home if you see this

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
repeat everyone is unique you

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,840
really got to check them all out so it's

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,880
it's it's very cool

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,679
and you know it's it's great the one

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
thing i've been

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,440
you know not as not as long involved in

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,679
the mainframe world as either of you

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,880
but i i have the privilege of being able

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
to speak with a number of customers

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,600
speak with a number of vendors sort of

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,600
understand

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,640
where their challenges are you know from

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,919
a different angle

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,799
and the one thing that i've always found

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,480
interesting

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,679
is you know it in the early days it

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,520
seemed like when i was starting this

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,440
project was very mainframe

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,799
or not like it was an either or

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,440
proposition

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,200
and the one barrier the project has been

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,919
slowly trying to open up

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
is the mainframe and because if i look

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,559
at

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,159
many of you know the things that i've

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,520
done in my career and the organizations

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,400
i've worked with

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,080
um it's it's always been clear that an

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,000
organization that has a hybrid

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,320
approach to solving their computing

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,640
challenges ends up being

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,919
one that is ahead they're unique they

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,240
have all this sort of unique

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,520
differentiator between their competitors

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,520
because they've taken the time and

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,520
really built up that custom way to

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,760
engage their customers and

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,440
maintain their infrastructure anyone to

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,440
approach how they work their business

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,960
and you know mainframe's always sort of

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,039
been a little bit that one thing on the

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,400
side here and the api first coming

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,840
together and i think both of you just

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,080
illustrated this perfectly

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,600
it's just opening up those last areas

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,360
that have needed to be opened up

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,640
and it's really just changed a lot of

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,200
the trajectory

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,320
getting from that mainframe or mentality

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,320
to the mainframe

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,120
and mentality which i think has been

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,120
really interesting

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,159
well cool up last question for the group

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,559
here and this is

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,600
always the fun one of looking into the

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,520
future

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,640
and len maybe let's start with you on

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,880
this one

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,080
future of devops in the mainframe what

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,080
are you seeing out there

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:44,080
it is starting to really become

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,400
part of the mentality of the mainframe

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,120
groups within organizations that's what

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,799
i see happening

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,240
they are becoming more comfortable with

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,159
it because of

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,919
the kind of tooling especially some of

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,039
the things we just talked about becoming

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,600
available

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,640
to allow it to fit into there into the

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,320
world of devops so that

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:10,400
they can take advantage of ci cd uh

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:14,000
continues integration continuous

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,919
development that um other platforms

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,120
have had the lead on and you know

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,799
one on one of our other sessions that we

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,280
had john you might remember

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
it really helps the mainframe become

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,320
part of the

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
overall family and you know family is

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
very important

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,559
especially when we start thinking about

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,320
this time of year with holidays and

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,400
everything else coming up

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,159
if you all become one big family you all

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,280
become more trusting of each other and

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,840
know how

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,039
whose strengths and each other's

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,880
i wouldn't say weaknesses but

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,120
differences um

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,440
and actually instead of using the word

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,280
strengths and differences i like to say

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,440
use each other for what you're designed

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,480
to do you know mainframe designed to do

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,400
different things

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,400
than what other platforms are other

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,159
alternative platforms are designed to do

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,520
and as soon the customers that are

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,600
starting to get that

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,360
and have gotten it for a while have

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,919
learned how to blend

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,200
the environments and especially with

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,320
that concept of the

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,760
hybrid multi-cloud also not just only

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,320
on-prem infrastructure

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
integration

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,600
that's fantastic and and i love the

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,400
concept of family

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,000
and when i think of family you know you

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,520
always think of longevity because

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,440
families are generations

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,120
they're not just one group but it's a

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,760
generational thing over time

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,880
and when we think about open source

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,159
projects

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
you're not just at the open mainframe

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,240
project but just broadly at the linux

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,039
foundation

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,840
that where we get involved with there

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,400
are ones

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,000
that look at sustainability as a key

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
part of that and sustainability

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,120
means it's not just a few years thing

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,840
it's not just

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,559
you know one generation it's a long-term

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,480
investment

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,679
mainframe's you know been around you

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,159
know since you know

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,960
geez you know almost 65 years now uh

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,559
longer if you

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,480
you get some of the early machines in

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,640
there and when i see

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,520
efforts like zoe being trusted into a

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,919
group like this

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,080
and other ones that have came along a

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,679
recent one cbt tape which

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,400
uh maybe not familiar with most of the

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,400
audience but if you're looking um

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
at the early work and share and those

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,159
early collaborations that came together

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,240
in a canonical tape in 1975 probably

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
one of the oldest open source projects

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,080
before open source projects were there

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,760
more of those are turning towards this

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
direction if we want to continue this we

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,919
want to pay this forward we want to take

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,640
this

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,000
not just for the next generation but for

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,799
generations to come

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,760
and i think that really that concept of

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,440
family really is

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,520
is a great way to kind of circle all

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,559
that together uh jen what are your send

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,640
me your thoughts as you look at the

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,159
future of devops in the mainframe

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,919
it's kind of a mix of what you're just

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
saying about family but also a mix of

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,960
john what you said before about

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,159
it it's no longer a mainframe or it's

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,559
mainframe and or and it really

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,240
is that so to me the future of devops

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,159
in regards to the mainframe is really

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,000
the blending of

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,919
coming together as that family across

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,440
your entire organization

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,120
it's regardless of what kind of

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,799
developer you might be you're going to

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,720
have the tools that you need to use so

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,720
whether you're a data developer whether

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,480
you're an application developer your ui

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,679
ux whatever

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,679
you're going to have the tools you need

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,760
to get the job done and

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,600
they're going to be able to integrate

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,640
with the with the repository with source

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,320
code management

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,400
that there will be processes in place to

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,120
allow the automation and deployment to

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,640
the backend

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,240
uh platforms that are available to

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
whether it's a cloud platform whether

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,840
it's a

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,440
in-house platform doesn't matter that

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,679
those things can all work together

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,559
and historically kind of mainframe was

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,120
always

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,279
unique um it had its own repository it

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,120
had its own tools

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,480
we very much controlled deployment and

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,080
we still absolutely want to have the

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,559
checks and bounces in place it's not

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,640
just you know release release something

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,039
and without having everything in place

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,880
but we now are we have the ability and

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,320
really are trying to integrate to say

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,600
yeah we could use those tools we could

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,960
still put those checks and bounces in

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,960
place but we can actually fit

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,159
the same devops pipeline we can now have

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
that ci cd

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,760
that continuous integration continuous

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,200
delivery you can use whatever

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,960
framework for development that you want

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,640
to do but those tools

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,240
by the time your code is ready we can

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,200
actually use those same tools to get to

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,039
our platform

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,720
so actually does allow us to all come

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,400
together as a family bring our unique

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,400
characteristics to actually make things

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,320
the best that they can be

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,440
exactly and be able to all have dinner

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,520
on the same table

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,960
and enjoy one another and you know

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,880
leverage all of that

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,799
great heritage and things that that

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,400
while make us unique also bring us also

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,080
together it's it's such a

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,840
such a great analogy and i look at it

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,440
very much the same way uh i mean turn

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,360
back the table five years how many times

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,320
would you have seen devops and mainframe

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,039
mentioned in the same sentence and now

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,480
this is

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,320
we're doing a panel about this we're

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
doing a panel because this is mentioned

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,559
all over right now i mean i know jen

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,400
you've

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,039
you've seen it you've contributed to

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,240
articles i know in the space as well and

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,400
uh len you're seeing it with your

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:11,440
customers but it's just it's fantastic

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:13,200
to see this all just coming together and

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
you know that we're i'm i'm usually

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,240
really bad at being a soothsayer on

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,360
things so i never like to do predictions

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,960
of the future

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,360
but what i will say is i think we're

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,159
seeing this beginning to grow and seeing

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,919
organizations not only looking at that

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,120
mainframe and looking at the investments

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,960
that are happening there and

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,799
figuring out how they fit more in the

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,000
line of business but

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,840
maybe there's some potentially some

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,360
customers out there thinking geez that's

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,440
a hardware i can take advantage of

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,080
there's some really useful things

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,039
that i can't do otherwise that maybe i

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,520
need to have this

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,640
as a part of my it infrastructure yeah

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,440
and if you watch

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,799
the open rain frame group if you join

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,320
the slack channels and things like that

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,200
you'll see people asking and looking for

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,399
those opportunities like

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,760
i've been hearing about this i'd really

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,720
like to try it i'd really like to learn

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,960
more

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,279
that's awesome it would have been hard a

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,799
few years ago to find those people

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,039
if they could find things like the

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,640
listserv that was available

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,120
they they really had hunted and they

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,880
tried and so you kind of we've now made

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,159
that barrier a little easier it's easier

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
to find where you can

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,440
you know ask that community you don't

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
feel like so much of an outsider you can

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,399
see people

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,240
active and talking and that really does

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,240
change everything having that community

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,640
having it being available and welcoming

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
um and that will only continue to drive

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,480
where the future of devops go because

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,399
you

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,440
as you get more people interested you're

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,039
gonna need to drive more of that

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,679
integration more of that family and that

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,960
community working together

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,520
and that certainly have happened here i

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,720
think since uh zoe came in two years ago

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,440
the year after we doubled

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,919
the number of projects in 2019 and then

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,840
2020 we're on pace to double it again

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,760
which you know shows that that's the

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,200
community's coming together and it's all

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
it's all in different realms and we've

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,480
seen a lot of work in cobol in the last

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,520
year without a lot of the needs of our

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,200
society

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,559
but we've also seen you know further

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,360
investments even in the

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,159
devops and education spaces as well so

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,080
it's it's

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,440
it's a great time to be involved in

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,039
mainframe and it's also

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,480
just great to see for this community for

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,480
so many people that have put their lives

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,640
in their careers into it

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,480
that are wanting to carry this forward

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
and i've heard from so many of them that

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,799
that's

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,000
one of their big things is how do we

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,240
carry this forward

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,760
and to be in this position where this

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,720
project is able to do that is

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,720
