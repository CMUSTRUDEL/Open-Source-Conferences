	00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,799
so i'm gonna be uh talking about uh uh

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,519
uh localization right um

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,559
so uh localization has has been a quite

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
a big headache

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,480
uh ever since i started working for the

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,400
next foundation 11 years ago

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,480
so uh my interest is how you know we can

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,240
uh uh we can make more people uh

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,920
uh uh work on localization

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,960
uh with a lot of joy and with a lot of

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,880
productivity

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
so that's uh that's the uh that's the

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,360
goal of my activity

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,480
uh related to localization

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,680
so uh this is uh the key

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,440
topics of this talk all right so

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,440
uh one other thing i would like to touch

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,600
upon is how technology can actually

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,480
solve the issue with localization

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,360
right so uh localization has been uh

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,559
largely

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,440
manual work but uh by taking advantage

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,640
of technologies

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,960
we can actually make it uh easier

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,399
and probably more fun so that's one

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,439
thing i'd like to talk about

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,560
and the other is uh uh okay then you

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,560
know if we take

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,479
take advantage of technology so what are

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,880
the tools uh technology tools

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,159
that we can take advantage of so that's

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,600
the other thing i'd like to

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,040
touch upon uh uh during this

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,119
presentation and the other thing um

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,240
probably the most important thing is how

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,880
we can make the localization work

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
more fun and productive so those are the

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
those are the three things i would like

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,360
to uh

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:39,520
talk uh during my presentation

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,240
so uh as i mentioned earlier

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,000
localization uh is a big headache for

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,960
local open source communities

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,439
so uh the impact of the language barrier

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
to the

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,880
industry in non-english speaking country

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,640
is actually huge and this is

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,680
particularly true unfortunately

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,000
in japan uh because uh japanese people's

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
english uh proficiency is one of the

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,479
lowest in asia

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,360
ranked 53rd in the world

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,000
and without but without localization the

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,959
new

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
technology originated overseas will not

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,040
be spread

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,239
in non-english speaking countries again

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,599
like in japan

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,560
so we need uh we need uh

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,480
we need a localization for uh for local

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,520
community to catch up with the latest

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,640
technology trend

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,599
overseas and it is

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,080
it is impossible to make everyone to

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,280
become

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,319
able to uh communicate reading and

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,760
communicating english language but it

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,040
is possible to localize

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,200
more documents and

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
you know localize a lot faster those

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
documents

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
by taking advantage of technologies so

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,160
uh

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,519
you know localization is a big headache

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,080
but i would like to uh

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
uh you know i would like to solve this

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,159
uh problem

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,360
with the technologies and community

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,640
so uh uh now

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,760
so in order to solve this technology

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,480
in order to tackle this uh uh issue i'd

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
like to uh

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,239
first of all understand uh what is the

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,000
localization work

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
the name what is the nature of the

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,159
localization work

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,200
right so uh localization work is

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,239
actually uh

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,640
uh made up by two elements

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,440
one is translation the other is

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,720
interpersonal

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,760
in interpretation the translation

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,519
is a relatively uh

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,239
lower value added work because

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,840
this requires only a language skill

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
whereas

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,440
interpretation requires

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,720
a specific uh technology uh background

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,159
or technology uh uh

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,480
technical knowledge to be able to uh uh

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:05,680
to be able to you know uh um for example

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,599
uh you know if you uh uh if you know

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,200
a new uh uh a technical term or created

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,720
uh in english then uh the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
the people who who does the

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,519
interpretation work will have to

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,919
understand uh what is that technology

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,720
and

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,000
what would be the best uh uh

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
interpretation with

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,759
uh terminology that you know that can be

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,680
uh

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,560
used in you know for example in japanese

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,560
language

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,199
so this is actually a really high value

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
added work

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,120
but uh today localization work

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
uh localization work both interpretation

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,360
translation

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:53,199
uh a largely uh manual work by human

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,360
but uh in the future uh

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,199
you know among the interpretation and

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
translation in between interpretation

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,759
translation

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,039
is a lower network translation

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,080
it can be replaced by a

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,479
machine the technology while

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,479
interpretation will remain you know in

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,880
the human world because this requires a

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,080
very

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,199
specific uh technology or industry uh

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
uh skill or knowledge

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,600
so uh uh in order to make uh translation

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,199
uh more you know localization work more

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,000
uh uh i say uh productive

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,360
and fun we need an open and common

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,600
platform for open

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,720
source communities so uh

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,960
to be more specific we would like to uh

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,320
you know we need a tool uh we need a

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,880
common platform

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,000
to make uh the translation part not

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,039
interpretation part

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,919
translation part uh uh

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,199
you know to be done by uh machine or

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,080
tools

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,840
so uh i you know my hope is that we like

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:09,199
to uh get our first together to build a

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:13,120
common platform to uh you know

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,120
to automate the translation part

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,919
so what we need in order in order to

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
make that happen

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,680
what are the uh what are the

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
requirements so uh i'm thinking you know

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,199
these three are the

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,560
key recommended requirements uh to make

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,759
that happen

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,880
one is uh everyone to use the tool

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,080
to translate and share the translation

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,560
memory this is the important

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440
part you know uh not only just not do

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,160
the translation

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,319
but share the translation memory that's

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,560
the one one thing that is important

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,479
the second part is train the machine

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
translation engine

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,680
that is optimized for open source

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
industry right

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,120
so uh you know there are a machine

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,800
translation engine out there

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,560
uh you know probably not many people

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,840
actually use it but uh

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
uh in order uh for us to uh be able to

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,520
uh

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,960
uh you know efficiently use the engine

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,639
the engine will have to be uh uh

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,680
optimized for open source industry usage

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,840
and third and again this is the uh

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,080
the most important part build the

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,080
mindset and process

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,400
that the translation will have to be

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,759
done by the community

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,039
and no no never do it at all but this is

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,080
important part

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,319
and share the result together

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,360
with the community so those are the

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,639
three things

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,400
that has to happen uh for the

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,479
localization work to become

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,479
more fun and more productive

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,879
so um uh what is the you know uh i

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,520
mentioned that

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,479
you know uh everyone use the test sim to

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,800
to translate

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,039
and share the translation memory right i

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,639
said shared determination memory is

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,639
quite important

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,000
what is the translation memory and why

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,280
it matters

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,360
so uh uh translation memory

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,120
is basically a database of you know

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,599
translated uh words

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
and you know it can be a sentence or

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
paragraph

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,599
or a sentence like units like you know

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,919
headings titles elements in the list

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,039
that have previously been translated in

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,560
order to uh

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,360
previously translate it so uh this is a

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,479
basically

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,039
the translation memory and

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,199
one good news is that you know there is

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,919
an industry standard file format

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
for the translation memory exchange tmx

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,360
file

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,320
format and so

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,080
people are actually able to generate the

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,680
translation memory with the standard

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
file format and actually share the

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,640
memory

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
and make memory to get make the

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,360
translation memory

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,680
better by collaborating

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,399
and also uh they you know uh regardless

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,880
of the tool

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,680
uh people use you know uh they can

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,839
actually say

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,800
uh generate the same translation memory

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,519
and share it

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,560
so that's that's one good news and the

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,480
benefit

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,839
of using translation memories uh you

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,200
know there are

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,720
several memories uh several uh several

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,880
benefits

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,680
so uh one is the translation tool uh

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,480
will translate the same sentence words

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
or sentences like units automatically

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,240
and

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,120
able to uh avoid from translating the uh

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,000
those uh sentences words and sentence

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,320
like units

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
over and over so this is actually big

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,880
benefit

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,920
and um actually by doing that you know

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,560
uh uh specific uh terminologies

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,279
will be translated into the same local

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,839
language

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
so this is actually uh important uh for

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,959
example

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:56,160
uh english words with the container

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,279
maybe uh translated person a

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,399
might be a translate into one way but

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,760
you know a person b

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,800
might translate into the other way

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,839
but uh if the community

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,880
got together and used the same same

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,720
translation memory then this issue

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,880
actually be solved

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,079
right a container is a container there

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,040
there's only one

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,240
one single translation interpretation

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,360
now everyone using within the community

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,200
and also uh we can uh

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,560
by using the translation memory it's

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,519
actually a similar thing but

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,320
we can actually set the rule by the uh

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,640
you know

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,600
the transit translation rules by the

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,120
community so

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,360
uh community might um uh

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,600
might use one uh uh you know one

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
one terminology they would like to keep

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,320
that terminology uh

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,360
as a as in english right

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,560
and maybe some other term uh terminology

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,600
needs to be translated

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,560
into japanese but you know uh

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,959
you know so uh community just said uh

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,360
set

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,720
a rule that you know this term says in

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,800
english this term

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,120
will translate it something like that no

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,680
we know the community can set the rules

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,200
by using the translation memory so this

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,600
is the big benefit of

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,720
your uh using the attract these are the

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
big benefits

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,160
using translation memory so it actually

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160
matters a lot

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,000
so uh what what to do with the transmit

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,320
translation memories

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,399
so uh this is the uh uh what i'm

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,920
thinking the ideal uh process

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,320
of using it um

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,200
you know you know first of all get the

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,079
translation

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,120
memories from the community repository

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
then uh

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,680
use by using the translation memory work

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,760
on the translation

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,880
and the person will uh create a new

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,680
translation

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,959
so share that new translation memory

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,040
with the community

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,560
and uh then you know merge the new

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,800
generation memory with the

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,720
uh existing translation memory and

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,519
update the community uh

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
translation memory in the repository and

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,680
you know

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,560
keeping this cycle right and by

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,279
repeating this process over and over the

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,880
community

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,560
will get more and more translation

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,120
memories and less and

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,839
less duplicated translation so this is

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,639
the ideal

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,200
process okay

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,760
so uh let me uh let me uh touch upon uh

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,839
the uh

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,480
uh some of the uh available uh

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,800
translation tools

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,519
so one of the one of the two uh there's

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
a

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,880
uh used uh is omega t

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,240
this is an open source uh translation

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
tools

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,279
that anyone can actually uh download and

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,279
use

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
and uh i mentioned that you know there's

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,760
a one

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
a standard uh uh translation memory file

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,680
format

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,079
uh dmx but uh there are actually no uh

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
some you know several other uh uh file

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,320
formats

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:09,279
and uh omega t is uh

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,920
compatible to uh many variety of file

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,880
formats

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,880
like gtx gm xl and others

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,680
and also omega t is able to

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,880
translate over 30 document formats such

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,399
as microsoft word

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,040
excel ppt hd

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,839
html and others and of course open

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,839
document format

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,680
and also one of one of the good things

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,800
about you know uh this omega t

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,040
is uh it has got you know an interface

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,000
with a popular machine translation

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,440
engine such as

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,560
google and d2l so uh

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,800
uh you know when when you use omega t uh

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,639
use the community uh uh translation

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,120
memory is one thing

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,079
and the other uh thing uh uh you can

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,639
take advantage of

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,360
uh is uh use the machine translation

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,639
engine

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,639
such as google and dpl

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,639
and also one good uh one good uh point

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,199
about you know one benefit of using

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,440
omega t is that the tool works well for

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,959
group work

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,399
so uh uh if you uh would like to uh

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,000
uh uh use the tool of the community

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,560
translation

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,560
omega t is actually a one good option

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,839
that is suit for uh

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,199
uh that suits for the nature of the

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,680
uh uh collaborative work but

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,199
one downside of that tool is actually

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,199
this is actually not an easy tool

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,240
to learn and use this is actually you

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,800
know one downside that omega t uh has

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,760
but this is a really a great tool and

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
you know

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,680
um at linux foundation japan obviously

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,680
we have been using omega-3 a lot

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,560
past several years

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
and the other available tool uh is a

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,320
textura uh

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,040
translation editor so this is a

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,240
actually an online tool provided by a

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,920
national institution

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,399
of information and communications

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,600
technology we call uh

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,440
they call it an in ict this is the

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,079
japanese government of the uh

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,720
japanese funded uh research institute

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,600
and uh this texture uh translation

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
editor is

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,920
not a not an open source tool but uh

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,880
anyone can use it

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,279
use it uh for free and the license

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,199
though

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,720
is actually very clear for open source

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,759
usage so uh

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,480
uh what it means is uh if you use

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,199
you know like a popular uh translation

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,360
engine

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,120
oh by the way uh so this fixture

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,920
translation editor is there is a

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,399
uh this is the uh editor that you can

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,279
see

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,120
um you know you can see uh the graphic

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,120
on the right this is the editor

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
but behind this there is a translation

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,120
engine texture uh

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,759
uh tikistra translation engine right so

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,040
this is the machine translation tool

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,079
so uh if you use other machine

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,120
translation tool

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,320
uh then uh you might run

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,839
into an issue uh like you know uh what

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,880
is uh no uh you know if we

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,880
if i use uh

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,040
who is the uh uh owner

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,600
of the outcome of the translation right

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,759
so uh

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,440
machine translation you know you

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,600
actually are not the one

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,720
who actually do the translation actually

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,680
machine did it

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,399
so in that case uh who owns it no is it

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,519
is it free

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,480
is it is it you know no is it

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,800
okay to share the uh uh outcome of the

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,759
uh

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,480
translation with anyone right so this is

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
actually

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,639
not not too clear

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,680
if you use uh uh many of the uh

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,800
uh trends uh translation engine

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,000
but uh uh this texture is actually

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,759
really clear

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,400
that you know how we can actually uh use

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,679
it uh use it for uh open source project

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,919
and share uh

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,120
share the outcome of the uh machine

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,160
transit translation for free

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,039
so that's one thing and uh uh

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,959
and once again no uh this uh texture is

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,240
taking advantage of machine translation

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,880
engine

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,360
and uh one good thing about this is no

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,480
need to

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,960
install software on your pc so this is

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,919
actually quite easy

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,919
and uh just like omega t this uh it is

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,600
capable to translate many different

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,919
file formats like omega t and uh one

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
good

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,960
uh thing uh about you know this uh

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,240
texture is uh

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,559
it's capable to use with weak mode so

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,039
this is uh something not available with

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:54,559
the omega t

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,039
and one i personally feel you know one

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,919
the biggest

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,520
benefit of using a texture is

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,960
automatically more emerge the

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,600
translation memory

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,080
in engine and get trained if everyone

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,080
use this

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,480
and also are capable to generate a

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,520
grocery from the translation memory

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,880
but you know however one downside uh

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,480
one issue is uh uh you know in terms of

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,480
group translation work

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,320
uh this is not the uh uh the best

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,440
solution at this moment

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,440
so that's the one downside

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,120
so uh i brought uh one of the uh case

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,320
study

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,320
where actually a community uh

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,360
is getting got together and use the

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,160
tools and

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,080
uh work on uh try to build the process

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,320
of the community transmission

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,120
uh which is the hyper uh hyperledger

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,280
japanese

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,600
documentation working group so uh

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,360
they uh you know they are the group of

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,160
the translator

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,360
and and who work on the hyperledger

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,280
fabric

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,280
documentation localization

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,760
and the group uh you know the group

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,160
is using uh the github to collaborately

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,240
uh translate the documentation

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,919
and also the group also partly use the

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,679
translation memory uh which is

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,720
maintained on the git on github

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,280
however this is the issue however they

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,600
are still

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,880
facing difficulty to update the

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,520
translation memory by

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,400
aggregating feedbacks from the community

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,880
translator

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,799
and merge them to update the existing

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,520
translation memory

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,320
and also uh deleting the word which are

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,320
not appropriate

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,720
so uh and the reason why this happened

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,919
is

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,120
uh is because today it is simply not

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,200
easy to share

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,160
translation translation memory and

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,280
maintain

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,520
at one location so uh although

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,280
this hyperledger japanese documentation

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,960
uh working group

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,159
is trying to uh do the way

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,120
uh uh you know the way uh

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,600
i described uh in the audience right but

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,880
uh

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,799
you know they are facing actually

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,280
running into the issue

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,320
of uh actually doing it because it is

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,520
actually hard

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,480
to actually you know it's actually share

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,720
the transit

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,440
generate the translation and share it

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,440
and maintain it

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,360
so uh we are going to make

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,039
one step forward to remove that needle

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,440
of localization community

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,240
so we identify that this is the issue

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,960
right

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,159
so it's it's difficult to uh you know

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,120
although it's important

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,960
to uh share the translation memory but

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,919
it is not easy

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,120
so uh this is a needle right of the

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,320
localization

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,360
community so i would like to uh uh do

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,320
something about it

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,559
so we are going to make one support to

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,679
uh to do that

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,480
so uh today i'd like to make one

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,240
announcement

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,440
about uh nicp i mentioned earlier that

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,480
who actually developed the uh fixture

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,080
translation engine and the linux

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,159
function will collaborate

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,559
on texture right so by using the tool

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,400
by using a community translation we

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,720
should be able to get

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,919
a lot better productivity obviously

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,640
so uh uh with a machine translation

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,679
engine optimized for open source usage

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,200
the productivity can become much higher

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,159
so this is uh one thing uh i you know uh

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,360
net uh nicp and the linux function japan

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,799
office would like to

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,240
achieve make the uh uh

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,480
create the uh uh

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,039
the translation engine that is optimized

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,360
for open source usage

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,720
so uh to do that you know nict and the

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,039
linux foundation

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,520
has reached agreement to work together

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,320
to train texture machine translation

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,640
engine

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,000
to optimize it for open source community

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,360
use so that's the uh

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,799
that's the agreement and this is just

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,000
the announcement today

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,840
and uh uh moving forward uh what we

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,280
are going to do is uh the linux

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,320
foundation will host

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,080
extra at linux financial server

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,520
and which will be opened up for the

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:37,280
local open source user community to use

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,840
and also nicd and the linux function

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,480
nx linux foundation will collaborate to

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,200
taco

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,559
to add the group work feature to texture

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,799
as i mentioned that you know

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,320
texture is weak at you know group group

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,919
work functionality

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,120
so uh we we are going to we are going to

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,080
uh

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,799
try to add the group work feature to a

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,880
texture

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,760
so community can easily share the

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,760
translation memory

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,640
and also build and build an ecosystem

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,679
around the machine translation such as

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,200
a commercial uh commercial tool or

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,120
open source uh tools for uh cms you know

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,320
content management system like you know

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,600
uh

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,280
wordpress related like tools or and also

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,480
a git repository uh

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,200
or instant message messaging social uh

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,360
instant messaging or like social medias

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,559
and so on

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,640
so uh together with the nscte and

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:39,039
uh nct the linux foundation uh we try to

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,760
solve the needle let me solve the issue

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,520
of uh

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,919
uh issue

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,520
with the difficulty of sharing the

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,960
translation memories

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,600
within the community so uh

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,320
the value of using optimized machine

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,320
translation

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,760
engine so is like this right so

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,360
as i mentioned uh it's it is difficult

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,799
uh to actually generate the translation

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,760
memory and share it

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,159
share it and merge with the existing one

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,360
but

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,559
by use you know uh and

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,240
without machine translation you know

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,760
you know this process you know

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,039
communicate a translation this

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:27,440
five you know five cycle circles are

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,440
largely manual work right

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,880
but with machine translation these steps

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,760
can be automated because uh translation

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,000
uh translation

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,440
engine can take you know take care of

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,840
you know uh

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,279
basically you know sharing the uh

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,360
translation memory

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,720
and merging with the existing one and

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,760
updating it this is uh

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,400
done by machine translation machine

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,520
translation engine automatically

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,640
so this way

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,640
we can actually solve issue we faced

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,799
with the hyperledger high college

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,720
japanese documentation work group

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,559
right they they have they face the

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,919
difficulty

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:13,600
of sharing it

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,640
but no it no it will be automated

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,640
with the machine translation

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,799
and finally this is my final point after

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,960
all uh people matters most no uh you

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,559
know we work on the tools we want

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,880
we will work on the translation but uh

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,600
after all uh people actually matters

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,159
most no

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,120
uh to to be able to uh make the

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,960
localization work

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,720
fun and productive right so uh

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,720
one one thing that we have to do is

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,880
build the mindset and the process

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,000
to share the translation result and

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,559
memory

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
so mindset is basically you know

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,159
localization

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,120
work has fun collaborative work it's

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,400
it's not like not

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,720
something people do it alone

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,159
um you know

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,279
[Music]

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,520
alone by themselves right and

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,360
yeah and also a common repository not

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,720
only for the localization outcome but

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,440
you know uh we have to uh

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,480
we have to share the translation as well

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,720
and also work

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,760
work process it would be good to have

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,480
maintainers

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,400
uh commit committers and reviewers and

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,760
sign off by process

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,400
um just like noah we have you know

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,400
uh just like we have for uh developing

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,720
uh open source software

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,559
so this is uh you know this is one thing

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,840
uh we have to do

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,840
and also uh uh you know

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,279
the community localization can become

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,679
more fun

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,799
because of uh learning through the

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,279
localization

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,840
now we are able to learn new things like

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,799
you know

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,000
many of the technologies are created in

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,080
english language

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,760
but you know the people who actually do

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,640
the localization is actually not

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,400
the people who are actually learning uh

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,400
uh earlier than anyone else

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:06,720
so this is one a good good benefit

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,960
translator will have and also by

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,480
no uh taking an advantage open source

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,640
way of translating

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,400
uh the translation will become a

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,600
collaboration with others

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,000
not in a standard long project

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
so we can get feedback to the work and

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
we get a higher reputation

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,720
and we get an appreciation for the

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,520
community so

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
this is one good benefit our translator

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,480
can get

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,480
if we do it in the community way

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,120
and if we take a you know if you know we

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,240
are able to take advantage of uh

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,279
technology

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,760
uh we can actually eventually focus on

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,240
high

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,880
value added work you know interpretation

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,200
part

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,760
rather than you know uh you know

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:53,039
translation part

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,799
because the translation part uh will be

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,600
taken care by the like a machine

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,240
so you know you know people can uh focus

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,240
on

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,240
uh interpretation of new technology

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,000
understanding the context of new

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,200
technology and created

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,760
the uh appropriate world for the local

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,200
language

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,559
so this is actually a fun part so uh

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,760
these are the uh the things you know

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,720
we have to promote and we

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,880
we have to uh make people understand in

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,840
order for

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,279
localization work to become more fun and

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,039
productive so if you're interested in uh

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,960
please join us uh we have the

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,120
translate a collaborative translation

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,320
meetup in japanese language

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,559
um uh this uh this is this is a link to

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,000
the meetup.com we have we host

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,799
uh since you know due to the copy 19 we

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,880
have not

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,919

so universal community translators unite

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,039
and share the translation memory

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,039
thank you

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:41,840

so i can answer the question

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:28,080
so uh in the chat window uh

working to uh connect

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,960
omega t with the texture translation and

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,240
ng

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,960
so uh my hope is uh

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,840
uh uh no no we can connect we can use we

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,080
can still use omega t

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,559
uh and use the translation translation

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,399
uh texture translation edge

00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:04,399
oh yeah he actually i mentioned that in

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:07,039
