00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,280
i'm glad to be here with you today for

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,760
those of you who don't know me

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,800
let me introduce myself i'm woojin han

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,800
from dream ace

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,960
jeremy's joined agl at the silver level

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,199
in 2017

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
and we are specialized in developing and

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,599
customizing infotainment software

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,600
platform

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,040
based on agr and virtualization

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,280
technologies

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,399
and we've been widening our perspectives

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,840
ranging from

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,840
embedded technology to web platform

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,480
we've got some interesting topics to

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,800
show you during session

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,640
and we are really excited to share some

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,680
progress with you about the internet

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,480
copy system

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,760
as well as web platform we've been

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,239
working hard on this

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,280
we've got some information to share if

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,080
you have any questions

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,880
feel free to ask by asking your text

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,680
chatting system

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,439
during the speech our members including

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,520
chief technology innovation officer

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,640
ronnie are ready to answer your

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,920
questions

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,920
so let's get started

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
today we are going to start off by

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,520
talking about motivations

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,479
last year we shared our experiences

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,960
about the

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,600
asia-based container technology applied

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
to

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
mass production of leadership

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,799
entertainment products

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,040
as seen on the screen most of

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,000
applications such as music player

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
homescreen launcher etc were implemented

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,840
by

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,799
agr and android applications such as

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,119
navigation

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
game streaming players were able to

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,920
learn in

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,600
virtualization environments by using

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,600
windows container

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,520
after doing this project we've been

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,719
researching and discussing with several

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,119
clients

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,920
by doing so we decided to widen our

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,560
perspectives to internal copy system

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
as we all know internet copy system has

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,680
many advantages ranging from

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,720
holistic user experiences in the car to

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,959
cost saving and especially the number of

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,120
screens in the vehicle is increasing

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,480
and the size of screens is getting

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
larger and larger

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,760
so is very important to handle these

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
screens

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,959
effectively we think that our content

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,760
technology should be one of the good way

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:36,640
to meet

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:38,959
today's needs and interests

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,319
the second motivation of this topic is

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,519
about ecosystem

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,760
which contains both android and web

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,599
our previous research and product has

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,760
shown possibilities that

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
android ecosystem can be contained in

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,000
the azure system

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,080
by using container technology

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,159
on the other hand several players in the

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,640
asia has worked on web platform

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,080
to make web applications run effectively

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,200
in the azure system

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,319
for example chromium to relent and web

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,440
application manager

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,760
etc we also believe that

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,959
web applications can play an important

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,560
role in extending ecosystem of agr

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
we've been working closely with our

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,040
partner the web browser team of neighbor

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,720
which is one of the top internet service

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,159
providers in korea

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,319
and asia as well we've been focusing on

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,560
how to utilize existing web apps

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,480
how to make web developers not mistakes

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,200
making web applications for beacon

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,959
and packaging web applications and how

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,080
to build a web application store

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,080
in the agr system

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,560
now let me go to our approach and

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,560
current status

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
the first thing i'd like to show is the

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,159
concept of

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,560
our system architecture the blue colored

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
part

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,080
is standard azure architecture and the

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,239
green colored part

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
is the android container by using this

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
container

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,720
and yellow colored parts shows web

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,400
platform parts which is also isolated by

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,959
a loose container

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,600
under this concept since both android

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,359
environments

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,519
and web platform environment are

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,960
isolated by containers

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,040
passengers will be able to use

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,000
individual applications regardless of

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,280
open systems

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,199
and screens that they use in the car

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
furthermore container has many

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,320
advantages compared to hypervisor

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,479
in the aspects of scalability complexity

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,720
and cost saving

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,160
online quality activities regarding web

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
platform in egl

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,600
our approach is full browser-based web

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,759
platform

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,880
to pursue utilize existing web

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,759
applications

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,919
i mean both html5 web apps and

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,160
progressive web app contents

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,080
i will explain it in detail later

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560
currently we are focusing on the

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,479
infotainment part

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,960
although instrument cross expert group

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,280
has been working hard on close apart

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,000
the strict conditions such as real-time

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
processing

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,120
capability and high robustness level are

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,960
required by car makers

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,960
that's why many players have been

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,240
considering real-time os such as

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,680
qnx and integrity with hypervisor

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,000
solutions

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
so we've decided that we are going to

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,639
consider to use hypervisor to isolate

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
cluster parts and infotainment parts

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,440
until closer related functions in the

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,440
aegi will be stable and mature

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,360
in the meantime we will raise degree of

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,160
composition regarding what content

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,360
architecture

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,360
is seen on this page

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,000
now let's take a look at demo the

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,960
internet copy system powered by

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
container and platform technologies so

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
to see

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
to believe right it is the product of

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,320
our device development

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:22,120
so shall we start

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:24,500
[Music]

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,660
[Applause]

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,789
[Music]

00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,789
[Applause]

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,160
[Music]

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,759
in the past century automotive has been

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,240
evolving as a means to help people move

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,479
quickly and safely

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,039
interior parts also have been evolving

00:06:48,479 --> 00:07:03,840
rapidly together

00:06:51,039 --> 00:07:03,840
which enables people to receive driving

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:19,840
[Music]

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,840
most important thing in life

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
hello

00:07:36,180 --> 00:08:32,170
[Music]

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,170
[Applause]

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:48,180
[Music]

00:08:45,290 --> 00:09:12,620
[Applause]

00:08:48,180 --> 00:09:12,620
[Music]

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:41,270
[Music]

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:48,839
[Applause]

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:51,839
[Music]

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
yes

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,480
did you enjoy our demo i hope you may

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,320
see the potential inside

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,320
so let's examine this in a little more

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,040
[Music]

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,519
detail

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
first we've developed this prototype by

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,640
using

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,480
qualcomm's reference board this board

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
supports three kinds of qualcomm next

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,600
generation

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,600
automotive socs and we've chose sa8155

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,680
which has enough resource and computing

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,000
power to implement complicated interior

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,519
copy system requirements

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,480
we took agri 8.0 to happy halibut

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,279
and entered the qbsps for implementing

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
agr

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,839
and android container system most of

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,320
azure applications were developed by

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,360
using

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,560
qt whereas kanji ux framework

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,600
is used in cluster application although

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
our goal is to

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,160
complete 2b architecture in the right

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,839
side the blue colored one

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,040
currently implemented architecture is

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,399
shown in the left side of this page

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,880
cluster avn and rse is running

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,200
in the azure system and under container

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,320
runs in the separated environments

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,920
in other words we've completed all other

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,480
functions that we planned

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:14,560
but aga and android container has not

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:16,880
been merged yet

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
in order to allocate each container to

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,360
each display

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,279
we will try to configure multiple direct

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
rendering manager

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,399
unlike the other resources we have

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,880
experienced

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,079
it was a bit complicated and there was

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,880
trial and error

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,959
but we think the 2b architecture will be

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,680
finished in the near future because

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,399
we are now taking technical support from

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,839
qualcomm

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,839
regarding this issue

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,320
as seen on demo navigation screen of

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,040
avian display

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,880
can be played in the cluster display we

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,959
think this kind of multi-screen use

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,079
cases should be one of the main point of

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,440
differentiation

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,160
of the internet copy system cluster

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,880
application

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
is consists of two layers layer 1

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,519
presents

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
cluster functions and streaming server

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,279
is located in the layer 2.

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,440
in order to stream the android

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,120
navigation screen we've developed

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,160
streaming client and server

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,399
by modifying motion jpeg protocol

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,920
we've also modified the surface ranger

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,600
in android media framework

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,880
to implement streaming client function

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,800
so when the swipe event is detected

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,320
the streaming client starts to capture

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,320
and send navigation screen

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,600
to streaming server in the layer 2 of

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,480
cluster

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,440
the specific area of layer 1 is blanked

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,519
we can see

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,399
navigation screen of layer 2 through

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,360
this blanked area of layer 1.

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,959
from our experience motion jpeg is more

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,480
suitable for string protocol

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,880
than h.264 but we think

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,920
this could there could be alternatives

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,839
to do this job

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
and we have a plan to research more to

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,079
better perform on this end screen use

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,079
case

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,360
concurrent audio control is one of the

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,079
important issue

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
in the internet copy system we think

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
that

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
audio output data from the enter

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,040
container should be gathered in the

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,240
control unit

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,360
in the host os and could be managed and

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,440
sounded by the priority policy

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,360
this is because there are several sound

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,600
that needs to be sounded first

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
while other sounds should be dwindled or

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
muted

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
for example when the fca the forward

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,600
collision avoidance system

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,279
detects current threads and running

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,560
sounds should be sounded

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,560
other sounds such as music or navigation

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,320
should be muted to make passengers

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,320
recognize the

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,240
ultra situation clearly

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,360
our approach is to implement audio

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,480
server and clients

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,880
by using pulse audio together audio data

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,279
from

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,920
android container we've modified audio

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,079
fringe of android media framework

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,560
like the end screen case we think there

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,480
could be alternatives to this job and we

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,639
also have a plan to research more

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,199
to better perform on this audio mixing

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
use case

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,240
now let's go to the web platform proof

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,560
of concept development

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,920
we call it phase one development is

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,160
completed in

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,399
the environment as seen on the screen

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,320
the qualcomm's

00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:32,800
sa-8155 reference board and ajax 8.0

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,800
in this stage our goals to explore

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,360
existing web application store can be

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,519
applied to the embedded azure system

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,600
and to find out whether existing web

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
apps can be installed and operated where

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,199
or not

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,040
we found out that many web applications

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,760
use apis or functions of

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,120
latest chromium versions which premium

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,160
which chromium 68

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,079
included in the agr does not support and

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,560
web app store of our partner

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,079
can be performed where in the latest

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,959
chromium version

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,199
plus there are many progressive web apps

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,519
but chromium 68 does not support

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:13,839
pwa so we decided that we replace

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,920
chromium 68 in igl with chromium 83

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,040
and fixed several blocks in the chromium

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,000
83 version

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,120
such as video failure and starting

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,120
browser etc

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,199
in addition we found out that there are

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,440
many web apps

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,720
that needs keyboard input to use their

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,199
full functions

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,079
and keyboard is also necessary to use

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,639
webex store for searching web apps

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,639
by the way current web web platform of

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,320
agile does not support

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,639
ieme the input method editor yet

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,519
so we will decide if virtual keyboard

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,920
for

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,920
both web app and azure applications are

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,680
needed

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,279
one more thing we want to share our

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,360
experience is that we ported the

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,480
existing web app store to azure systems

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,639
successfully

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,639
and web apps are packaged by wizard

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,120
format which is the same way you're

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,240
packaging engine applications

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,880
both html5 web app and process web app

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,600
are packaged in the form of wgt the

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,000
widget

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,720
and these wizard files can be downloaded

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,959
and executed where in our system

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,800
this means that existing web apps and

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,959
web app stores are able to

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,959
jump into the age ecosystem

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,079
after finishing the phase on development

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,279
dreams and naver is decided to proceed

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,600
more bold idea this is what we call a

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,079
browser-driven web platform

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,639
the first motivation is to invite web

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,959
developers into agn

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,759
we've been developing browser to a user

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,000
interface

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,279
to communicate with javascript library

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,480
which web developers

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,560
are accustomed to by doing so

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,759
there is no need to know about agr for

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,240
developing web app

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,120
while agent framework and service layer

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,360
is fully supported

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,559
the second motivation is to utilize web

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,360
app store

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,640
since our partner the neighbor has their

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,839
own web store

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,559
and browser so we think that it is a

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,039
good way

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,039
to deploy their experiences on browser

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,280
and web store

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,839
in this in the aspect of internal copy

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,360
system we assume that each passenger

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,559
want to use each screen

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,400
individually so we've decided that

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,200
browser driven web platform

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,240
is isolated by loose containers in which

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,240
we have expertise

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,960
here is the system architecture of our

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,679
proposed web platform

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,160
as mentioned in the previous page it is

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,280
based

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,760
on azure framework and service layer

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,480
during maze is preceding where azure

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,720
interface

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
and vehicle info service while a

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,640
neighbor is in charge of

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,480
the browser and the application store

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,760
it is also web developer friendly

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,400
approach

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,039
this supports web application store that

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
both hr 5 apps and progressive web apps

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,120
can be registered in

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,320
form of widget packaging let me tell you

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,799
a little more in depth

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,360
about vehicle information service in the

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,360
next page

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,360
we think that it will be great if we if

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,240
web applications are able to use device

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,679
information of

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,320
car and control device functions

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,480
this could be a strong motivation for

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,679
web developers to jump into

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,720
automotive web ecosystem recently

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,960
we've engaged in w3c community

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,120
and one of the members from the vehicle

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,280
information service specification

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,400
suggested us to review vehicle

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,440
information apis

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,200
and its officers github as written in

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,600
this page

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,000
after reviewing this we think that using

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,200
this w3c vehicle information service

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,520
specification

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,720
helps us to save a large amount of time

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,120
and resources

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,360
while we are able to get stable and

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,600
modular implementation

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,720
now we are working on applying this

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,760
vehicle information service

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,520
specification

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,520
to agr service layer

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,600
this is the concept of web-based home

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,480
screen

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,520
of our proposed web platform it is fully

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,200
browser-powered

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,760
html5 home screen launcher it is under

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,799
design

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,320
now and will include many interesting

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,640
features ranging from

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,000
the floating widget to the push

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,480
notifications it says

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,480
et cetera

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,960
here is the court or during your dream

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,919
around is only a dream

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,520
a dream you dream together is a reality

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,280
to build strong ecosystem

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,720
we've been collaborating with prominent

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,520
players in the automotive industry

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,559
first in order to make stable hardware

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,320
with performance

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,320
we have been working closely with

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,200
continental automotive korea

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,480
to make this all happen in the aspect of

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,640
web ecosystem

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
we've been able to work with very team

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,840
of neighbor

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,039
and it's been our pleasure to work on

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,039
this great technology

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,080
also we are going to be collaborating

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,919
with automotive auto

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,320
service provider in korea wiper provides

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,000
on-demand mobile car wash

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,919
current provides on-demand car

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,919
maintenance and each app

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,360
provides real-time violent parking

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,799
service

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,480
they have been actively providing

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,799
services through the

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,799
ios and android but since this november

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,760
we've started to expand their service

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,280
experiences to web ecosystem

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,760
we are going to be doing innovation

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,960
together and we are looking for

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,320
potential partners continuously so

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,640
if you are interested in this

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,360
collaboration please do not hesitate to

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,360
contact us

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,440
now let me go on to plans

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
first the safety issue as mentioned

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,360
earlier

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,400
although the prototype is made of

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,799
multi-containers

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,559
is functional it is highly recommended

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,480
that cluster parts and infotainment

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,640
parts should be isolated

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,679
so we've decided that we are going to

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,720
consider to use

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,039
rtos and hypervisor to isolate the

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,760
cross-part infotainment part

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:43,360
until the glossary functions in the agr

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,360
will be stable and mature

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,240
second reducing hardware dependency

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,559
we've been leaving various kinds of

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,600
hardware platforms from different soc

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,720
manufacturers

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,159
by the request of potential clients when

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,880
it comes to applying our

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,919
container based copy system to new

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,320
platform

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,080
it was needed to keep integrating on the

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,960
newer azure versions and android

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,400
versions

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,280
and fix and improve some components

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,520
regarding different device drivers

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,280
so if we are able to find a way to

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,440
reduce hardware dependence

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,880
this definitely helps us to save a large

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,880
amount of time and resources

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,400
the third dynamic resource allocation of

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,360
multiple

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,120
you know containers under limited

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,960
hardware resources in the vehicle it

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,840
could be a good way to manage resources

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,320
of containers

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,000
in different situations such as

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,760
concurrent usual media

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,679
or game in the internet copy system

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,000
studying this topic by collaborating

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,360
with universities in korea

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,200
finally container based upgrade

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,600
we think that container-based upgrade

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,280
functions will enhance the advantage of

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,520
using containers

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,400
to do this we are going to be doing

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,720
research about

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,960
optimized file system to update each

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,200
container of the internal copy system

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,760
in the aspect of memory storage and

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,000
update speed

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,280
for example over a file system on this

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,120
container could be

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,120
a good way to achieve our goal

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,080
i just want to review that we've seen

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,240
today

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,159
we introduced our advanced research

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,520
regarding a user-based

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,159
copy system with web platform under this

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,400
multi-container-based architecture

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
since both centering both android

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,640
environments and web platform

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,520
environments

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,960
are isolated by containers passengers

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,799
will be able to use individual

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,679
applications regardless of operating

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,440
systems

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,440
and screens that they use in the car

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,559
unlike the current activities regarding

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,320
web platform in asia our approach is

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,360
full browser-based web platform

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,440
to pursue utilizing existing web apps

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,000
we imported web app store to azure

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,120
system and there's no need to fully

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,679
understand

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,640
how azure works by supporting browser to

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,520
azure interface layer

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,000
web developer friendly we also found out

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,080
that

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,640
pwa web app can be installed and

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,919
operated rare in our system

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,240
and vehicle information service

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,559
specification of w3c

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,400
will be applied to azure system to make

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,760
web applications control

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,000
automotive devices in the car

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,880
finally we've been working closely with

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,679
our partners

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,200
to build lg ecosystem we are always

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,159
welcome to discuss

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,159
future cooperation

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,320
thank you for all coming our session

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,320
today

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,720
and i hope you are interested in our

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,520
proposed internet copy system with web

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,919
platform

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,480
as much as we do if you have any

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,320
questions please let us know

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,360
and here is our field of interest

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,360
although our pro time was functional but

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,159
we know we have goal we have to go the

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,720
extra mile to be ready for production

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,159
as we all know there are many brilliant

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
there are many brilliant players are

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,679
working on the

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,120
azure community i hope we can have a

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,840
cooperation opportunity in the near

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
future

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:29,279
