good then uh thanks everybody

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,639
uh for joining today um um i

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:14,400
shortly want to introduce uh myself uh

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,800
my name is martin um i'm working uh

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,000
for dime the trucks since uh more than

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,119
15 years

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,720
currently i'm working in japan um

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,160
for the subsidiary of the asian uh truck

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,599
division a mitsubishi fusu truck

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,320
i'm here mainly coming from the finance

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,520
area

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,719
and project management so akash please

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,200
introduce yourself as well yep

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,040
so thanks everyone for joining uh and

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
good morning and good evening at your

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,360
time zones

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,719
so uh myself akash modi and uh i'm

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
basically a blockchain solution

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
architect

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,559
working for again camera trucks and all

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,160
the global divisions

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,440
and i'm mainly a research explorer in

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,640
machine to machine economy and vehicle

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,680
readiness for

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,400
such a market and how can we enable

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,479
these

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,960
vehicles to participate in the v2x

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,920
economic ecosystem

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,600
and i'm also always interested in

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,080
exploring new technologies

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
and see how those can be implemented in

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,799
the current uh

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,640
scenarios and what value they can break

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,799
and i have also uh patented

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,400
the economic identifier in the v2x

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,200
economy for the machines

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
which is recently got patented and

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
another patent which

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,479
i have done is know your machines

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
so and we are very strong forward

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,040
thinker

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,880
we always think that the trucks one day

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
can become fully autonomous and

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,560
we can enable that so that's a brief on

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
my behalf

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,720
and i'm sure that you will get to know

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,560
more as soon as you uh

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,520
proceed as soon as we proceed further

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,119
together on this talk

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,320
thanks martin thanks

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,440
good then uh let's start um

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,640
i think uh first let's give you a few

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,800
words uh

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,239
we are coming from the commercial

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,360
vehicle industry

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,400
so uh more or less trucks and buses um

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,080
trucks and buses there is uh

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,560
a big changes uh is is coming currently

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,160
and uh which will shape the future of

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,519
the uh

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,480
commercial vehicle industry uh one thing

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,319
is for sure the

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,760
alternative powertrains so

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:44,239
we are heavily working to replace uh um

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,760
traditional um gasoline and

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,280
diesel engines by electric uh fuel cell

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,000
uh powertrains um also the autonomous

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,680
driving

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,280
is one of the um game changer

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,319
in the future of the first vehicles

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,760
and the base for all is

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,400
the connectivity top we are um

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,480
on the way to connect every uh

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,920
commercial vehicles

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,959
which is uh sold to customer

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,879
not only um provide them with the trucks

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,159
but also with the services

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:26,319
of the trucks um our journey

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:29,920
um started i think three years ago

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,040
where we discussed about some business

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,560
cases

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,680
and prototypes about

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,120
sometimes involving a blockchain

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,560
and how the truck can utilize

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,000
technologies in the future um one of

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,560
the first learnings which we needed

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,280
to learn at the beginning is that in the

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,319
future

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,439
um so that the truck will be able to

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,959
participate

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,080
uh in digital services and be part of it

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,599
we need a machine identity

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,360
yeah and we had a look

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,319
at different areas and we found these

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,599
evolutions of machines so we also said

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,720
every machine

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,000
has needs like basic humans

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,280
and once uh we looked and shaping our

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,400
projects uh

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,360
we said we need to look at the base

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,320
what are the basic needs for uh machine

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,240
needs

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
like the physical needs energy

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,120
infrastructure

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,040
computing power and connectivity

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,639
this is already set in every trucks

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,680
of daimler and there is uh one device

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,120
who bring uh the uh capabilities

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,759
uh to connect um uh the truck

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,560
to let's say the the internet and to the

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,720
world

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
and has communication capabilities and

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
computing power

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
the next step was that we said we need

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,639
to bring

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,560
safety into this yeah so that the truck

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,680
can defend himself against uh attacks

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,360
and afterwards we started the social

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,479
belongings and cooperation

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,600
where the business uh model came in

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,120
that we said okay what is now where uh

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,440
task the truck can work do in the future

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,400
with his machine identity and with this

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
ownership

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,280
that the truck can um act

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,360
on behalf of the owner in the future

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
because in the future as i said before

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,639
one of the big topic is autonomous

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,080
driving so

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,560
um there is a trend to reduce

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,000
the drivers or maybe take it out of the

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,800
vehicles itself

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,039
so the truck or the machine needs to

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,840
take over the tasks

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,560
then the level uh the highest level is

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,520
self

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,840
actualization and esteem like for sure

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,160
that

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,400
the machine will have an own reputation

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,479
and attention and maybe cognitive

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,639
capabilities and artificial feelings and

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,120
creativity and can

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,759
design their own routes or trips

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,479
so this is where we thought about can

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,960
you

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:25,160
go to the next screen akash yeah sure

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,919
um and this is how we imagine the v2x

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,120
economy the truck

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,240
itself is more or less connecting to

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,319
different areas

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,199
to different partners one is the

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,400
infrastructure infrastructure is like

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,840
tall station fueling station washing

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
parking which he needs in the daily

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,720
business

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,800
also the grid maybe in the future when

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,720
we talk about electricity

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,319
um they can identify themselves

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,440
and let's say maybe even pay or that

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,840
will pay directly for the needs

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
for sure there is important for

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
autonomous to also

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,199
maybe in the future communicate with

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,720
other vehicles

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,280
for safety reasons and the vehicle to

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,240
cloud

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,960
is normally that there is capability to

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
um

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,840
communicate with other back-end systems

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,639
like the fleet management system

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,680
um where with the freight management

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,080
where the

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,960
tasks and the transportation tasks are

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,240
managed

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,599
and the cost management the sap system

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,720
uh how um that the truck can

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,319
directly let's say send

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:45,840
invoices or receive revenues for

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,840
his services

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,080
so um akash maybe you can go to the next

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,080
slide

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,160
yeah sure

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,080
thanks a lot uh martin for such a

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
wonderful uh introduction like

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,680
where the vehicles are heading and where

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,000
we are

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,080
bringing them together into the world of

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,120
the v2x economy system so

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,599
this is what we think that in future

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,360
vehicles will be self-reliant to manage

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,400
their own profit and

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,280
loss center we do not need

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,479
uh any administrative efforts to expand

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,319
on vehicles to

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,680
make sure that what vehicle is earning

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,120
for a company

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,680
how uh how much it is spending on its uh

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,800
needs like we saw in the evolution of

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,880
machines

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,760
and uh how much it is uh making profit

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,599
so the overall aspect of uh bringing

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,519
such a profit and loss center from an

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,600
oem perspective we have to determine the

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,959
life cycle of a commercial vehicle

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,800
be it a bus be it a long-hauling truck

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,560
be it a medium duty truck or the

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,959
heavy-duty truck

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,000
more or less all are doing the similar

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,560
operations

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,279
and all of them are having the similar

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,720
needs

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,080
so we we did the exploration how this

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,959
life cycle of a commercial

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,360
cycle can be determined and we divided

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,720
the whole life cycle of the vehicle into

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,680
three segments majorly one of them is

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,519
i am just like a human michael also

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,440
needs an identity which is

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,160
irreplaceable irrevocable non-repudiated

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,240
and temper proof and which which is

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,720
coming from the vehicle not

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,920
not coming from any additional device

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,480
which is

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,959
portable to the vehicle and making sure

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,880
that

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,800
vehicle is having an identity though

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,959
those are not the

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,080
things which we are looking into we want

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,600
a vehicle

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,040
to have its own identity which is

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,200
uh which is legally approved

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,160
which is having all the valid uh

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,000
authenticity

00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,279
uh to prove its identity in the market

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,279
to uh various infrastructure be it v2c

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,959
meet v2i v2g or y equal to vehicle but

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,760
it should be capable of and

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,680
more or less the ultimate requirement is

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,519
that it should be secured

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,920
it shouldn't be forced so this is how we

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,200
think

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,040
a vehicle should be identified and

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
uh definitely we will quite into the

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
details of

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
all these three segments in the upcoming

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,519
slide

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,640
but then the second segment what we

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,079
think is

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,040
i live so as a human live for

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
uh and the human is having basic needs

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,600
like the food

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,200
and the energy and um

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,240
maintenance you can say how i maintain

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,000
myself just like that vehicle is also

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,200
having the similar requirements they

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,480
have a requirement of

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,680
uh having the fueling beet energy meter

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,600
hydrogen power cell or be it lng

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,680
or cpg or gasoline anything

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,959
but they have a requirement where they

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,000
spend something

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,160
on themselves which is right now

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,640
coming out of the cost functions where

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,839
and so where someone at the company is

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,720
managing those uh cost and the bills

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,200
together

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,040
but this should be ideally managed if by

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,160
the vehicle itself in the

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,560
autonomous industry and then i work

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,920
definitely uh as i work in a company

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,920
then i earn my

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:33,839
living likewise vikal should be the

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,800
very minute or i would say the sku level

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,200
unit

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,160
in the industry where it uh it

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
identifies

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,600
its own profit at the month end maybe

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,320
i'll

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
walk you through the details of each and

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,399
of

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,399
these segments in the upcoming slide

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,160
so the very first thing like how we

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,880
define a vehicle is

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,519
so currently all the vehicles are

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,360
globally identified by the wind number

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,279
but when we look at the capabilities of

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,040
the wind it is quite static

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,680
and it is a single number

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,920
which is enough to identify the

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,000
uniqueness of the vehicle but when we

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,120
talk about the digital services

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,600
it is not capable to do the

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,800
to prove its identity or to say yeah

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,519
this is me

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,399
so that's where we think that we have to

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,200
have

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
something like economic identifier which

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,880
can be

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,160
a self-sovereign identity of the vehicle

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,839
or decentralized identity of the vehicle

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,519
or a cryptographic identity of the

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,399
vehicle or maybe

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,320
uh identity like win but what are the

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,360
characteristics it should bring

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,120
so the basic characteristic of economic

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,399
identifier where we need

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,839
uh this vehicle is it should be

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,519
able to identify its physical location

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,399
its physical asset what it is

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,480
and what the type of the vehicle is and

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,920
where this identity belongs to

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,320
in particular like which on-board unit

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,360
is having the identity of this cycle or

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,480
is this replaceable or if replaceable

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,639
so making sure this gives a vehicle

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,440
its birth proof and it's um

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,360
so what we think here that uh all the

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,079
blockchain related identities how they

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,160
are uh coming up is they have the

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,120
private key and the public key pair so

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,480
can we have something like hsm in the

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,600
vehicles where

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,199
we keep these private keys and make sure

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,040
that

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,800
these vehicles are able to prove its

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,320
identity by providing the digital

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
signatures on the

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,920
documents which is being provided to

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,160
them and make sure that whatever

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,160
identity is given to them it's a

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
it's intact throughout the life cycle of

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,560
the vehicle

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,160
then the second thing uh which we need

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,839
to enable the vehicles uh

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,639
as in the im segment is the vehicle

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,600
documentation um

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,279
if we look at the vehicle type we get a

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,760
lot of documentation

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,760
from the legals like the registration

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,720
the license plate number

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,240
or as in like we have the owner

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,959
information we have the

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,480
manufacturing information so all this

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,040
information together

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,160
makes sure that vehicle is an illegal

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,279
entity to run on the roads it pays taxes

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,560
and it it can be traced

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,600
back to the owner

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,639
so all those things we have to uh bring

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,800
together

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,880
and we need to see what is the bare

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:46,000
minimum requirement to make

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,000
this vehicle as financial entity in the

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,760
in the traditional let it be the

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,240
traditional financing or

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,880
the banking or the dlt based or the cbdc

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,279
based

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,720
so what is the bare minimum need to make

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,720
sure that the vehicle is

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,720
a legal entity to make the transactions

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,760
and to maintain the bills and the

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
invoices

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,839
so that's where we introduce something

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,600
like

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,120
know your customer so you can say know

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,000
your worker

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,839
which is the utmost requirement then the

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
global certification because

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,760
all the autonomous vehicles are having

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,880
hundreds of softwares

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,800
and all the components which are

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,160
perfectly which are being driven over

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,160
the air updates and

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,519
all these things so this is where we

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,440
have to follow all the

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,120
regulations which are being said by the

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,240
unic or uwta or european reasons or

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,279
any global uh entity where we have to

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,759
comply

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,959
like whether this vehicle which is

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,399
running on the road

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,839
is having a certified software or not

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,959
what is the life of that software

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,880
and then the fourth uh section in this

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,560
im segment is the acquisition and the

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,519
dispose

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,320
as a vehicle i should be completely

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
aware

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,440
that whether i am owned by someone or i

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,759
am being leased by someone

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,120
what is my first life cycle when i'm

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,519
getting sold

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,399
in the resale market who is owning it

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,880
again

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,639
do i have the correct owner information

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,040
do i have the correct financial

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,560
statements available from the bank

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,040
so likewise if we look at the

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,759
consolidation of these four sections in

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
this im

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,440
segment this brings the

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
basic requirement of a vehicle to make

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,920
sure that

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,120
it is almost equal to a living entity

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,440
so that's where uh we uh

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,920
move to the i lift segment where the

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,519
vehicle is mainly

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,320
uh going for like uh what i uh generally

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,800
need

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,079
so what we have seen in the fleet

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,920
operations like

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:57,440
i need uh to i need a fuel i need

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,120
a parking i need a tolling i need to pay

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,240
for the tolls i need to pay for

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,880
washing likewise there are multiple

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,280
services where the vehicle is required

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
to

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,559
pay for something which they are

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,760
consuming

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,520
so um at this point of time how it works

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,880
in the current industry that there is

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,799
someone at the back and

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
back offices managing all these bills

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,679
together doing

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,600
the monthly closing and then paying for

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,120
all the bills which are being provided

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,319
by the service providers to those

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,520
companies

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,840
or something like that but

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,720
what happens in the future when a

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,000
vehicle is

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,360
on the road and whatever it needs it

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,880
should be able to identify itself at the

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,960
service provider

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,799
and then it should be able to consume

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,240
the services which are being provided by

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,400
the service provider

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,080
it should be able to validate all the

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,480
bills together which has been

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,640
given to the vehicle against the

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,200
services consumed and based on this

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,640
intelligent uh

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,640
validation he can make a decision

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,559
whether this will is correct or it

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,720
should be going for the distributed

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,480
if the bill founds correct then it can

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,120
simply signs on it

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,559
and which can further go to uh the

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,360
banking system and

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,559
the overall monthly closing can be done

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,799
based on these

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,640
vehicle side in this way we can also

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,160
eradicate some of the frauds which are

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,360
generally happens at the fuel level

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,559
which are generally happens at the

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,039
odometer level

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,039
in the resale market so all these

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,120
signals that we are getting from the

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,600
telemetry we can get it signed

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,720
and have these bills and the invoices

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,960
getting signed

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,480
we can simply eradicate a lot of

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,280
administrative effort at the back

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,440
offices of the logistic companies

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,240
so this is where we are heading to uh

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,720
where we talk about the eye lift section

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,400
and uh services maintenance definitely

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,760
when there is a certain breakdown

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,520
or when there is a monthly service or

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,520
half yearly service so whether a vehicle

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,160
can maintain its service history what

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,440
are all

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,280
uh components has gone down

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
what was the service period what was the

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,840
warranty period whether it was under the

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,919
warranty period did i pay for something

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,080
which was under the warranty period

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,000
so all these intelligence we want to

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,120
bring under the service and maintenance

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,320
section

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,320
and we also want a vehicle to track its

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,880
life cycle from one owner to another

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,440
owner one location to another location

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,080
one registration to another registration

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,880
so that

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,520
this life cycle uh this vehicle can be

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,400
tracked

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,799
right from the inception right when it

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
coming

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,520
out from the assembly line of the

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,559
manufacturing unit till it gets disposed

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,960
or the scrapped out

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,919
or is scrapped out in the scrapping

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,960
industry

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,919
so this is where we wanted to track

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,280
and find out how much a vehicle has made

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,960
throughout its lifecycle

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,880
and definitely the financial operations

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,840
like if the vehicle is

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,520
leased then is it paying the lease

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,000
values on time whether

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,120
all the financial emis are being paid on

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,280
time or not

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,760
do i have any financial transaction

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,039
spending from the bank side which is

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,159
not paid so these are typical financial

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:19,840
operations as in the live entity

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,559
a vehicle should pursue then we move

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,760
forward to

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,840
uh i work because that's the uh

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
that's the income section where the

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,520
vehicle is going to earn

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,280
until what we have seen the vehicle has

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,240
proven its identity

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,200
then we have seen where the vehicle is

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,039
providing

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,200
where the vehicle is consuming the money

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,640
now we are going to see where the

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,520
vehicle is going to

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,039
get this money from so definitely the

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,360
freight operations and the fleet

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,080
management are the most important uh

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,679
activities here so uh in the freight

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,400
operations like weka should be able to

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,520
determine the

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,120
smart route like if a vehicle is running

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,360
from point a to point b

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,039
what is the shortest route possible and

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,000
where i'm going to consume the lesser

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,360
fuel

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,960
which is vehicle should also be

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,440
able to consider all the weather

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,919
conditions and

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,799
all these things together and the job

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,799
assignments

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,320
vehicle is a vehicle should not be

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,799
standing too much time for at the

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,640
warehouses just in their standing queues

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:27,760
so um because our machines

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,440
were diagnosed it's capable to run 24

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,520
7 it's so heavy and so heavy-duty that

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,440
they do not have any problem even if

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,840
they run for 24-7

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,559
so we should not be wasting time on

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
standing

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,960
or um like

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,120
during this uh all the

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,960
blockages on the roads so vegas should

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,760
be able to make those decisions and

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,880
also like if there is uh as we have seen

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,559
that we are also

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,159
trying for the vehicle platooning so

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,200
which platoon is uh

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,559
most uh useful for me so i

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,880
as a vehicle i should be able to

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,120
take the decision right and then the

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
fleet of fleet management basically uh

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,120
here we want to cut

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
down the driver wages which uh generally

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,440
a company spend

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,880
on a driver on monthly uh basis and then

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,520
or the assurance of

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,919
the driver and as we have seen uh that

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,600
there is a shortage of the drivers even

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,600
especially in japan

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,799
and i think the similar conditions are

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,240
there in

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,480
europe also where we have seen the

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,400
skilled drivers are very less available

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,520
and when the skill drivers are available

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
they are highly

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,360
rigid so how can we

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,600
work out those conditions as well and

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,280
the overall cost management like

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,919
vehicle should be able to interact with

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,039
the erp systems or the cost functions of

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,200
a company

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,679
so that it can produce all the bills

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,760
together and all the invoices

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,720
which it has earned and all the credit

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,440
notes together

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,799
and for the consolidation so that the

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,320
cost management can

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:08,320
take it together and produce the final

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,120
profit and loss statement now uh

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,799
this completes uh the life cycle of a

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,840
vehicle now i would like to

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,280
show you how a self governed commercial

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,960
vehicle looks like

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,679
when it is there on the road so

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,760
here we uh we can see from the bottom

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,320
there is a service provider

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,360
who provides certain services to the

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,919
vehicle

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,559
since vehicle is uh equipped with the

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,400
machine identity vehicle does the

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,440
handshaking with the service provider

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,760
infrastructure vehicle make sure that it

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,000
is

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,279
unknown or it is a valid service

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,760
provider

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,440
and then once the identity confirmation

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,840
is done then the vehicle is

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,440
open for taking the services from that

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,640
service provider

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,679
we can also build the reputation of

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,720
that identity mechanism on top of

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,240
any platform which we want to utilize

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,520
so that the vehicle uh can be rated on

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,080
terms of

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,440
these services and then the once the

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,520
service consumption

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,080
is uh done from the vehicle side

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,080
from the infrastructure side and then

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,120
infrastructure produces

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,080
the invoice and the bill

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,880
to the vehicle vehicle validates the

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,039
invoice

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,159
and the bill and provides the digital

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,279
signature

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,080
by having its own uh private key which

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,360
is a

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,480
part of the integrated hardware

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,559
and once this invoice is signed then

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,600
this signed invoice can be passed on to

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:49,520
the cost management and the erp function

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,400
so uh and the signed invoice can also be

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,279
passed on

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,679
to the service provider which can

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,799
produce at the time at the monthly

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,080
month ending all these signed invoices

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,799
to the career company

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,480
and they can do the payment connecting

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,760
once the payment netting is

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,159
available then it can be adjusted

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,039
against the machine account

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,799
which is where we say that what we have

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,279
seen in the i am part

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,039
now the vehicle is a legal entity and

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,360
it's capable to do its

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,240
know your vehicle processes along with

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
the uh

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,080
as per the banking regulations or the

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,159
financial mandates

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,559
once the vehicle is having its own

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,039
account so all those naked bills

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,400
can be adjusted against the machine

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,279
account

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,400
at the same time cost and erp functions

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,679
can produce the

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,000
monthly closing things uh to the uh

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,919
against the bank account and what we are

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,159
seeing right now this is the trusted

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,520
infrastructure

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,000
so it can be any middle layer which is

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,600
uh

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,080
being regulated by the banking system

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,080
or the decentralized finance system or

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,600
the robonomics part

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,679
where it it adjusted

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,960
the machine account against the

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,080
available balances

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,120
and then provides the uh

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,159
fees to the service provider so

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,919
this is how uh generally uh in the

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,400
logistic industry we pay

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,120
at the end of the month not uh in the

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,640
real time

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,960
but yeah

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
so when we talk about all these things

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,279
the most

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,880
important aspect here since we are

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,400
dealing with the time we are dealing

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,440
with the money we are dealing with the

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,320
vehicle

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,080
which is most important for us and we

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,919
are bringing life to it

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,840
since it is a machine then we need to

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,480
make sure that we

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,880
follow the security standards and what

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,000
we

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,320
as we have coined uh so what we have

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,919
seen in the v2x economy which is

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,240
completely driven by the global

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:58,000
standards of the cyber security

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,919
and uh our solution is well fortified by

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,640
the security controls

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,360
so we are taking the security life cycle

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,559
uh

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,039
basically this devsecops framework

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,760
right from the starting the first line

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,919
of the code

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,200
and making sure that we follow all the

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,240
guidelines

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,880
and avoid all the open

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,080
text services for the product

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,480
development itself

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,840
we are also relying on the public

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,399
infrastructure

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,960
not necessarily it has to be centralized

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,760
but we

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,200
uh we are also checking out some of the

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,039
platforms which are

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,000
providing this public uh key

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,720
infrastructure in the decentralized way

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,039
where we can form a consortium or we can

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,240
go

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,159
open uh source also so that's where

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,480
we bring the digital certificates and

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,080
the signature capabilities

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,520
to the vehicle as for the trusted

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,960
infrastructure

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,360
and uh then this hardware secure module

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,440
definitely it's uh required for the key

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
storage so these are the basic things

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,120
we have to make sure that it is a part

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,159
of the i

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,320
m section of the vehicle and

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,440
there are some standards which we have

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,840
baseline to

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,480
uh bring such solutions to the market

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,520
like

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:19,200
we uh we are following the fifths 1864

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:21,520
and mrp256 and cx09 or x509

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,760
so all these standards which are highly

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,760
important to us which we have baselined

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,640
our solutions to to make sure that the

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,360
systems

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,520
are interoperable and secure enough for

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,480
doing the handshaking with the uh

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,520
known or unknown infrastructure once the

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,520
m2m economy is on the full swing

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,640
so that's the overall perspective that

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,840
we want to bring

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,880
now maybe we can talk about some initial

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,520
applications

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,520
which we have done on this uh machine

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,000
identity platform

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,279
so martin would you like to take it

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,080
forward

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,039
thanks akash for your explanation i

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,440
think uh

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,080
what we are also talking is about to

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
bringing

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,880
the truck uh of coming from the object

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,200
uh who is used

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,320
to being the subject in the future to

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,159
act

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:15,360
um on behalf of somebody um for sure

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,880
in the center there is the id yeah and

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,559
several applications to manage the costs

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,600
and also include the revenues

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,080
um just uh as you know there is the tall

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,679
uh

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,480
a car or a truck can connect to a toll

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,919
station

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,279
and do the payment um we have uh

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,720
payment capabilities we have uh

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,919
um already prototypes where um

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,960
e-money uh is the the

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,840
truck can hold it on the other side

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,799
there is

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,480
also services which are not related

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,279
necessarily to payments but

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,000
it's about exchanging data and enabling

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,200
other

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,600
new business models business models or

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:06,720
other models means for example insurance

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,600
that new that insurances is

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,640
interested in the data of the truck and

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,279
offer

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,679
other uh contracts in the future based

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,799
on

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,320
uh telematic data from the trucks

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,600
same like fuel cards tokenized plastic

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,960
cards

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,240
is the future paper use cases

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,080
by leasing these all

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,840
is open a world of new services

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,399
where the truck can organize and

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,880
orchestrate

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:45,440
with the service provider

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:49,520
so this was i think my

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,720
points so i hope you got a glimpse in

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,159
where the commercial vehicle will head

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,279
in the future and that

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,159
connectivity is one of the keys to

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,399
develop the business of commercial

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,760
vehicles in the future besides

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:11,440
selling only uh the hardware

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,760
right i would also like to mention that

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,039
like

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,000
last year we did a very successful poc

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,320
on this machine identity with the charge

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,200
and

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,600
um with the charging station where we

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,880
use

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,159
these corda framework from the dlt side

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,519
and we in the in this poc

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,200
we had our e-money running in terms of

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,080
tokens

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,880
where we enabled basically uh two

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,840
entities

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,720
vehicle as one of the entity and then

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,760
the charging station has another entity

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,159
we did with the single one but i'm sure

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,600
that the scaling can also be done

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,760
so what we did here uh we enabled

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,919
uh trucks with the machine identity

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,519
which are completely compatible with the

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,799
recorder framework

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,919
and then we did a charging

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,559
in the lab conditions of a vehicle uh

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,840
along with the energy charge station

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,799
framework

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,440
and uh then the vehicle identified how

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:17,200
much charge it has taken how much

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,320
value against the charge it has to

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,039
transfer and out of this digital store

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,679
of value

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,320
vehicle has transferred some value to

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,720
the charging

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,320
station account so this how they have

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,760
done the payment matting

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,200
but then we realized that um

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,240
being a biker to become a node in the

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,320
dlt industry so at this point of time

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,320
it's a difficult task so industry is

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,760
needing the thin clients

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,039
which is uh where the truck can be a

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,399
node itself

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,440
and a machine can become uh

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,640
an entity in the network itself

00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,960
so likewise uh a several

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,840
or uh n number of pocs and the

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,159
activities are possible when we think

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,360
from the perspective of the identity the

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,600
tokenization

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,440
and the dlt frameworks and the

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,279
decentralized frameworks

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,880
and i'm sure that they will come up in

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,720
the future also where we

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,279
are also working together with a lot of

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,480
partners to bring such services to our

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,440
customers

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,240
so yeah so that's uh my explanation from

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,440
the application

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,919
part and i hope that we were able to

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,559
cover

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,840
and live up to your expectations from

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,440
this talk

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,559
and i'm sure that

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,120
you will have a lot of questions so

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,080
we are here throughout the day over the

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,559
chat section

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,519
you can reach out to us in case if you

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,120
miss out

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,039
then we are also available on the

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,120
linkedin where you can

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,519
find us and uh you can reach out to

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,039
us for any open questions we are very

00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,360
happy to answer we are

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:03,760
also very happy to understand your uh

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,679
suggestions like how shall we uh what do

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,519
you think about the solution

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,520
what else would you like to see in such

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,800
solutions and

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,639
what is your perspective with this

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,000
regard so i'm

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,839
we are very open for such a intelligent

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,800
community i would say

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,200
and uh thanks very much uh for having us

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
here

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,000
and listening and giving us your

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,000
precious 50 minutes

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,240
thanks a lot also from my site thanks

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,839
akash thank you

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,839
have a great day thanks
