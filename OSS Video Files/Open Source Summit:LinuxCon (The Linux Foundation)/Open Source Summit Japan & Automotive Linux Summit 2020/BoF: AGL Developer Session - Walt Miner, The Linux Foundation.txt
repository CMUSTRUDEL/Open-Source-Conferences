hello everybody

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,240
uh hopefully uh this is walt miner

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,039
um the hgl community manager

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,720
so if you're familiar with agl you know

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,600
you've probably heard my voice on

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,680
meetings before if not uh welcome to the

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,160
meeting here

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,080
also with me is john simon muller to

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,640
answer questions at the end

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,399
and uh some other folks from the aglo

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
community i can see have joined as well

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,559
who can help answer questions

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,320
um because it turns out that i really

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,680
the development process and i also

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,520

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,080
what is agl well dan already discussed

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,799
this

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,320
earlier this morning or this evening

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,479
we're a collaborative

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,640
linux-based collaborative project based

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,400
hosted at the linux foundation

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,680
um focused on rapid innovation of

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,439
vehicle software

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:43,040
using the agl unified code base and he

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439
dan very nicely explained the origins of

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,240
the

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,040
the term unified code base during his

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,040
keynote session

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:59,439
we have like he said 11 um

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,159
oems who are currently members of agl

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,360
and we will be announcing a 12th in

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,160
january

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,239
um so that's very exciting

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,760
so the 11 that we already have account

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,280

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
of all of the vehicle shipments

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,000
worldwide and you can see

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,680
we have most of the the japanese uh

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,800
vendors the oems

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,120

etc we also have a hyundai in korea

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,560
mercedes-benz in europe ford here in the

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,680

and saic in in germa in china

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,080
we have now a dance slide earlier 160

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,800
members worldwide across the different

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
tier level

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
different membership tiers

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,760
and agl is the the only

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
organization focused on all software in

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,239
the car and as

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,760
as we like to say if if there's a linux

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
running in the car we think it should be

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,959
running

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,760
uh automotive grade linux and that

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,400
covers

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,840
instrument cluster our traditional

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
infotainment systems that we've been

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
focusing on

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,879
moving into telematics and head up

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
displays in

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:26,799
adas we're working with

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,280
the elisa project on adding functional

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,280
safety

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,720
so that's uh what we do

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,360
the unified code base is really focused

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,040
on

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,959
a single having a single software

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,400
platform with

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,680
uh a variety of reference hardware and

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,360
applications available

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,400
for that ref for that single code base

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,120
and our goal has been to provide uh

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
70 of the base platform for production

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,640
projects

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,000
and really since the the start of agl

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,799
um focused a lot on creating

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,560
you know cultivating an ecosystem of of

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,720
develop not just the software but

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,720
developers and suppliers

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,239
and automotive expertise drawing from

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,280
automotive expertise

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,280
all working on this single platform

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,639
and you'll see if you uh if you attend

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,359
our meetings you'll see that there's

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,120
people

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,680
from different tier ones and different

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,840
oems who are actively participating in

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
in all in all parts of the project

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,960
um here's the latest uh

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,520
2020 schedule um we have

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,680
just decided in the last week or two to

do a 9.04 release

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,919
for ice fish um there's one critical

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,639
fix that we want to get in there we have

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,199

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,800
um and we have uh

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
kooky koi i've got some detail more

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
details on these schedules in a couple

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,440
slides here but kooky koi the first

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,320
uh release mile pre-release milestone

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,680
will be

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,680
coming up in the next few weeks

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,600
so jellyfish which we finished in uh

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,479
in september we released in september

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,199
we made the decision to operate to the

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,000
dunfeld branch to yakbo 3.1

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,880
originally we were planning on 3.0 but

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,840
when yakto

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,160
decided to uh announce their long-term

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
support version we decided to jump right

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,800
to that

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,560
which delayed had the effect of delaying

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
the release a little bit but we think it

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,800
was worth it

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,479
um we've now got basically a feature

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,960
equivalent demo

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,320
um with the new window manager and

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,440
compositor

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,039
uh that matches the ces 2020 feature set

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,080
demo set that we we run at ces

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,680
um we did some gap analysis from them

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,360
and uh on on some new features and we're

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,880
trying to drive uh

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,280
we're trying to drive those new features

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,759
in based on gap analysis that was done

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,560
by the

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,560
steering committee

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,319
this is just the schedule that we ended

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,120
up uh

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,880
um working to throughout the year you

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,759
can see we actually did the up rev to

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
zeus

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,160
finished that in march and then made the

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,240
decision upper up to dunfeld

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,759
um so the first patch release

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,800
is now planned actually for uh more like

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,160
um

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,919

getting that

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,360
into kooky koi um instrument cluster

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,000
uh host container system uh host system

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,360
container

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,319
is should be ready for koi

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,639
um the agl compositor window manager

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,919
work should all be complete

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,919

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,919
chromium 79 and making the associated

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,440
web app manager changes that need to be

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,400
done to make that work

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,800
if you saw the vert i o presentation

that in we've got a rules-based

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,319
arbitration system

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,400
for um for the gui going in for a

and we should have the initial reference

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:12,240
hardware

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,800
uh system architecture bsp available

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,960
let's keep doing that so here's the

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,720
schedule for koi we've got a the uh

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,879

and then we'll have the the kooky koi

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,880
patch releases the 11.0 patch releases

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,240
through uh through the uh at least the

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
first three quarters of next year

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,160
our plan right now is to um stick with

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,360
the

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,080

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:26,240
um and then a quick note so we have uh

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,160
expert groups uh in agl

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,720
that focus on a lot of different uh

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,600
areas uh the active expert groups we

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
have right now

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,519
include application framework uh

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,720
connectivity

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,600
continuous integration automated test uh

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,080
virtualization uh reference hardware

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
speech

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,800
vehicle to cloud instrument cluster and

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
the new one that we just announced and

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,360
we'll just be starting up

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,080
uh next week is the product ready ivi

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,880
expert group so that work has been

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,040
started

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,959
within the system architecture team and

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,240
now we're transferring that to this

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,480
expert group which will be led by toyota

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,360
who will have an update on the product

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,279
ready work

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,360
uh tomorrow during the one of the

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,200
sessions tomorrow

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,880
we'll also have a bop session strictly

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,399
dedicated to the instrument cluster

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,560
tomorrow we'll get an update from our

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,640
instrument cluster expert group

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,320
um so you can ask more detailed

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,680
instrument cluster questions then

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
as well as uh today

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,160
and then again i'm going to post these

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,279
slides i don't know if i got them on

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,160
discount already

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,519
but uh our list of uh developer

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,880
resources so

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,399
where to find our documentation um

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,839
there's a getting started guide and the

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
wiki there's another actual getting

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,399
starting guide on the documentation site

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,360
the documentation site just got

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,760
refreshed

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,440
we had a student for the google season

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,200
of docs who just finished up

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
did a really nice job refreshing the

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,399
documentation site

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,600
um wiki pages have all of the

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:06,480
expert group information we we use

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,480
jira for schedule and issue tracking

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:15,120
here's how you can find all the code we

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,000
use a

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,560
garrett instance for code reviews and

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,680
there's a get mirror available

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:28,240
there's also a get lab mirror i believe

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,880
um now that's available i don't have

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,880
that listed

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,120
and we have a weekly developer call on

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
tuesday mornings or tuesday morning

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,320
chicago time

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,040
afternoon in europe evening in in asia

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
we have an irc channel on freenode

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,560
automotive

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,240
and we have a developer community

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,880
mailing list so a lot of different

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,279
ways to get information or ask questions

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,519
about what's going on or try to get help

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,519
um from people in the community

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,279
oh that's last year so last year we had

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,680
a lot of face-to-face workshops we try

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,480
to do something face-to-face about every

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,040
two months uh get developers together in

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,240
a room

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,399
hash out uh any uh

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,079
upcoming road map or architecture or

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,680
design issues

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,600
work on integration you know

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,639
face-to-face hack fests

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,639
for these integration sessions um this

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,600
year of course with covid

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,360
we had to uh cancel some of these and

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
move some of them virtual

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,160
the next virtual face-to-face meeting is

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,519
actually next week

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,440
there's a link here to our wiki page

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,680
where you can

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,639
you can sign up and get the agenda and

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,079
uh

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,880
attend that'll be held on european

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,079
time so in the morning in europe in the

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,800
really wanted to give a

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,279
kind of a quick overview for people um

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,680
and

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,360
open it up for questions uh we have a

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,560
number of people here

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,959
scott is here uh lorenzo can answer any

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,440
questions about web apps

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,480
so uh if there's any questions either

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,839
put them in the chat

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,279
or um i'm supposing you could unmute

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,839
your mic i don't know how that works in

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,839
this system

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,480
so are there any uh are there any

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,880
questions

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,959
that you have for me or for anybody else

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,959
about how agl works or where to find

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
things

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,839
come on someone's gonna have a question

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,320
i know we just had an a um ask the

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,000
expert questions where there were some

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,519
questions answered asked

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,040
so one question i was asked was is agl

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:38,160
iso 26262 compliant um

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,800
the answer is right now no um we are

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,880
um i'll ask your questions through the

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,320
chat tab at the bottom of your screen

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,480
um so uh we are not at the moment

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,279
iso 26262 compliant we are working we

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,880
are now members agl is now a member of

00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,800
the alisa project and embedded linux

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,279
in safety applications and we are we act

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,639
we

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,760
we formed a um automotive working group

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,480
in conjunction with as part of alisa

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,800
and our instrument cluster expert group

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,800
is

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,320
actively working with um

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,160
actively working with the automotive

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
group to

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,600
certify safety certify the instrument

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,519
cluster

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,279
that they're working on with the plan of

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,440
trying to get something that is

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,040
ready for a production system at the end

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,720
of

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,720
next year as soon as possible

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,639
so if you want to join i could put a

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,519
link and i could add a link to the alisa

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,839
project

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,880
in my list of uh my set of links here

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,880
that might be a good idea

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,839
alisa has their own mailing list and

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,839
meetings and minutes and such

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,120
john simon do you want to spend a second

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
to talk about the

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,680
uh continuous integration process that

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,680
we have

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:24,399
yeah can you do that so um

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:28,399
to keep everything uh running and stable

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,240
we have um continuous integration and

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,680
automated testing

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,160
uh workflow in place we host our code in

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,680
garrett so we have a couple of garrett

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,360
repos

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,160
and if there is any change submitted for

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,399
review

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,600
we will do a ci build using jenkins

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,160
and once this is built

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
we will actually go ahead and put the

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
software on

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
onto real boards onto virtual machines

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,839
but

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:04,319
also real boards to test drive it

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:07,520
and run a test suit and give feedback to

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,480
to the developers if

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,480
anything breaks

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:18,400
so that has been developed in the last

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,480
in the last cycles

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,480
and uh we are using

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,400
um how many how many boards do we have

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,400
and how many boards do we have in ci

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,760
these days um it's about

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,919
10 boards uh 10 hardware boards

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,919
um um

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,039
and um five different types times two

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,799
um so we have the renaissance board we

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,400
have the pi

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:54,320
we have the up square the value

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,000
the new ref hardware um

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,440
and um yeah i think that's that's all

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,880
cloud or no sandcloud yes so the big

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,880
bone enhanced as well

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,400
yes

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:29,840
anybody have any questions come on you

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:29,840
gotta have something

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,400
so another question that was asked in

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,080
the ask the expert ask

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,799
the experts sec segment

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,440
a few minutes ago was um if we're in any

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,840
vehicles

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,799
and we are currently in toyota's product

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,840
line

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,480
and subaru announced that we would that

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,600
agl

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,880
would be in the 2021

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,720
model year 2021 products

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
and we should be hearing more from

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:25,840
different manufacturers

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:25,840
in the next year or so

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,080
test yes worked

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,559
okay anybody else have anything it's not

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,840
much of a buff session if nobody asks

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,840
any questions

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,240
i was just thinking about that what are

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,120
the plans to increase board support

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,840
comes from uh i'm gonna say karthik um

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,360
but it could be

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:15,280
uh karthikeyan um

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,640
so we have the concept of um

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,000
reference boards and community boards so

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,400
where we have a member like renaissance

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,520
or

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:30,559
san cloud um we pro we will get the

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,679
uh we'll say official

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,799
support from that vendor to

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,200
get their board into into the

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,240
build system and they will provide

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,520
boards to us

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,640
for the ci so that's where we got the

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,240
the value board for ti

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,159
in the past was a reference board um

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,679
the uh the renaissance uh

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,600
uh arkhar h3 right now and um

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,120
the sandcloud beaglebone enhanced are

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,880
all reference boards

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,640
and then we have boards we have boards

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,159
and qmu which are more

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,120
community supported um so

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,360
uh we are adding imx we have recently

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,120
added imx 8 support

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,960
nxp imx8 support basically if you have a

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,520
if you're if your board vendor has a bsp

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,039
layer

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,320
for yakto then we can that's you know

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,360
dunfell we can easily get it into our ci

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,960
system

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,679
if there's a need to do it um and simon

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
you're the

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,440
you're the expert you and scott are the

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,240
experts in getting these bsps in

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,240
um you have any

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,880
yeah so for for the board support there

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,320
are two

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,600
um two things

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,039
basically we need the uh the

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,080
cpu cycles to build

00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,159
uh the the platform um

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
so for that we need we need some

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,960
sponsoring

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:10,159
and uh if you want to add a

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:13,520
board you can also host a lava lab

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,640
which is basically a remote worker

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:21,200
that connects to our lava server

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:25,679
and uh in that way we can

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,400
push test jobs to that board in question

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,400
so that's an easy way to to give access

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,679
to a development board

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,240
um and let us test on it um

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:41,840
without shipping things around the world

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,840
yeah that's worked pretty well for us

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,919
so um if you had a board you wanted to

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,919
add to the to the

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,159
to the board farm you could add that you

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,320
know we can add that remotely

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,600
i think as someone who's done a few

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,520
boards

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
and maintained a few of the other

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,039
templates for other ones

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,600
so the the big thing uh when i basically

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,640
i mean i guess a couple of requirements

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,080
from the bsp

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,600
are that the kernel the relatively new

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,120
um newer the better for the most part um

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,120
but at this point i think we're

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,520
if you were older than i think 414 you'd

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
probably have to we'd have to resurrect

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,120
some

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,640
patches uh

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,320
that we have uh dropped for older than

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,880
that

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,200
and whale and support would be the other

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,400
one

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,360
because uh you pretty much would want

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,080
the to support whalen and weston that

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,679
are in

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,840
dunfell which is 8.0.0

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,480
um you'd have some work to try and make

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,520
agl work against a bsp that didn't have

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,960
that at this point

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,679
so those are the kind of big ones

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,120
that was the hangout for imx8 actually

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,080
why it didn't go in

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,679
until earlier this year was it was a

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,120
mismatch in the

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:14,400
the driver stack with respect to

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,000
to weston so yeah

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,200
yeah right so with with dunfeld we are

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,200
mostly on 5.4

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:33,840
plus minus on the patch release

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:33,840
number for all the boards

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,039
which you want to be on at this point

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,240
anyways because it has i think

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,520
six years support

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,120
if you uh yeah

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,320
5.4 is is i think gonna be it was super

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,840
long term as i think

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:04,080
greg refers to them so um

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,600
of the currently long-term support at

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,440
that that better out

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,600
5.10 is going to be lts2 but i think 5.4

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,880
probably is the best bet for

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,880
shipping and something that's going to

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,840
be in the market for

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,840
you know plus years for a while right

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,440
unless you're really good with you know

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,240
over-the-air updates and are

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
confident you have a good rolling

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,640
release

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,279
workflow which is i think uh kate's

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,520
discussion

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,640
earlier about elise that was one of the

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,880
recommendations that

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,400
i think they're making is to to try and

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
stay on main line

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,600
so another question from carthakin i

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,000
hope i'm pronouncing that correctly

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,520
um when can we see agl on commercial or

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,720
passenger vehicles so

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,080
just to reiterate we agl is in the um

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,400
toyota and the subaru now um but keep in

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
mind

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,520
we don't expect that the um

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,559
we don't expect that the ui that we ship

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,480
anybody would ship

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,000
these are just demo these are just

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,679
reference and demo

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,360
uh user interfaces the the advantage of

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,640
agl is that any manufacturer can then

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,120
um take that take our base platform and

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,279
build out on top of that whatever

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,159
whatever ui whatever user interface they

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,640
want

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,559
and uh you know we're providing uh you

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,640
know bindings for

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:44,559
uh cute as well as uh html5

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,679
web apps so you can you can basically

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,159
have the look and feel of uh

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,960
you know have whatever look and feel you

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,400
want

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,480
using using agl and you know have your

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,880
branding

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,080
uh have your branding be available

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,720
however you want to do it

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,919
so i would not expect that we would ever

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,960
see the agl

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,080
apps as we show them in our demo to be

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,760
showing up in vehicles

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,760
but the more the back end

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:21,840
more the back end stuff

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,000
you'd probably have to have a qt license

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,520
to actually ship the

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,279
demos in the vehicle yeah

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,640
that would be one one issue that you'd

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,880
have to resolve

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,880
right

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,039
yes thank you um how can i start up so i

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,679
can uh

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,840
i have your contact information from the

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,159
uh

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,480
um uh from the

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,080
the uh conference center we could set up

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,919
a meeting with you to discuss

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,360
uh how you can take advantage of that

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,159
separately

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,120
um dan kaushi and myself can meet with

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,640
you and talk about joining agl

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,640
and how you can leverage that

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,640
so i can say if you can send me an email

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,640
my email address is on the top

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,000
is on the cover page of this or i'll i

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,640
can grab it from our

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,640
from our list

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,840
any other questions

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,960
i want to port my flutter based

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,559
real-time fuel priced app to hdl how do

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,399
i go about this and who can i discuss

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,080
this with

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,679
oh flutter that's an interesting

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,840
question so um

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,720
we know i think there was a uh

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,159
presentation

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,760
at elc europe

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,520
about was it sony

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,960
yeah someone from sony was talking about

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,320
their research effort

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,200
into it yeah it wasn't for automotive

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,200
per se

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,279
but yes so so we do not

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,600
support flutter at this point and of

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,480
course as john simon would say

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,360
patch is welcome if somebody wants to

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,279
port flutter onto agl

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,880
we of course would welcome that into our

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,440
garrett um

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,039
right now we do not have that on our

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,840
roadmap and

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,960
i have heard uh from one of our member

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,240
companies

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,080
some discussion of um them

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,840
porting it and making it available you

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,399
know donating it to agl

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,159
but i i can't really say if or when

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:45,200
that'll really happen

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:47,039
um so um

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,039
it's really hard to talk about a flutter

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,960
right now on agl i mean it's certainly

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,840
something that we would welcome but i

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,960
don't have any concrete plans for that

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,600
bernard

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,559
it's it's viewed as non-trivial let's

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,279
put it that way

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,799
yeah it's very non-trivial the uh

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,320
there's some significant development

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,840
work on someone's part to

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
to make it happen

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,320
however just to mention on top of that

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,880
um

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,240
there's also some possibilities to to to

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,760
bundle

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,919
flatter web apps uh and package them

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,039
and use the web runtime to to to run on

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,120
them uh

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,880
at some point we should be able to

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,440
actually

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,320
get some proof of concept of doing that

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,960
as

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,159
already some apis could be connected

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,600
with existing flutter

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,840
applications if they are bundled uh

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,679
and run into the system but yeah it's

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,799
something that still has to be

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,799
to be proved

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
uh

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,039
okay does anybody else have anything any

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
questions

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,799
i think let's talk to dan kaushi i think

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,840
the uh training group was giving away

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,840
linux foundation

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,200
caps i need to get a linux foundation

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,200
cap for these events

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,760
what do you need walt the cap did you

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,840
see that the training group if you

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,159
if you uh if you signed up you get

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,279
either a linux foundation a

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:55,279
penguin plush or a linux foundation

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:57,919
cap i need a linux foundation cap

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,039
yeah we can have some caps maybe agl on

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,240
it

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,080
ago caps there you go no problem

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,320
we'll get that for the next amm good

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,519
idea it's cold in my it's cold

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,360
in my office i gotta wear a hat

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,880
i gotta wear a hat to hide my long hair

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,960
because i haven't had a haircut in six

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,039
months

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,240
or longer actually much more than six

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,960
months come to think of it

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,960
eight months

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,840
okay anybody else have a question

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:43,840
i'll give you another two-minute stance

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:43,840
to ask a question

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:59,519
i think

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,120
so just to reiterate so that agl is a

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,200
member of at least two other

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,039
we we belong now to at least two other

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,559
uh linux foundation projects that we

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,440
actively participate in

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,000
the alisa project for functional safety

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,279
and the

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,159
octo project where jan simon is on the

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,960
advisory board of the octo project so uh

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,679
and with the elisa project we now have a

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,399
an automotive work group that we started

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,960
um

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,720
in conjunction with alisa to work on

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,039
safety certification

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,039
uh the instrument cluster

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:39,840
and uh i think we were big uh proponents

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,840
of uh um

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,760
the uh automotive uh we're big

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,760
proponents of the i'm sorry the lts

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,279
version that yakto did

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,480
um support for aws iot

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:56,159
alexa on agl so alexa

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,679
what's that i said the answer is yes

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,440
yeah so alexa we have available um

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,120
although the latest i think scott was

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,039
trying to get the latest

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,000
um alexa auto sdk 3.0 we don't have

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,200
working

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,399
well yeah 3.0 we can't

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,399
well is involved because amazon

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,000
themselves have sort of dropped their

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,679
efforts on agl support so 2.3 is the

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,919
latest version that

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,320
has the voice agent in it for agl

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,359
uh but my efforts to get it working so

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,399
far have

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,200
uh hit some snags i'll try and get back

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,359
to that

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,040
soon um i have a sandbox branch and

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,720
a gl garrett that i posted to the

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,720
mailing list about a couple weeks ago if

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,399
someone wants to try it but

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,000
i believe yeah simone and i have

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,599
coordinated he sees the same issue that

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
i see so it's

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,679
involves digging around in the guts of

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,960
the auto sdk to debug

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,480
what's going on so right but

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,200
uh yeah 3.0 we'll have to if we want to

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,280
support it

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,040
we'll have to basically do the voice

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,320
agent uplift ourselves

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,520
so that's uh that's just i think uh

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,520
above my pay great so

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,200
for the uh aws question um i just

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,280
put a link in the chat window

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,160
so if you click on that link it brings

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,800
it to the aws website that shows

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,920
the uh integration with agl basically

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,040
there's a

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,960
section at the bottom with a diagram

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,560
in the vehicle the cloud export group

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,800
has been working on getting some stuff

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,839
into the code base

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,839
the guy's from um

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:48,240
mira but they change names

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:58,560
um got some stuff into into

00:35:48,240 --> 00:36:00,560
into garrett recently

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,480
see now bernard your question that's

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,560
just speaking a different language to me

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,000
um maybe maybe lorenzo could answer

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,760
could could

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,520
that's what lorenzo was talking about

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,440
was that's what i bought compiling it to

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,560
the javascript back end and

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,200
and running it inside the the

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,800
chromium setup that uh lorenzo and his

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,640
team have put together

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,040
right but no one's tried it yet i think

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,079
is what yeah i i was doing

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,400
like a very simple example and and

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,079
like initially it should be possible to

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
have that working with uh

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,320
some some of the more complicated

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,440
components were having some issues we

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,440
are actually working on

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,880
on upgrading the chromium web runtime so

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,880
i was like

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,040
delaying this effort to test with more

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,280
complicated flatter examples but there's

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,720
already some documentation in place

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,640
about flutter on how to compile that

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,920
using just including they were support

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,040
for fluttering

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,960
target and then uh

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,400
some components and some widgets were

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
actually working fine in the

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,440
in the existing web runtime in a year

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,200
but it would be just a matter of getting

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,040
like a more complicated example

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,119
connecting it with specific

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,640
uh the application framework apis and

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,599
and getting that

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:22,079
for some more complex proof of concept

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,000
i mean we we are happy to on trying to

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,000
help on setting this example

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,440
and helping to to have

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
these pieces uh testing

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,000
all together

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,880
so of course bernard you're always

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,079
welcome to engage in galia

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:46,960
yeah there you go yeah

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,960
we are we are happy to to talk about

00:37:48,839 --> 00:38:05,839
that

00:37:50,720 --> 00:38:05,839
okay anybody else have anything today

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,680
uh

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,680
all right going once

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,200
all right well thanks everybody if

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,240
there's nothing else we'll uh we'll wrap

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,520
up the uh

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,800
the buff session here

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:43,440
and i hope to see you down the road
