hello i'm heather meeker

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,039
i'm glad to be speaking to you today on

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,320
the topic of

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,400
from project to profit business models

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
for startups developing open source

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,320
software

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,920
i'm a lawyer in private practice and a

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
venture capitalist

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,360
and in both of those roles i focus on

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,800
helping companies succeed by developing

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,280
open source software my venture fund

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,280
is called open source software capital

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,120
or ossc

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,559
and we invest exclusively in early stage

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,520
startups developing open source software

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,000
my law firm is called o melvinian myers

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,840
and it's an international law firm

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
where i lead the technology licensing

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,480
practice

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,800
i've been working in the area of open

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,000
source software licensing for over 20

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,400
years

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,520
i started as a programmer in the early

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
1980s

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,560
so i've been in the tech business a long

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,400
time

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,680
and i've been working for my entire

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,799
legal career

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,960
in silicon valley i'm speaking to you

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
today from oakland california

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,080
and i've pre-recorded my talk but i want

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,119
to encourage you to follow up with any

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,280
questions that you might have

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,320
i'd like to thank the linux foundation

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,360
for inviting me to speak at open source

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,759
summit japan 2020

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,040
at the end of my talk i will provide

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,360
some information

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,840
on how to get a free electronic copy of

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,040
my book open source for business

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,600
which is now in its third edition that

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,159
book

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,320
is a handbook for engineers business

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
persons and lawyers who want to learn

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,600
more about open source software

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,079
licensing also

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,719
in the long days of this pandemic i have

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,920
recorded and released on youtube

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,319
a series of narrated presentations on

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,280
various open source software licensing

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,959
topics

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
that are aimed at people who are

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,640
interested in using

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,560
open source software in business and

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,920
want to learn about it in bite-sized

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,959
pieces

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,720
now let's get started and let's talk

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,280
about the intersection

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,000
between open source software development

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,000
and business

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,840
when you talk about open source and

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,080
business it's easy to fall into a false

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,440
dichotomy

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,360
is open source a selfless collaboration

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,599
or is it business of course it is both

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,319
some open source projects are labors of

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,200
love and truly selfless gifts to the

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,080
world

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,560
but some of it is also business and that

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
usually happens when developers who love

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,519
open source

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,120
want to combine their passions with

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
their jobs

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,440
in fact most commercial open source

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,319
software businesses grow out of

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,519
non-commercial

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,159
projects hobby projects experimental

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,480
work

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,040
or projects within companies who

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,720
dedicate programmers to do open source

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,560
r d so the line between the two is never

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,879
entirely clear

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,959
but without doubt some projects are

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,360
primarily not for profit

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,680
and some develop into the basis for a

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,680
for-profit business

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,400
this presentation is about some of the

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,920
licensing and legal considerations

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,280
of moving from a project to a product

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,280
and then to profit

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
in fact the last few years have

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,560
demonstrated

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,159
without doubt that open source can be

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,879
big business

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,200
it is also particularly vibrant during

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,080
bad

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,560
economic times and while some of the

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,239
dire economic predictions at the outset

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,239
of the pandemic have not

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:08,239
come to pass our post-pandemic economy

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,879
is certainly unusual and uncertain

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,560
historically lots of great open source

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,879
projects are started when the

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,759
programmers are between jobs

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,359
shoring up their resumes or reassessing

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
their career choices

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,320
all of which happens a lot in times of

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,600
economic upheaval

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,000
one element of good news today is that

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,840
open

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
source development has always been

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,600
geographically dispersed and socially

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
distanced

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:42,479
so it's likely that right now some great

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,400
open source software is being written

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,840
though we may expect bright things in

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,720
the future

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,160
open source is already today an

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,120
important tool for business strategy

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
this index which is called the koski

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
index

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
and that stands for commercial open

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,120
source

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,199
software company index is maintained by

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,880
my partner jj at oss

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,840
capital and it shows the top commercial

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,919
open source businesses and notes their

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,720
business models and the projects that

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,720
they're based on

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,360
here's the koski on a slide now i know

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,440
this is small and hard to see

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,639
but you can take a look and find it

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,720
easily online

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,960
if you search for cossci

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,320
this is maintained as a publicly

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
available google sheets document

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,520
and as you'll see when you can look at

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,479
it better

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,120
it lists the top companies that are

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,320
commercial open source companies

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,800
and it says something about them such as

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,919
notes on their business model and their

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,680
valuation

00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:01,120
and how the valuation was come to also

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,120
when the company was created and when

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,000
the project was created

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,800
this document's very interesting to see

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
how the most

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,360
successful open source companies and

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
some of their characteristics

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
now what is a commercial open source

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,520
company

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,199
it's defined as a company that would not

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,440
exist except

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,960
for the existence of an open source

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,319
project

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,360
for instance red hat is based on linux

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,919
and confluent is based on kafka and

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
though they are very different companies

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,160
they are both commercial

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,440
open source software companies

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
particularly

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,280
in 2018 and 2019

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,960
there were a lot of big exits in the

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,240
open source space

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,360
and what we mean by exits is

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,440
acquisitions and public offerings

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,240
as you can see some of these companies

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,120
have extremely high valuations

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,960
so if you're interested in turning your

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
open source project

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,000
into a company a commercial open source

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,919
software company

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,400
how do you go about it how do you get

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
your company to be successful and get it

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
on this

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,080
list i'm going to talk today

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,440
about three topics that will help you

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,639
get there

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,360
the first is and it's the most important

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,400
one

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,840
to know your business model and with

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,960
your business model you'll have to

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,080
understand your licensing model as well

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,599
the second topic is about branding and

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,880
trademarks

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,360
and the third topic is a grab bag of

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,840
subjects about how to get your project

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,080
ready for prime

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,440
time okay first let's talk about

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,240
business models and licensing models

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,520
we talk about them together because the

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
licensing model

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,080
serves the business model in other words

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,879
you figure out what your business

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
is going to look like and then you use

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
the licenses as

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,440
tools to get you where you want to be

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,440
in terms of your business goals

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,479
the most important lesson for an

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,759
emerging commercial open source

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,800
company is don't be the underpants

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,520
gnomes

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,360
now if you are not a south park fan

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
maybe you haven't seen this but it's

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,080
very funny

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
true lesson about planning the gnomes

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,400
steal

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
people's underpants from bedroom

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,240
cupboards at night

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,039
when they're asked why the gnomes say

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,399
that they have a three-phase plan

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,959
collect underpants is phase one profit

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,360
is phase three but they can't explain

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,200
the second phase in between

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
and of course the whole thing makes no

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,040
sense

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,279
now some open source companies tend to

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,920
fall into this trap

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,680
lots of stars or downloads on github do

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,720
not make a company

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,360
they make a project it might be a great

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
project but to make a company you need a

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,320
product

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,519
and you need people willing to buy it

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,240
for money

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,080
for that you need a business model and

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,360
this is mainly about defining

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,760
what your product is say product i mean

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,360
that in a very broad sense

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,320
a product could be software hardware

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
services really anything you want it to

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,800
be

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,240
but it has to be something people will

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,800
buy or you don't have a business model

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,480
so that's lesson one don't be the

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,640
underpants gnomes

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,680
you need to have a business model or you

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,680
won't have a company

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,680
with commercial open source businesses

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,120
there are a lot of variations

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,279
on open source business models

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,040
most of them are also variations on

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,200
licensing models because

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,959
the licenses are the tools you use to

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,839
build a business

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,519
also a business and licensing model can

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,519
change over time

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,360
what works in the early stages of your

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,200
company may not scale

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,519
and you may need to adapt to your

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,279
circumstances over time

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,200
as you can see there are a lot of

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,279
examples and i'm going to go through

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
each of the major examples

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,760
so you'll get an idea of what these

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,920
business models look like

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,120
but i'd like to say something about them

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,519
overall

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,399
you have to be selling something and

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,399
what you're selling

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,680
is not the open source software by

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,000
definition

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,320
because open source licenses allow

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,920
people to do things free of charge

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
so you have to have something you're

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,200
selling along with

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,040
the open source software now sometimes

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,800
this is referred to in business as a

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,760
razor blades model

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,680
and what that means is that you sell

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,000
people

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,200
the razor blades but you give them the

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,959
razor

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,440
in other words you're giving away

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,240
something in order to sell something

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,240
else

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,600
and this is one of the wonderful things

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,160
about commercial

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,920
open source companies they create a

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,160
great deal of value

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,240
they create a lot more value than they

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,800
capture in their revenue

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
but you have to capture some revenue in

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,120
order to have a company

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,760
so your job figuring out your business

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,640
model

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,800
is to figure out what's your razor and

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,959
what are your razor blades

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,839
in other words what are you giving away

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,440
to the world

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,720
and what are you selling the first model

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
we're going to talk about

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
is the model of maintenance and support

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,240
now this

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,560
is the most familiar model for a

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,959
commercial open source company

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,079
when most people think of this model

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,880
they think of red

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,000
hat but it's probably more accurate to

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,120
say that this model

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
accounts for the most small or the

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,079
newest

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
commercial open source software

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,720
companies

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,279
in this model there is no license model

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,920
other than the open source license

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,480
the commercial open source company

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,800
offers

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,079
maintenance and support services which

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,800
are provided under a services contract

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,480
if you choose this model it may be

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,279
difficult for you to find

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,920
capital any business that relies

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,360
primarily on professional services

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,639
is hard to scale because the cost of its

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,000
main resource

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:29,519
which is people increases as

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,399
service sales increase such a business

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,160
never achieves any meaningful economies

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,839
of scale

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,200
so it works well if you want to

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,720
self-finance or if you don't want to

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,959
scale your business

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,160
for example if you just want your

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,399
business to

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,360
basically provide you with an income

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,120
this model works really well

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
one of the problems with this from a

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
business perspective

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,720
is that there are zero barriers to entry

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,200
for your competitors

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,480
because one of the objectives of open

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,839
source software

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,800
is no vendor lock-in that means anyone

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,760
can work at maintenance and support

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,959
in your business like this your most

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,600
crucial asset is

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,920
people preferably the people who are

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,839
actively involved in maintaining the

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,399
project

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
when i think of red hat i actually think

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,360
of a different model

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,800
i think more about quality control my

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,079
example here is the pet rock now this is

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,880
a joke of course

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,399
it was a big fad for a joke gift in the

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,440
1970s

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,959
and yes it was just a rock with eyes

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,279
glued onto it

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,920
but think about this more carefully

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,160
rocks are free of charge in nature

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,079
but the rocks used for this product were

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,199
round and of a certain size

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,279
in fact a bit of trivia the official pet

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,760
rocks were the smooth stones from

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
mexico's rosarito beach

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,680
and they were packaged up nicely with a

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,320
box and a logo

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,760
they came with an instruction manual

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,279
does that sound a little bit like

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,360
support

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,560
what was actually being sold here was

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,199
quality control

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,160
and brand recognition you weren't buying

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
the rock

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
you were buying the fact that the rock

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,560
was what you expected it to be

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,360
and that's kind of like the businesses

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,480
of

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,680
red hat and other companies that have

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,959
a so-called pure open source model red

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,240
hat of course sells

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,839
linux but it performs a great deal of

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,480
quality control

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
particularly in building and packaging

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,560
in addition

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,440
to support now all of that

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,800
business is executed via a support

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
agreement

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,720
while red hat does not use any

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
proprietary license

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,639
it has a very important piece of

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,079
intellectual property and that

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,320
is its trademark that trademark

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,600
represents the quality control of its

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,600
products

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,639
in fact all commercial open source

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,320
companies need

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,639
trademark protection and brand

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
management and we'll talk about that

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,959
more

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,600
soon but for this kind of model

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,000
quality insurance is actually most of

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
what you

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,880
are selling a customer after all they

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,760
could get the open source software

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,320
anywhere for

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,680
free but they're willing to pay for

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,120
quality control

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,120
and that's very important

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,839
another straightforward model for

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,360
commercial open source software is

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,839
online services in this model

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,759
the company provides a hosted platform

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
for its software

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,800
and while the software is separately

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,160
available under an

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,639
open source license the business enters

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,759
into

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,680
service or software as a service or sas

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,160
agreements in this model the business is

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,000
selling the fact that it knows how to

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,279
deploy the software at scale

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
better than anyone else the examples on

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,320
this slide are github and wordpress

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,079
these are two very different pieces of

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,600
software of course and very different

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,360
companies

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,560
github makes available access to the gpl

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,040
git software and leverages the value of

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,360
a ubiquitous platform

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,680
it's not only a place to manage software

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,240
repositories but functions as a kind of

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,120
a proxy for a social media platform

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,440
too so one of the valuable things about

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,279
it

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,600
is that everybody's on github wordpress

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,680
is the commercial deployment of the gpl

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,079
wordpress software

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,920
its business works because many of its

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,959
users are small businesses or

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,199
individuals

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,360
who don't want to bother to deploy their

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,320
own instance of the famous blogging

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,000
and website development software in fact

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,880
i personally use this for

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,680
my website because although i could set

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,440
up an instance of wordpress for myself

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,199
i would rather have someone else do it

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
for me

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,639
again in this model there are a few

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
barriers to entry

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,240
because anyone can deploy the software

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,959
as a service

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,760
and no open source license will prevent

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
that

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,600
companies like these are successful for

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,959
different reasons

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,120
for example with github it's successful

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
because it has a critical mass of

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
developers

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,039
and it was an early mover in

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,640
the business of providing online

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,000
services using git

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,840
even though there are other companies

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,559
also doing that

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,840
for wordpress it's been successful

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,280
mainly because it

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,080
sells to small and medium businesses

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,600
and individuals who don't want to set up

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,120
the software on their own

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,080
and also because it's leveraging

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,760
the original developer of the software

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,120
who actually owns the commercial

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,200
company as well but anyone can deploy

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,760
the software as a service

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,520
and that no license will prevent that

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,400
resulted in a lot of

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,000
infrastructure development moving to an

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,720
open core model

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,080
a couple of years ago we'll discuss a

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,760
little bit more of that

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,160
soon example of a business model in the

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,880
pure

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,400
services category is professional

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,280
services

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,520
some companies develop custom versions

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,240
of

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,360
open source software for their clients

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
for example

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,880
there are a lot of small development

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,200
shops that do custom

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,480
linux development for embedded software

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,960
deployment

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,679
but again this model has the same

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,440
scalability problems of any professional

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,280
services business

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,720
it mostly depends on its human resources

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,120
and those don't scale into economies of

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,200
scale

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,360
businesses in this category have come

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,360
and gone over the years

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,080
and there aren't very many that are very

00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,160
big mainly because of the scalability

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,039
issues now we move on to the next

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,280
variation which combines open source

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,240
software not with services

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,880
but with hardware this has sometimes

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,720
been called

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:16,480
widget frosting examples of this model

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,640
lie mostly in the iot and embedded space

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,960
for example digium makes voice over ip

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
systems running on the open source

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,760
asterisk

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,200
software and plenty of android

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,440
iot oems make money selling devices

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,120
that run primarily with open source

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,600
software

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,120
as a corollary many hardware

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,039
manufacturers

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,440
lay open linux drivers for their

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,160
peripheral devices but i wouldn't really

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,480
call those

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,919
open source businesses those are

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,960
businesses where

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,440
they're using open source as a tool

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,039
to leverage sales but they're not really

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
commercial open source software

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,880
businesses

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,760
this kind of model where the company

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,840
sells hardware and gives away open

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,039
source

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,640
as almost all hardware businesses

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,520
has low margins because it relies on the

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,360
sale of tangible devices

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,240
it is scalable but its scale will be

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,640
limited

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,240
because the margins on hardware sales

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,120
tend to be lower

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
than the margins on software license

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,200
sales

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,720
tangible devices can achieve significant

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
economies of scale once

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,559
manufacturing reaches an inflection

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,799
point where the cost can be reduced

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,120
in this model there is often no license

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,440
of proprietary ip

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,240
these kinds of companies actually mostly

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,520
rely on

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,159
patent for their main ip protection

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,919
and the patent is on the devices not on

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,799
the software

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,120
the central legal transaction in a model

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:03,840
like this is usually a traditional sales

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,840
agreement rather than a license

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,000
one interesting variation on commercial

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,799
open source software models

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,720
is called the embargo model and it's

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,000
sometimes referred to as

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,559
sell the present free the future

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
in this model software is released to

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,159
paying customers

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,200
under a limited license a proprietary

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,039
license

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,039
often on a beta or pre-release basis

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,120
the software is later released to the

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,919
world as open source

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,159
in this model there are two licenses but

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,240
they're shifted in time

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,280
paying customers get a proprietary

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
license

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,679
usually accompanied by maintenance and

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,520
support and possibly professional

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,679
services as well

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,159
and then everyone gets an open source

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,400
license at a later date

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,919
one company well known for this model is

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
mariadb

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,000
which effectuates its model via a single

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,039
license the business

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,720
source license that license sets a

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,039
conversion date

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,320
on which the software is automatically

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,960
made available

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,240
under a gpl compatible open source

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,559
license

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,840
but most other companies use two

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,159
separate licenses for this kind of model

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,159
this model works particularly well when

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,880
you're selling to oems who want to get

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,679
to market

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,520
quickly with the latest improvements

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,000
they will pay a lot

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,039
for having the software available to

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,360
them before

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,360
anyone else gets a hold of it because

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,159
that means they can launch products

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,080
earlier

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,080
and get a first mover advantage

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,240
the way some people have criticized this

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,360
model saying it's not really open source

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,280
but of course it is once the software is

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,799
released under the open source license

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,280
it's open source

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,039
but what people mean when they say that

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,240
is that the development of the open

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,520
source software doesn't

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,000
take place entirely in the open

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,120
the development is staged in such a

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,159
fashion

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,240
that early testing versions are

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,240
made available only to certain people

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,080
this model is called dual licensing

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,080
or sometimes multi-licensing this model

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,400
is becoming rarer every year

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,240
but it is one of the original commercial

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,200
open source software

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,159
business models it was championed by

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,000
mysql in the 1990s

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,320
on this slide you'll see illustrations

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,640
of two kinds of dual licensing

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,080
they're like identical or fraternal

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,559
twins

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,520
mysql's model was the identical twin

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,919
model

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,039
and it is the classic dual licensing

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,720
model

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,559
in this model the software is made

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,080
available under two licensing

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:57,279
options open source and proprietary

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,919
importantly the software made available

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,600
under each

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,440
is identical in this model it is rare

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,559
for a company to use anything

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,120
other than gpl or maybe a pharaoh gpl

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,880
for its open source license

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,600
this business has sometimes been

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,760
referred to as selling exceptions

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,240
and of course that does not make sense

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,480
for permissive licenses

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,799
no customer needs an exception to a

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,240
permissive license

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,799
this model worked well for mysql because

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,320
in order to use the mysql software in an

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,400
application

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,360
one had to integrate its connector

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,440
libraries with one's application

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,039
distributing the two together would

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,679
violate gpl

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,080
unless the application was also an open

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,559
source

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,000
application so customers who were

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,279
developing applications

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
were willing to buy exceptions of course

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,559
those exceptions

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,080
usually also included maintenance and

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,039
support

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,400
but the sale required both a proprietary

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,559
license and a services agreement

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
over time this model changed from the

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,679
identical twin model to the fraternal

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,960
twin model

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,320
and arguably has been almost entirely

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,159
eclipsed by the open

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,559
core model which we're going to talk

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,200
about soon

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,480
in fact it's probably accurate to say

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,600
this model evolved into open core

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,240
in the fraternal twin model the software

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,480
available

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,400
under the open source license is usually

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,520
called a community edition

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,200
and contains basic features the

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,200
proprietary product

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,559
contains not only the open source

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,679
edition code

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,919
but also more features often those that

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,480
are necessary to deploy the software at

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,919
scale

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,240
or in large enterprises those versions

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,960
are

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,640
appropriately often called enterprise

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,720
editions

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,039
and a license usually includes

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,440
maintenance and support as well

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,440
or perhaps even access to new features

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
before they are released under the open

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,600
source license

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,440
dual license software is usually

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,039
developed and maintained primarily by

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,760
the company alone

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,720
rather than having contributions from

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,720
its community

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,720
now let's talk about the open core model

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,640
the open core model separates the

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,520
software that is in the company's

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,799
product

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,840
into two or more buckets the core

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,600
project is an open source project

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,400
and it is run for the benefit of the

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,440
community and with community

00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,000
participation

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,320
the company usually contributes heavily

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,120
to that development as well

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,200
in fact it's very common for the leader

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,880
of that project to be somebody working

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,440
at the company

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
but the company also develops add-on

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,919
features

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,960
which are only available under

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,600
proprietary licensing terms

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,960
this model uses two different licenses

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,919
one for the open source

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,440
core and one for the proprietary

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,159
elements

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,720
the customer agreement for this model

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,960
usually

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,159
includes support for both of these

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,480
buckets

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,760
but this model can get more complicated

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,080
too

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,880
sometimes there are three or even more

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,600
buckets

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,200
that include open source software source

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,159
available software

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,200
binary only software and software as a

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,039
service

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,640
and of course software as a service

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,600
isn't a license at all

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,440
but a services agreement this model

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,399
however is by far

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,399
the most popular commercial open source

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,399
software business model today

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,279
now i have to explain a little bit about

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,799
source available licensing

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:52,000
in 2018 and 2019

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,679
a number of successful commercial open

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,760
source companies

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,279
as well as some up-and-coming open

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,679
source companies

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,320
started to adjust their licensing to

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,520
roll out

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,240
a new kind of model actually

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,480
most of them were open core models but

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,520
they were using a new kind of license or

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,399
at least

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,720
a kind of license that had a new name

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,360
attached to it

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,399
many of them wanted to keep the source

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
code access

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,480
features of open source in their

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,520
proprietary buckets

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,640
so they had an open core for example and

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,039
proprietary

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,200
upsell modules but they wanted those

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,399
proprietary upsell modules

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,200
to make source code available as opposed

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,799
to being

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,840
binary only licenses

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,200
this was partly in response to a

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,840
perception

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,640
that the cloud services providers were

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,720
quote unquote

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,760
strip mining the value of these

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,080
companies

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,120
by using their software to provide cloud

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,440
services

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,120
and not contributing back to the open

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,679
source project

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,080
these companies wanted to capture more

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,399
of the value that they were giving away

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,039
instead of seeding it to the larger

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,559
cloud services companies

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,960
when these companies look for a

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,000
proprietary license for their non-core

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,799
elements

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,720
they found little to choose from and the

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,720
reason for that is that proprietary

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,320
licensing has historically been

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,559
not standardized at all

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,760
so after seeing many companies go down

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,640
this road

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,919
in 2019 i started a project called

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,080
polyform

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,000
to write some standardized licenses that

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,240
made source code available

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,279
but contained license limitations that

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,320
would allow companies to sell exceptions

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,919
these licenses include a menu of options

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,320
like non-commercial

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,080
free trial small business and

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,320
non-compete

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,080
anyone who wants to use the software for

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,000
a restricted purpose

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,520
has to negotiate for a commercial

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,159
license

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,880
and that ability to sell exceptions is

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,919
what helps

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,480
create the business model these licenses

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,200
are free for anyone to use

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,399
and they're drafted by a team of lawyers

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,399
who peer review them

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,760
so now i'll explain why that's important

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,679
for companies that are deploying an open

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,760
core model

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,600
some of them would like to use an open

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,000
source license for the core and a

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,480
polyform license for its non-core

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,480
elements

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,520
in the slide here you can see an example

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,480
and this is not uncommon of a company

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,080
that has created a core and released it

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,440
under a permissive license

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,720
apache 2.0 and then releases

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,760
its upsell proprietary modules under

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,240
the polyform non-commercial license

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,640
that means that anyone who wants to use

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,200
the add-ons for commercial purposes

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,519
has to go negotiate a license with the

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,240
company

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,080
of course the company also needs a

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
commercial license and services

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,880
agreement

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,240
for anything it's negotiating with

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,080
customers so

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,120
such a company would be using three

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,480
licenses an open source license

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,840
a polyform license and a custom

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,840
negotiated customer

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,559
agreement now i won't get too far into

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,519
the details on this but there are many

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,080
small variations on the open core model

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,120
they come

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,440
in a lot of varieties for some

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,080
the core is relatively big and the

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,039
add-ons are relatively small

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,480
that's represented by the orange for

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,440
example

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,240
this might be a situation where the core

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,559
does some heavy duty processing

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,880
and the upsell elements which are

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,159
relatively smaller

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,919
are glue that allows you to use

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:59,440
that processing within a technology

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:03,440
stack in contrast

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,360
in some the core is smaller

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,039
and the add-ons are bigger and that's

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,559
represented here by

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:12,880
the avocado and for some

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,640
the elements are interspersed that's the

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,919
pomegranate

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,320
in these models the company is giving

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,039
away

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,720
certain elements and certain value and

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,600
that's represented by the core

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,960
that's under the open source license and

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,919
it's trying to recoup

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,360
the value in the upsell elements that

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,279
it's created

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,279
and that it makes available under a

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,679
proprietary license

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,200
or a limited source available license

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,440
like polyform

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,679
so all of the companies that are

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,320
deploying variations like this

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,159
are trying to set the right mix between

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,279
the value they're creating

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,200
and the value they're capturing now you

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,200
saw this slide before

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,640
but i'm showing it to you again because

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,039
now you can see

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,640
why i spent so much time talking about

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,440
open core

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,440
it is the single most popular business

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,679
and licensing model for new

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,799
commercial open source software

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,600
companies

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,760
and you can see on this index that an

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,039
overwhelming majority of the most

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,159
successful companies

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,960
on the index use open core as their

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,880
business model

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,679
now that's not to say that it's the only

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,080
business model available

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,000
but you might consider that it's a good

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,039
model for your company

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,880
if you want to follow the example of

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,880
some of these very successful companies

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,320
now we're going to turn to a new topic

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,519
which is the question

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,399
of branding and from a legal point of

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,559
view

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,600
branding is tied up with trademarks

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,760
for any commercial open source company

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,880
trademarks and branding are some of the

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,039
most important assets of the company

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,320
actually that's true of any company by

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,240
the way

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
but commercial open source software

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,720
companies

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,760
give away a lot of the value in their ip

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,879
in the form of open source software

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,720
however even if you allow others to use

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,760
your software freely

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,000
that doesn't mean they can use your name

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,520
you can think of the trademark right as

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,560
a right to say

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,760
what the software actually is for

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,720
example

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,119
if you develop the project called

00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,879
awesomesoft

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,240
and release it under an open source

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,320
license

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,280
others can use the code however they

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,119
like

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,720
subject only to the requirements of the

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,320
open source license

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,119
but only you can develop a project

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,079
that's called

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,240
awesomesoft in other words if they

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,560
develop their own version

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,280
that's not awesomesoft because you get

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,200
to say what that is

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,320
a lot of commercial open source

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,960
companies

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,160
maintain their own commercial brands

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,240
that are entirely

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,800
separate from the name of the open

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,800
source project that drives them

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,000
this is actually a good business

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,480
practice

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,760
open source projects don't always

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,599
steward their brands

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,200
properly so the best commercial open

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,400
source software companies

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,200
establish their own brand identity in

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,839
addition

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,760
to the name of the project and as you

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,920
can see on this slide

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,680
there are a lot of examples these are

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,480
just some of the examples out there and

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,839
these are all

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,359
very successful companies red hat

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,480
enterprise linux

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,400
is the brand of red hat but fedora

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,960
is the name of the open source project

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,560
that they maintain

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,880
confluent is the name of that company

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,960
but the open source project is called

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,560
kafka and is run by the apache

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,760
foundation

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,800
cloudera is the name of that company

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,320
and the project that it's based on is

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,119
hadoop and github

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,680
is the name of that company but the

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,119
project

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,560
it's based on is get so as you can see

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,560
all of these companies have

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,760
distinguishing brands

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:19,520
for their own products and those brands

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,160
represent their quality control

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,640
now if you're a brand new company it can

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,359
be difficult to establish your own brand

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,079
identity

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,000
separate from the open source project

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,520
but if you think you can do it it is

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,599
definitely worth it

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,520
because at the end of the day you will

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,000
have your own brand and that's going to

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,960
create

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,280
a lot of value in your company

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,240
now there are a few last things to talk

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,359
about

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,000
in the category of getting your project

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,720
ready for prime time to turn it into a

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,960
product

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,760
and into a successful company

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,000
of course there are quite a few legal

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,520
and business concerns to attend to when

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,640
you run a business

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,760
but here are just a few to consider that

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,520
are specific

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,200
to commercial open source software

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,640
companies

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,440
first good documentation is one

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,320
of the features that separates hobby

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,839
projects from professional projects

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,200
put enough effort into your

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,440
documentation to make sure that new

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,160
community members know how to work with

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,760
you

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,079
and with your product next

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,960
plan to involve others outside your

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,520
company in the operation of the project

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,480
yes they should earn their participation

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,800
with effort

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,599
but outside participation is one of the

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,400
elements

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,800
that distinguishes a true community open

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,240
source

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,040
project from a corporate vanity project

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,040
and finally consider governance and

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,280
succession planning

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,119
as it stands today you might be running

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,200
the project on your own

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,280
and that might seem enough for the time

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,680
being but you have to involve

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,800
others in the project so that it has

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,800
continuity

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,880
that's going to be important to your

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,000
customers and all of your community

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,920
members

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,520
in other words you've got to give away a

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,280
little bit of the control

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,839
in order to make a successful project

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,960
now this is a separate topic and it's a

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,280
legal topic

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,960
but it's one you need to deal with early

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,280
in your project

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,040
do you need a contributor license

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,920
agreement or a cla

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,000
for your project i have a video

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,760
available on how to make this decision

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,400
if you want to know more

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,160
the link is in these slides here but you

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,000
can also find this

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,040
among a series of videos on my website

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,880
to make a long analysis short if your

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,680
open source project is being run

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,760
under a permissive license you probably

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,160
don't need a cla

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,880
but if you are executing an open core

00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,119
model

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,119
and running a project under a copy left

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,839
license like gpl

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,760
you will not be able to use any of the

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,680
contributions to that project

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,760
in proprietary elements without a cla

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,720
and no matter what you decide you

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,359
absolutely

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,800
need to make it clear so when someone

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,839
goes to your project

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,800
webpage they should see very clearly

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,520
what the terms are for contributing you

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,800
can't just

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,440
leave it to the github terms of service

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,079
or to implication because that will

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,280
cause you

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,040
problems in your business later on

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,200
most github projects have a

00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,079
contributing.md

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,520
file that tells people what to do when

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,720
they're contributing

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,400
and what contributor terms they're using

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,640
so for example if you're not using a cla

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,760
and you're just using a license in

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,720
equals license

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,000
out approach the contributing file

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,200
should specifically

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,880
say that if you're using a cla

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,040
you're going to need some kind of

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,839
process for people to indicate

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,680
that they agree to the cla terms and

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,400
there are plenty of tools for doing that

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,560
which i'll

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,599
leave to you but the overarching

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,760
point is that it needs to be clear it

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,400
needs to be absolutely clear

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,480
or else later when your company goes

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,319
through a due diligence process in other

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,280
words people reviewing the legal

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,839
position

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,839
of your project and your company they're

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,520
going to find that there's some lack of

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,079
clarity about this

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,640
and they may decide that you need to

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,720
engineer

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,800
out some of the contributions and that

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,800
is not an outcome that you want

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,480
adopt a code of conduct today it is not

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,880
acceptable to manage a professional open

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,200
source

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,760
project in a way that alienates new

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,960
participants or is hostile to particular

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,800
groups

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,119
there are some very good examples out

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,200
there like the mozilla community

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,960
participation guidelines

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,319
and you'll see there's a link to these

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,880
on the slide but they're easy to find

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,760
finally you should adopt a trademark

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,839
policy

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,319
you'll remember that i said that a

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,319
trademark is extremely important to

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,599
a commercial open source software

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,520
business

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,000
a trademark policy will help you

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,720
communicate the rules for others using

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,280
the name of your project particularly in

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,200
their own commercial products

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,599
if you need an example of one of these

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,359
you can find one on my website

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,359
just follow the same instructions for

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,720
getting my book which will appear on the

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,599
last slide

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,200
but adopting a code of conduct and a set

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,000
of trademark guidelines

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,079
will be a marker that your project

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,920
that's being turned into a company

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,839
is professional and understands what

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,839
it's doing

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,200
well that's it for this brief

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,240
presentation i hope it's been helpful to

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,400
you

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,560
if you have further questions please

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,720
don't hesitate to reach out to me i'm

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,480
very easy to reach and you'll see

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:09,119
that my email address is on this slide

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,319
you can also see where to find my blog

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,040
which is about

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,200
