00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
its tools

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,680
yeah first i will talk about uh briefly

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,480
about

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,119
oss compliance and then i will introduce

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,079
some tools i will also do little

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,600
demonstration

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,200
i will also show you know how i use the

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,320
tools to build the system

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,960
in my company finally i would like to

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
explain

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,079
how to enhance the system in the future

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,920
and

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,879
yeah of course uh q and station

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,920
okay let's start so uh open source

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,440
compliance

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,840
uh as you may have noticed i named

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,039
this chapter uh stem from the

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,479
book i introduced after uh so yeah oss

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
comprising enterprise

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,680
so of course the same is still for the

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
session title

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,840
okay let's start with a brief

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,840
explanation

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:29,280
i i can't listen to you ready

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,040
oh uh you know i already uh

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:40,400
now i'm speaking uh does anyone

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:44,240
hear my voice

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
oh okay

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
bye

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,840
mike oh

00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,590
[Music]

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,600
thank you thank you very much uh sorry

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,600
for uh misatani

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,720
uh

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,640
okay so maybe many people now can

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,560
hear my voice okay i would like to

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,800
continue uh

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,040
so as you know uh use oss is essential

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,959
for many

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,959
companies there are many reasons for

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,360
this for instance

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,480
you can use oss that is already

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
completed

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,360
this means you can utilize sophisticated

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
software without having to code from

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,000
scratch

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,760
moreover in recent years rss has become

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
more accessible

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,640
it is even possible to use the

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,840
appropriate oss from the internet

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,480
with just a few lines of additional

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,519
commands there are

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,440
many types for example there are many

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,840
oss database applications

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,680
such as postgres sql mysql calculab etc

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,959
and users can choose from them freely

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,200
with this background it is commonplace

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,640
for companies to include barriers or

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,879
access in their products and services

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,280
it is also commonplace to design through

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,200
oss in many development sites

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,760
thus making orisas mandatory for

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,760
companies

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:31,480
now let's move on to oss compliance

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,799
of course as many of you know rs is not

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,599
unconditionally available this is true

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,720
for

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,599
both personal and company use

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,640
but if you are going to use oss as a

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,720
company

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,879
you have to investigate various

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,920
information more carefully

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,480
for example you need to meticulously

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,799
review

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:58,319
the license there are many oss licenses

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,959
but they all have different obligation

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,200
we need to carefully respect the license

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,319
that rss has

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,439
you need to check the copyright as well

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,920
often it is difficult to find it but

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,680
this doesn't mean that they should be

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,160
ignored

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,079
in addition vulnerability and expert

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,919
controls information are all

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,520
important and needs to be checked

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,960
of course this receipt here just example

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,759
it is difficult to deal with everything

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,440
i would like to insist that user needs

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,479
to review a lot of information about

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
using resins

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,600
let's talk about some are saying a

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,160
little more complicated

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,960
users should consider how to check this

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,240
oss information

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,759
then attacking them especially when a

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,440
company uses a lot of

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,120
rss there is a high possibility that

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,840
important information

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,840
will be missed without a proper strategy

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,479
however if you start to consider

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,960
strategy for oss analysis

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,320
you will not be able to find an easy

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,199
solution

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,400
is there standardized way to do any oss

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,520
compliance

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,880
and whose offer is needed

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,759
at this time oss user may consider using

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,840
this part

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,240
and the tools a lot of things need to be

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:39,039
done for oss compliance

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:42,000
but it's hard to know where to start

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,919
is there a point of arrival in the oss

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,479
compliance

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:51,280
we must be careful as long as we use oss

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,240
open chain provides some important tips

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,720
for your

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,720
oss compliance works

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,240
from here i will briefly discuss about

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,960
chain a project under the amber bladder

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,680
of linux foundation which aims to

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,639
establish

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,199
effective and common utilization of oss

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,440
and oss licenses

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,919
open chain is also working to help

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,800
reduce oss management

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,800
costs and open chain is based on three

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,240
cores

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,400
i will talk about opening a bit more

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
the open specification defines a number

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,160
of requirements

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,240
this requirement are for oss license

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
compliance programs

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
it has undergone several revision and

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,880
2.1

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,000
is now available as the latest version

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,840
it is now included in the iso iec

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,639
database list

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
opencm spec is now becoming more of an

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,840
international standards

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,599
at the end of this chapter let's

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,199
consider

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,800
what strategy we can use to improve oss

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,520
compliance

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,160
for example you may want to hire more

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,880
people to pursue these missions

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,160
it's easy to say but i don't think it's

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,599
something most company can do right away

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
it is also important to share

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,880
information both in and

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,720
out of the company not all program can

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,960
be served immediately

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,639
but you can certainly move forward with

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,800
your mission

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,680
however this alone will not easily

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,240
improve oasis compliance

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,160
it doesn't matter how much information

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,160
only the person in charge flows

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,000
in addition be sure to prepare your

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,240
educational materials

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
education can also lead to oss

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,599
compliance

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,000
fortunately there are already some

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,560
education material in the world

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,199
the origin title of this present station

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,199
as well

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,479
the slide provided open chain are

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,479
available for this

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
and finally i suggest the use of the

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
tool

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,960
i'll talk more about it in the next

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,599
section

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,599
but i think it's one path strategy

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,200
yeah i'd like to show you what you can

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,599
do with the tools

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
many oasis compliance tools have been

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,040
developed in the world today

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,240
and some of them are already in use by

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,959
many companies it is difficult to write

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,680
about all the tools and their effects

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,680
but

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,680
i'd like to introduce some of them

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,480
the third speed of tracking of your oss

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,360
compliance

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,440
works term of the tool do license

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,279
analysis for you

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
this may be typical feature of oss

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,480
compressed tools that many people

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,959
imagine

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,160
some of them take a machine running

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,640
approach

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,959
to license analysis this kind of work is

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,440
not

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,959
write down by people who are accustomed

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,440
to working with the cui

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,600
some of them provide an gui

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
it's also automatically generated

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
document for you to use

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,800
when you share the result of your

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
analysis with your

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,440
customers or your queries

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
it is very useful for those who want to

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
spend

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,399
more times reforging the document

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,279
content rather than

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,279
creating it

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,160
the tool can help you with your

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
compliance tasks

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,440
naturally the use of oss barriers from

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,000
projective projects

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,600
oss licenses have different obligations

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,399
to prove your depending on their uses

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,760
that is companies need to manage not

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,360
only which oss

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,360
are used in this project but also

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,560
how they are used then

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,320
inevitably you need to keep track of

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,720
who has reviewed it some tools

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,440
has also exist to assist with laborers

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,920
this information tends to be scattered

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,160
throughout the company

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,320
this is especially true for larger

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,800
companies

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,920
if the same content is checked over and

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,839
over again

00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,480
by different departments a lot of type

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,720
will be lost in order to avoid that

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
the condition of information is very

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,040
important

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:11,360
and what prayers should we be

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:16,160
useful again now

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,320
i will introduce to what the tool does

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
it's not a bad idea to create your own

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,720
tool

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,000
with this feature however there are

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,600
oss tools out there to assist you

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,040
in your oss compliance work

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,160
it is important to remember that oss

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,880
tools can be used at a low cost

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
you can also share your tool usage now

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,360
have with the

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,560
oss community improving

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,440
oss compliance is not

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,560
just for your company it's for the

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,760
entire supply chain

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,320
therefore you will be able to find

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,639
members to develop or access serial

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,639
suite

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,720
now i would like to introduce some oss

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,040
tools in practice

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,600
first i would like to introduce for

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,040
surgery

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,320
a gps to license oss developed under the

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,040
umbrella of the react foundation users

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,000
can use

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,519
photology to facilitate the detection of

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,560
licenses

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,600
copyright and etc

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,839
process includes many such agents

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,399
and new agents are being developed as

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,760
oss several

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,320
methods for outputting the results of

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,800
the analysis are also provided

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,160
including ability to output the results

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,560
in spd-x formats

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,519
let's demonstrate a little bit more in

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,519
using practice

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,600
this is the start page of the first

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,880
strategy

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,399
uh you can read some

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,760
uh explanation about the philosophy

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:20,160
and what kind of package you can

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,920
analysis you can read from this page

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:28,160
and when you start logging you can

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,200
see the home page so

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,600
so if you want to search a

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:39,680
license in your open source files

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:43,519
you can use some several methods

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,880
in this case i would like to introduce

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,639
upload packages when you upload the

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,320
package to the photo z

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,440
you can select some optional analysis

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,720
so you can check a

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,760
product and open it and select

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,880
analysis for example copyright

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,519
agent eg agent and so

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,399
many many useful analysis agent uh

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,680
exists

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:15,839
in the phosphorous after you set

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:19,519
foster the setting you can upload

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:23,519
while uploading software

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:27,839
you can check how

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,880
many agents are proceed

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,399
like this so

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:38,079
if you update it you can check

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:41,680
progress of search engines

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,720
so back to the browsing page

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,160
so you can find

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,680
but which you already updated

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,639
so now appropriating so

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,920
you can find some license names from the

00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,160
agent

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,199
these cupboards and so

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,800
which files are not includes

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,480
which kind of license you can

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,680
check them for example if the writing

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,800
stamp

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,079
checked what kind of

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,040
files includes that represents in this

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,320
case

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,440
so you can open this and

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:30,320
find the file itself

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:33,759
and context in the copyright notice

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:38,800
or license or emails

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,800
or any kinds of useful information

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,360
so if you back to the um

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,000
top architecture of the file you can get

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,600
the list

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,320
of copyright or email names

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,440
so uh thanks to foster the engines

00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,480
you can check

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,759
almost all email lists in the file

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,360
packages

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,800
after you've reviewed you can make a

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,560
spdx format documents or

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,040
files that is all

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,040
fossils

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,279
and next i would like to introduce sw

00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:28,399
360.

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,519
sw 360 is a web application

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,199
that centralizes information related to

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,880
rss

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,600
which is licensed under epl2 and manages

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,040
oss in units of components such as

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,959
license information

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,800
export control information and

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,360
vulnerabilities

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,399
you can manage information in one places

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,240
especially

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,639
you can get results from the foster z

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,880
centralized management of what oss

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,920
components each project uses

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,199
in addition to the gui operations api

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,520
can be used to facilitate part

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:10,240
registration and to read spdx data

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,559
it also has the ability to create

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,520
license documentation to provide

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,439
to customers in addition to the

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,640
different languages

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,760
english japanese and vietnamese and

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,880
other language can be added if someone

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,039
translated

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,039
the license obligation files

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,520
so i will describe the architecture of

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,880
sw 360

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,440
in more detail the information a project

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,960
has

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,880
is not a component but rather a unit of

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,320
information precisely release

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,600
information

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,120
this is a reasonable way to manage which

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,559
version of oss

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,200
is being used by each project

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,840
since the license of os exchange

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,840
depending on the version

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,520
so i will show the uh screenshot of sw

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,840
360.

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:15,120
so this is the top page of the

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:19,280
sw 360. so

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,480
if you click the flag of the country

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,919
so in this case click the japan

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,600
you can change language so

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:34,799
this means even if you cannot read their

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:38,240
english you can use sw 360.

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:41,600
and after logging sw 360

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,520
you can start from this page

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,960
this page shows what kind of project

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,640
you are included and what

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,320
kind of component you are registered

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,640
so you can check this one at the same

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
time

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,640
so if you clicked the component tabs

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,880
you can list of the component

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,640
information in this case

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,080
i click the browser

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,760
so this is written

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,960
many information such as when created

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,760
or who created and what kind of license

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:29,039
includes this license this oss

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,799
so if you click the license for the link

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:36,799
you can leave the license text like this

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,760
so this sm360

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,840
provides the function import spdx

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,480
information automatically

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:52,960
so it is very easy to download

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:57,200
this kind of information from sw 360.

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,360
and if you check the project information

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,640
it is also some includes some

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,840
information

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,960
for example project name or visibility

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,400
this means who can see this project

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,960
and then create it and project types and

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,400
administrator or ecc states many kinds

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,039
of information you can check

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:23,520
from sw 360 project information

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:27,039
so of course uh some projects use

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,080
a lot of open source software so

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:33,200
from this linked list and project

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,240
buttons you can check what

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,880
projects use wax

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,880
open source software and these versions

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,440
this is our sw 360s so after

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:53,440
i would also introduce some oss tools

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:57,520
the next one is oss levy tools kits

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,760
and this is also open source uh tools

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,919
they still aim to assist with the tasks

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,799
that commonly need to be performed in

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,080
the context of license compliance checks

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,200
so unless there are many six functions

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,400
analyzer downloader scanner and advisor

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,600
evaluator reporter so

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,480
if you use oss review syllabute

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,200
you can get those called related source

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,320
code

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,360
and this kind

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,480
of license and so

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,960
result of your analysis document so any

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,720
kinds

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:40,159
of oss compliance

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:44,720
are helped by oss devious toolkits

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:48,080
and next one is the town this is uh

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,280
mainly used for the container analysis

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,840
so sometimes it is difficult to uh

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:59,280
find package license in the container

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,880
oss includes containers but this

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,240
term supports these tasks when you

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,840
use a scan and this scan

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,480
functions this term use scan cell code

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,000
kits

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,120
mainly uh this is manipulated by the

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,120
commander interface

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,640
and so i add there's an example 360

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,720
antenna

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,799
this is scan artifacts of the project

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,440
and download social dependencies

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,880
and validate source code and licenses

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,520
and make some documents

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:39,120
so this is around the sw 360

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,799
negative open source software so

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,080
uh so if you hope if you want to

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:50,880
uh integrate it uh this one

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:54,320
uh maybe you can use with sw 360.

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,280
and the last one is a scan oasis if you

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,240
are interested

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,120
in snippet scan in the source code you

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,200
can use

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,280
this so this result from the

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,640
open source knowledge database this

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,440
narrative database

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,760
has a lot of source code and this kind

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
of

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,320
information

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,080
okay so next

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,400
i would like to explain utilizing tools

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,400
for open source compliance in enterprise

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,320
so my colleagues and i developed it

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,360
in my company we have integrated several

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,400
oss tools

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,360
and developed them in the company of

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,080
course

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,840
it also includes sw 360 and fossil z

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,159
which i introduced it in the previous

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,039
chapters

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,600
this tool is literally available to

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,960
people

00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,000
in various variety of professions

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,720
engineers are not the only people

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,240
involved

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,120
when companies use oss of course legal

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,960
professional

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,240
may perform oss license checking work

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,919
the same goals for manager and member of

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,720
the quality control department people

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,760
by building a management system that is

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,679
accessible to

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,240
all oss stakeholders in my company

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,919
we can easily see who is doing what to

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,640
do each other

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,000
there is one more important point in

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,640
this system

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,799
the tools for oss compliance are

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,039
consistently

00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:42,400
evolving every day

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,240
new feature added bugs fixed or offshore

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,799
manual created

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,320
we are careful to be among the first to

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,480
adopt them

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,120
i believe that just as oss compliance

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,640
is not something that one company can

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,320
handle alone

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,520
the oss conferences should be enhanced

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,520
with the community

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,360
so now i will explain the system a bit

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,559
more

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,200
it is mainly about user support

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,000
building a system is important of course

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,840
but it's

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,559
pointless if no one can use them system

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,559
and if the user considers the operation

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,480
of the tool to be more complex

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,880
and compliance tasks and we came up with

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,760
some

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,679
user support for example hands-on

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,720
training

00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:43,840
documentation and multi-language support

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,840
i will briefly explain each of them

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,760
the effective thing about hanzo is that

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,559
you can receive immediate user feedback

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,600
users who are new to the go to can

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,720
quickly understand

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,000
where that they will stumble

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,600
if you hold it online you won't get

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,200
direct your response but you can do it

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,840
for large number of people

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,559
at once of course as long as there are

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,559
no network problems

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:21,679
and if you are hands-on with oss tools

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,559
there are some additional advantages you

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,279
can exchange

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,720
ideas with people outside the company on

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,760
what operations were appropriate

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,360
in some cases officials already offer a

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,080
hands-on slides

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,840
you can also hold hands-on session in

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,840
collaboration with the community

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,760
next i would like to talk about

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,960
documentation

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,919
hands-on is an ideal way but users

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,120
cannot always

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,240
participate in it in this case

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,480
the document will guide the user

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,679
this can also be created with the

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
community

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,200
we have published documentation and

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,200
blogs on sw 3d

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,799
and more so i already introduced

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,480
this kind of article uh opening japan

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:21,840
so and some people are feedback

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,840
uh to me it is uh thank you very much

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,200
finally i've talked about

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,559
multilingualization

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,960
english is important for oss compliance

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,600
but english is not always native

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,159
language

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,640
of oss users so

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,080
even if you are not familiar with

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,000
english

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,840
you need to do operate oss compliance

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,399
tasks

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,360
so we have to be working on various

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,919
translation

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,919
activities

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,080
especially i have contributed the

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,120
community by translating

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,120
some documents and developing new opens

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,799
to support a wide language

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,840
of a wide range of languages

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,880
recently we did this development for sw

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,159
360.

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,520
where the sw 360 community member were

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,320
very sincere in

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,279
their response to our code allowing us

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,200
to successfully

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,760
develop multi-language function features

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,760
the member of openchain japan provides

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,279
me with various opinions

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:44,240
when i translate english to japanese

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:47,120
thank you very much

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,159
so the first system we introduced has

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,200
been developed with

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,120
user support with some successes

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,279
the number of users the system has

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,559
increased

00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:02,240
of course but the awareness of oss has

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,880
also improved many

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,360
of my colleagues have begun to care

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,120
about

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,840
oss compliance it can also be said that

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,520
the very existence of such their system

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,320
has changed the mindset

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,320
of users

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,080
and the end of this chapter i release

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,320
what i have done with the community i

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,960
worked with the community to develop

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,960
get hands-on and document and translate

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,840
in next section i will explain how

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,840
i plan to make the system more

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
user-friendly

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,960
from here i will discuss the improvement

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:54,240
of the oss system

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,799
of course new features may be developed

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,440
that's one way on the other hand various

00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,360
oss

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,480
compliance series are released every

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,440
year

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,200
choose them and incorporate what you

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,399
need into the system

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,200
this work needs to be continued

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,520
some communities introduced the latest

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,159
oss management tools

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,960
we improve the quality of the system by

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,440
participating in them

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,200
time communities are open to the people

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,399
of the particular region

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,440
while others are open globally you can

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,440
participate in birth

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,760
i want to explain in detail why you

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,480
should join the community

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,720
the knowledge of open source software

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,440
tools shared by community

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,080
and by the company's community can be

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,080
spread

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,080
throughout the supply chain throughout

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,200
the community

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,640
if affects you even if it is not

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,080
directly related

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,880
to your company as you know

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,200
if a licensed violation occurs the

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,360
entire supply chain is immediately

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,799
contaminated

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,919
that's how closely connected the company

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,480
in supply chain are i'm wondering

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,120
if we can take advantage of this and

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,159
share information about oss tools and

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,159
these usages

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,679
okay and now i want to introduce

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,720
a community of series i participate in

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,200
mainly

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,039
they are similar but i will introduce

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,039
open chain reference during groups

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,159
the group holds online conference on web

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,679
days and anyone around the world is

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,559
welcome to join the group

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,240
as it is held twice a day covering the

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,120
same topic

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,120
we are contemplating how to combine the

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,240
many tools already arrivals

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,799
in the world to achieve a workflow in

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,039
fact

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,880
all the tools presented today were

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,360
discussed here

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,080
consider joining the mailing list if you

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,120
are interested

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,399
in so

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,200
and today i will review some theories

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:29,519
from

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:32,240
this one

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,799
okay finally i will explain about

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,080
sharing

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,880
oss series in my words

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,640
we can have this discussion with the

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,279
community to discuss

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,640
what workflows for oss compliance

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,679
management are good

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,320
and how to achieve them

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:57,840
touch knowhow can be shared to improve

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,840

to improve

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,000
compliance and performance keep open

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,000
change spec

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,720
in mind then also once the theory is in

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
no

00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:02,960
no question okay so today

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,640
after this presentation of course i

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,160
would like to share my

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,160
uh this right

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,480
so if you have a question about this

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,040
right please

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:31,839
send me your email so i will

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:31,839
happy to answer them

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,400
okay thank you for question how first

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,520
surgery and set everything

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:26,880
uh 60 talk to each other

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:30,240
ah yeah so um

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,119
so maybe uh they connect it with their

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,720
api and so if you already have the

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:40,000
phosphorous instance

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:42,560
uh you can um

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,680
you use a connection connecting function

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,960
uh very easily

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,880
uh from the gui uh

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,400
so also the maker uh hash

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,920
for the api and so if you input

00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:09,839
sw 360 you can

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:09,839
use the connect to photology and sw 360.

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,839
okay

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,400
so in monitor so uh

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:42,079
so in my case if i uh

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,359
thank you for the answer yeah so so if i

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:49,520
uh okay so if you attach

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:51,839
some source codes are into the sw 360

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,839
you can

00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:00,640
sense phosphorus directly by using ipr

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,520
and then foster the user can

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,839
analysis the license or any kind of

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
information

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,599
from the source code and after

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:16,760
uh if foster the user

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:33,839
sets the status to the closed

00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:33,839
captioning not available

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:47,839
okay any other question

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,320
how do you do a speed option in

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,040
compliance process

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,040
yeah so

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,680
so good question uh so

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,960
in a halfway over to realize

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,000
uh this one so uh so

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,920
at first uh yeah i hope

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,000
uh this kind of documentation

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,359
for i hope uh experience documentation

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,320
uh using a speedex documentation on my

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,560
tasks

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,320
and of course includes the open source

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,079
compliance process

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,079
so but uh

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,810
i tried to do so but uh

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,040
it was difficult so now i

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:44,800
[Applause]

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,160
plan to uh explain

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,040
how to use what is pdx at first

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,640
so because then we set the open source

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,720
compliance processing

00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:00,400
company so

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,839
no so we need to care a lot of

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:07,040
uh information so

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,480
include this pdx but

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:14,000
so uh sometimes uh

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,560
people uh better know spdx but

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,160
sometimes uh don't wear spdx

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,839
documentation now

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,560
so i think spdx compliance

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,319
and aesthetic documentation and the

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,319
compliance process

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:34,079
is a very uh

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:37,560
good uh combination

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:41,599
and so if i use the

00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:45,359
360 sw 360

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:49,520
import this pdx information and the

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:52,880
photography is also same so

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,160
not divide specific way

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,760
but i try to build this

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:07,839
with sw 360 and

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,839
foster z and other tools

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:18,000
so this means so if i set the compliance

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,000
process with the series

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,960
if series already supported spdx

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,400
documentation

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,599
user automatically needed to care expedx

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:35,839
documentations

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:35,839
in open complex processes

00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:08,319
[Laughter]

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:13,200
yeah so we are in the middle stage too

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:16,240
so but i think uh

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,520
if we continue to improve this one

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,839
we can establish because

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,040
now opponent specification whereas pdx

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,079
are

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,079
become a very global standard so

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:36,000
a lot of people uh hope to do so and

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,000
so recently uh

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:44,160
my colleagues uh changed their mind uh

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:48,640
so i think um it is

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:51,710
difficult but we can realize

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,849
or utilize pdx and related tools

00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,849
[Music]

00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,839
finally

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:27,839
and see its rocks

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:23,839
the questions

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:56,720
okay i would like to close this session

00:44:52,319 --> 00:45:00,079
so if you have a question uh please

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,200
send me a mail okay and so if i like the

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,040
slack is also okay

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,839
so i would like to answer the whole

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,839
question

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,839
