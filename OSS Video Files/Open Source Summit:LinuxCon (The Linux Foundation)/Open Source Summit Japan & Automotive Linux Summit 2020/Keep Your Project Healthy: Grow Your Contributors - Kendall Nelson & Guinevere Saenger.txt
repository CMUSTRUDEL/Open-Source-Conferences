hello and thank you for coming

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,719

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,360
contributors

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,000
i am kendall nelson i have been working

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,279
in the openstack community for about

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
five years now

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,760
in a variety of roles everything from

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,800
the technical committee vice chair

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,080
to the release management team i've

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,360
spent a lot of time

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,320
working on developing our onboarding

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
programs and tooling so i've spent a lot

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,680
of time developing the upstream

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,360
institute program that we have and our

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,440
contributor guide

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,440
i'm also involved in the women of

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,840
openstack which has evolved into the

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,719
diversity and inclusion working group

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,039
and other than openstack i have been

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,440
involved in the kubernetes community for

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,920
a little over a year now in sig cloud

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,800
provider specifically provider openstack

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,359
and also sig contributor experience

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,840
aside from working upstream and the

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,880
world

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,560
of open source i love to travel which

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
obviously is not happening a lot right

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,520
now

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,000
i love photography harry potter and

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,000
doctor who

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,159
hey everyone um my name is gwenevere

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,840
uh i have been a combinators contributor

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
since

00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,200
2017. my main credentials are

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,400
that i have led a kubernetes release

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,560
and um more to the topic of this talk

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
i'm the project owner one of the project

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,079
owners um for the kubernetes new

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,520
contributor workshop

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,280
um as a second career techie i'm super

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,280
passionate about making

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
open source contribution possible for

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,920
people from

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,640
all walks of life so um as a result

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,560
i will yell at you to document all the

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,360
things as if you've never heard of git

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,399
before

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,880
because you know what some really senior

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,240
people

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,320
in tech have never used it i love

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
sharing knowledge in the form of pair

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
programming

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,640
and other things a lot of my favorite

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,959
command line tricks

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,760
are things i've picked up from pair

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,120
programming

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,879
or shoulder surfing with someone um

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,239
i love food i love the outdoors owls are

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,640
my favorite animals

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,520
you can find me on github by my profile

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,680
picture which

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,680
does in fact have an owl in it

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,640
so without further ado welcome to open

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,560
source high tea

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,319
we are here to talk about community

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,959
building um

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,760
this talk won't be about getting all of

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,879
your questions

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,280
answered it's really more about

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,360
figuring out how to ask yourselves the

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
right kinds of questions that are

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,760
appropriate

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,959
for your community to go with the tea

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,159
party theme

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,879
when you invite friends over for a hot

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,680
beverage

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,720
and tasty baked goods you have lots of

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
decisions to make

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,680
right and especially right now we are

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,159
all just so eagerly planning that next

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,519
physical get-together um i'm sure you

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,080
have lots of ideas

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,360
what will you serve who is invited how

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,599
many people are you in

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,000
inviting so take all these thoughts and

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,640
planning and ideas because in the same

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,400
way you have key questions to answer

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,400
about your open source community

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,360
um so when you host high tea you want

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,239
everyone to have a good time and

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,280
leave looking forward to the next party

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,760
you need to think about

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,480
sending out invites and planning your

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
features

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,760
i mean baked goods uh

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,959
you need to know how many people to play

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
plan for so

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,159
you'll maybe want to host a bigger party

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,040
next time

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,480
or get together more often um who will

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,840
help you with organizing

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,879
and decorating i i mean documenting

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,040
uh who pays for the event supplies

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,799
what kind of space is your party held at

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,159
do you need to rent a building or get a

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,519
permit for the park cookout shelter

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,280
um in open source all of these are good

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,239
questions to ask yourself

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,239
about your community

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,759
let's start by thinking about project

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
health

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
this is related to what you want your

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,880
community to look like

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,040
so how do you set the table how are you

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,280
organized what kind of governance

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,960
structures does your community have

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,759
or need or aspire to what kind of guests

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,520
do you want

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,280
do you need writers do you need

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,759
community organizers

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
of course we'll want technological

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,680
contributors who write

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,479
code do we need people who are

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,840
specialists

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,440
at devops or testing and so on and so

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,560
forth

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,520
furthermore what are you serving what

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
are your communities

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,440
offerings what features what

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,680
technologies what processes

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,720
are you developing and making available

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,560
to the public at large

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
what do you want to talk about in your

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
community

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,479
do you use email do you use a chat

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,080
instance of some kind

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,280
um do you have regular meetings are

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,840
they do they include video um do you

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,880
have

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,039
agendas do you take notes um

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,160
is there a dress code you know do you

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,000
expect everyone

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,960
to have uh agreed to a certain code of

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
conduct

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,360
or have a license agreement signed

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,280
um and also this is

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,280
kind of brings us into the next thought

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,680
which is a little bit less comfortable

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,639
how do you discover and address conflict

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,639
in your community

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,840
so that's a lot of things just to plan a

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
party right how do you get some real

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,600
numbers here

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,919
so first one thing you need to realize

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
is that unfortunately it's easier to

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,720
measure things that don't work

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,520
than things that do work and there are

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,520
of course two types of things to measure

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,560
the quantitative assessment of your

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
community

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,400
and the qualitative assessment of your

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,840
community

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,960
how many lines of code do you see

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,000
and how you know effective are those

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
lines of code

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,919
for a basic example um if you do want to

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,639
try to measure things that work well

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,919
there are some kinds of surveys that you

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,360
can devise

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,600
um that might get you closer to uh

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,479
to good answers on the positive aspects

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,479
of your community

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
so some things we can measure i

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,639
mentioned already um

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,080
contributor numbers people who want to

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
hear about your technologies

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,599
and use them people who want to build

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,520
extensions to your project

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,199
people who want to use your project in a

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,479
number of ways that you didn't

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,520
anticipate

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,400
um you can hear about these projects at

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,479
conferences

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,479
and workshops um

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
you know you'll find out what they do

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,599
and how many people are doing it

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,479
um then you can always measure lines of

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,599
code

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,639
frequency of releases new features and

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,759
bugs

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,520
security issues and security fixes how

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,880
quick is the turnaround on all of these

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,599
things

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
how quick is the turnaround on a filed

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,280
bug

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,919
or a code change request these stats may

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,240
tell you

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,960
whether you have code review or capacity

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,360
for incoming changes

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,479
you can also measure adoption numbers

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,880
depending on

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,319
which code sharing tool you use how many

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,520
people have starred

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,080
or forked or cloned your project on

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,440
your code hosting platform are these

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,000
users contributing back

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,240
upstream or are they off using their own

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,240
fork forever and ever

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
how many questions do you see on stack

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,039
overflow

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,120
are they getting answered in a way that

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,160
helps people

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
quickly slowly thoroughly

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,560
this kind of gets back into the

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:15,759
turnaround on code changes

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,599
um so another thing that you can think

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,240
about is how long do contributors stay

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,960
active

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,639
right um do people really only show up

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,680
for this one thing and then

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
leave again um do they stay around and

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,639
give

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
back those are things you can look into

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,599
as well

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,880
however that kind of gets us into the

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,680
next uh

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,839
into the next issue where the fact is

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,320
that numbers are not the only way to

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,440
measure health a lot of these statistics

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,839
are valuable

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
but large numbers of contributors don't

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
necessarily reflect

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,399
the quality of their output or the

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:55,760
frequency of their contribution

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:59,360
and so forth

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,720
so some of the things i mentioned in the

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,640
previous slide

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,240
kind of leak into the qualitative

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,440
statistics around

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
your project's health um so my first

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,000
point on this

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,120
slide is psychological safety and really

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,080
that's almost the only point here

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,279
the other ones are just variations on

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,560
that point

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,800
right the basic question here is how

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
accessible is your project to

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
contributors

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,040
regardless of level of technical

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,160
expertise

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,399
and again technical expertise that might

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,720
mean a number of different things

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,240
tech is a huge field people might be

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,959
experts in things that have

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,080
nothing to do with your project so they

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,920
might learn quickly

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,480
if you help them out some examples of

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,320
project accessibility include

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
how quickly can a new contributor get

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,640
started on fixing a bug

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,800
how quick is the turnaround on that

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,519
issue or that bug

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,240
how do people resolve disagreements both

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,760
technical

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,680
and personal um how many resources do

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,320
you dedicate to documentation

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:14,000
do you have writers paid writers

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
um do you need them

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,240
hint you do yes you do

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,040
general uh at large accessibility

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,880
for example do your events have sign

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
language interpreters

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
how do screen readers respond to your

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,000
documentation

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
do your document do your docs exist in

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,920
other languages

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,839
uh do you have events only in your

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,560
country or elsewhere

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,120
um that kind of gets to the next point

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,800
can you

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
support your maintainers your

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,279
maintainers really need that

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,720
psychological safety that includes

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,839
time off time to work on a thing

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,839
rest resources

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,560
understanding that your contributors

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,640
have jobs that may or may not align with

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,640
your project

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,120
understand that contributors might need

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,200
to take time off

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,320
for reasons that are completely

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,000
unrelated to your project

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,519
so you can measure some of these things

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,519
by watching and responding to

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
contributor statistics

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,079
but for others you might have to just

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,000
resolve to talking to people directly

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,519
to having surveys on contributor

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,240
satisfaction

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,839
and similar measures so

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
we've kind of gone over all of these

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,920
questions that you have to ask yourself

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,600
uh and then we have this other difficult

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,000
question on top of it

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,240
uh as we've just established by going

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,920
through how impossible it is to measure

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
things because you can't compare apples

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,519
to oranges

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,320
and not everything is quantitative every

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,040
community

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,760
is very different and not being able to

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
compare them

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,680
means it's hard to set a clear

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,279
definition of what a healthy community

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
looks like because everybody has a

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,360
different definition

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,560
of health so you can kind of start

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
thinking about the answer to this

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,560
question by

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,519
establishing what is different

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,200
so you can't compare one community to

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,160
another because there are so

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
many different things you have different

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,440
internal structures

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,480
the code layout and the people that

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,639
review and merge it

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,320
are going to be different there are

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,040
different tools from community to

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,240
community

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,360
in the openstack community we use a tool

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,959
called garrett

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,000
for merging and reviewing code where

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,639
the kubernetes community uses github we

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,200
have zuul in the openstack community for

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,480
our ci cd and gating system versus

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,360
prow in the kubernetes community

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,639
each community has different goals you

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
might be working

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
more focused on container technologies

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
versus virtual machines

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,399
or something completely different it

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,639
might be databases or or

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
a number of things there are open source

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,200
projects on just about everything these

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,079
days

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
there are different schedules for the

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,600
project

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,480
different release cadences event

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,959
schedules

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,120
election schedules all of that changes

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,839
how a community functions

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,800
and how healthy it is as well you have

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,800
different stages

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,800
in their life cycles also a newer

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
project might be more focused on like

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,800
getting all of the new features and

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,399
growing as rapidly as they can

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
where ones that have been around for a

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,079
little bit longer might be

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
more feature complete and are focused on

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,600
stability and maintenance

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,399
but just because it's not the new shiny

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,040
thing doesn't mean that it's not healthy

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,600
each difference uh makes a community

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,519
unique

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,040
just as each tea party is different

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,480
because of those who are hosting

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,480
the people that are attending the

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,560
different kinds of tea you're drinking

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,240
and i for one have enjoyed just about

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,959
every tea party i've ever been to

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,480
um well there are a lot of different

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,279
things about every community there are

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,839
definitely

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,480
a lot of basics that each community

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,480
should

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,600
or you know hopefully has thought about

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,920
um so you have like a code of conduct

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,360
it might be implied or it might actually

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,480
be something written out

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,920
and um backed by a foundation uh the

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,720
governing process

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
so some uh open source projects have

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,160
committees

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,279
and working groups others have special

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,279
interest groups

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,600
and then along with your elections there

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,160
might be individual project leads

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,000
or lists of maintainers there's some

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,040
sort of oversight

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,040
somehow and it's very different from

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,399
project to project

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,279
foundations also um more options

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,279
uh there are a lot of more options for

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,760
foundations than just the cncf

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,040
there's like the eclipse foundation the

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,920
openstack foundation

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,600
the mozilla foundation and it's totally

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
okay if your project isn't actually

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,120
hosted

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,320
at a foundation either like doesn't

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
matter one way or the other

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,519
it might be a better fit for you to be

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,160
on your own

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,279
or at one of these foundations but you

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,800
should have a reason

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,440
why you are in that situation and why

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,360
that is the best for your community

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
there is probably also a mission

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,920
statement some purpose for

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,560
everybody working together and existing

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,639
um

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,240
you should think about like what is the

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,040
goal that you're trying to achieve and

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,959
not just be

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
going in a thousand directions at once

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,680
that's going to cause a lot of trouble

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,720
down the road

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,079
um so thinking about what is the goal

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
what are we trying to accomplish

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,360
together

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,399
there's also a community culture

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,480
probably

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,240
uh hopefully you're going to be more

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,320
welcoming but sometimes

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,759
smaller uh communities are a little bit

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,560
more closed off because they're all

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,440
focused on

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,600
something that they're trying to

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,639
accomplish together and they don't have

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,560
time to

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,759
ramp up new people but if you're trying

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,880
to grow your community

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,800
hopefully you're welcoming um and

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
how does one join that's another part of

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,600
community culture

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,199
it is um very different from community

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,040
to community sometimes there are really

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,240
good documentation on

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
everything you need to know to get

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,759
started and sometimes you just need to

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,480
go in and introduce yourself

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,519
and find a buddy to help you get up to

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,839
speed

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,600
every high tea or tea party is gonna

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,720
have something different to drink

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,199
probably some delectable baked good each

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
one

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,040
will probably have uh people obviously

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,680
you don't want to be drinking tea alone

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
and

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,199
there's going to be some sort of theme

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,040
so there are always basics

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,320
across every tea party that you need to

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,320
consider similar to

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,040
how there are basics of every community

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,959
so um now that we've spent all this time

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
defining how impossible it is to

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,240
actually

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,800
quantitatively define if a community is

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,040
healthy

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,120
and what healthy looks like let's talk

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,600
about growth

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,880
growth happens on all the levels from a

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,959
single contributor

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,560
to the foundation that it hopefully

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,279
exists at but maybe not

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,639
um and sponsor companies also that are

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,959
involved

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,160
a tea party or high tea is affected by

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,799
everyone involved

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,400
you want people to rsvp you need to know

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,839
what time your caterers are going to

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,199
show up if you have them

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,199
you need to know that you have a

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,720
contract signed with the location

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,400
that you're going to be having your tea

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,439
party at

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,480
so on an individual level you

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,039
might first ask what can i do

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,720
well consider that there are things both

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,120
external that actively

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,839
and directly address issues in your

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,240
community

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,440
and create solutions and then there are

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,640
other things that

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,120
you may need to set like mindset

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,520
um that happen internally that affect

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,799
others indirectly

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,200
so the world outside your head

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,320
you can directly affect other people in

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,039
concrete ways

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,799
things like mentoring is pretty

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,960
self-explanatory hopefully

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,840
your your project has mentoring but

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
sometimes

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,679
you don't have the resources and that's

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,400
okay too there are other things that you

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,480
can do

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,559
directly to help others and that's

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,400
recognizing signs of burnout

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,600
and reach out to them make sure that

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,440
they're doing okay

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,280
see if there's anything you can take off

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,160
their plate without overloading your own

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,919
because that's always a concern

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:19,120
documentation is very important as

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,840
gwen has mentioned a couple times now

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,559
so document everything you do and if

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
it's not

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,679
already documented or if there is

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,320
documentation

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,320
make it better it can always get better

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,400
everything from the processes to

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,840
actually contribute code to how to

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,640
interact with the software

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,200
in terms of usability everything helps

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,799
docs

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,080
always need more love uh thank others

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,960
for their work

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,720
uh i know i love being thanked and i

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,200
know i love thanking other people

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,000
i feel good when i give other people's

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
compliments

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,840
and they may end up giving you a

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
compliment in return

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,320
you can always fill someone's teacup and

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,039
you can serve them at the table from

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,840
a menu or have them select goodies from

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,600
a buffet

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,200
there are lots of things you can do to

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,120
directly make

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,039
sure all of your attendees are having a

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,080
good time

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,679
um mindset as i mentioned a little bit

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,960
uh the things inside your head um

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,320
things that you think about uh often

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
uh do affect others whether it's direct

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,280
or not

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,640
as we talked about on the previous slide

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,120
so um

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,840
recognizing signs of burnout in yourself

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,320
obviously

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,760
it's not completely a responsibility it

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,840
does really help to have other people

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,760
looking out for you

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,520
but knowing that you can say no to

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,880
things when you're feeling overwhelmed

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,280
i often have a to-do list miles long

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,960
and sometimes i need to just say no i

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,039
don't have time to add more things to

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,559
that list or making sure people know

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
that it's going to be a while before i

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,440
can get to whatever

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,919
work item open source requires an open

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,919
mind

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,799
one that is flexible and kind being

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,919
flexible and kind enables you to

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,840
understand how

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,000
you interact with other people better be

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,240
more empathetic

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,080
this along with being proactive saves

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,320
you from more pain later

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,760
at a tea party you can be polite and

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,600
welcoming or you can be

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,960
a bad host that maybe woke up on the

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,360
wrong side of the bed

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,240
you can talk to your attendees and smile

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,320
or you can

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,679
go sip your tea in the corner and only

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,000
talk to one person

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:34,799
that would not be a really gracious host

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,320
so what can a community do

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,360
um yeah so

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,600
we have talked about the individual's

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,960
responsibilities

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,559
um but some of this is

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,000
really falls more into the realm of it

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,960
takes a village

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,159
so as a community there are some things

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,600
that are possible

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,159
to help each other out so um consider

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,880
having

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,679
a dedicated process for tracking and

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,320
monitoring

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,919
measurable project health statistics

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,440
some communities do have entire

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,640
governance structures

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,240
formed around contributor experiences so

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,000
what i mean by that is um establish

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,760
really strong onboarding and peer

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,960
mentoring processes

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,320
so make it easy for long-standing

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,720
community members

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,159
to mentor newer ones what you don't want

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,840
to get into a situation

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:31,120
of um that all your top maintainers

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,720
are so busy maintaining the code that

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,600
they cannot

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,880
share their knowledge right because when

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,799
you give them the time and the

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,840
opportunity to share their knowledge

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,760
ultimately that creates more people

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,559
with more knowledge and frees up

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,559
everyone's time

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,240
in in a company structure

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,159
right a healthy team has a variety of

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,840
experience levels

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,440
and senior staff are encouraged and

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,159
expected and rewarded

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,240
for mentoring junior staff so in an open

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,360
source environment the community has to

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,360
make this possible

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,200
so one of the things

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,440
to lowering the barriers for this

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,880
happening it's a two-pronged approach

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,080
make it possible for your maintainers to

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,159
mentor others and make it possible for

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,240
newcomers to easily find mentors

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,760
just as a side note here make sure that

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,880
disagreements are heard

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,120
and resolved so listen to complaints

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,400
and definitely protect your contributors

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,480
from bad behavior

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,559
because it does happen and it can

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,720
seriously harm your project

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,440
i can think of several examples right

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,120
off the top of my head

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,880
um but back to

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,240
you know back to community organizing

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,120
ensure that you have great starting

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,120
documentation

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,640
as part of your community give a

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,000
centralized place to get started

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,240
contributing

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,080
onboarding classes and workshops are

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,000
another tool that you can use

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,559
make them free to attend make them

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,600
accessible to as many folks as possible

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:13,600
that is maybe encourage scholarships

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,640
for attendance or you know

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,720
uh make this event available virtually

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,440
or make this event available in multiple

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,360
locations around the world

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,559
develop peer mentoring and establish a

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,559
culture of collaboration

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,720
in order to bring about a culture of

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,280
collaboration you must be approachable

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,000
that can mean any number of things so

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,000
really the most

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,320
important thing is that you communicate

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,440
really well what's expected

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,159
um firmly establish the way that your

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,600
community

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,640
communicates moderate the communication

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,559
also look for blind spots challenges

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,440
that you might never experience

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,279
but others might this is again where i'm

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,679
gonna ask you to sit a little bit with

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:03,120
an uncomfortable thought

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,840
do only outgoing loud white people get

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,159
to make the decisions

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,360
i'm not saying you must be warm fuzzy

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,360
and full of emoji

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,840
to succeed as a community although i

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,760
have my personal preferences

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,559
there are open source communities where

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,840
you only ever get to know someone's

00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:23,039
community-specific online handle

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,720
and that's fine what's important is that

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,320
you must let people know the proper

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,200
etiquette

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,320
um reiterating some really specific

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,039
points

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,960
consider language barriers consider time

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,480
zones when you are creating meetings

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,400
it is really not fun to live in new

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,000
zealand and have to get up at 2am for

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,320
all the meetings

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,240
consider cultural barriers which might

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,480
prevent people from speaking up

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,919
or objecting in certain ways when there

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,640
are disagreements

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,400
um for yourself consider that you might

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,600
have internalized racism

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,039
or and or misogyny going on this is a

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,080
thing we can all work on

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,120
i do not exclude myself from this

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,120
and you know realize that people have

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,200
different personalities

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,000
some people are more shy some people are

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
more outgoing

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,360
but the community can't do this alone

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,799
there are some community driven

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,559
incentives that will attract

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,919
contributors

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:25,440
um you may hand out party favors

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,120
to your tea party guests so for example

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,520
i still cherish my kubernetes

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,400
contributor patch

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,880
if your tea party is important enough in

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,960
town

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,480
people will be excited just to be on the

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,559
guest list

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,880
um your open source tea party could also

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,320
be a path for early career folks to make

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,919
connections and write their first lines

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,919
of code or learn a new skill

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,720
but again that's not enough for any of

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,799
this to work you need people

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,200
and their time and their expertise

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,360
so this is where sponsor companies come

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,840
in they bring experts to the project

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,520
if you are a sponsor company you need to

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,279
make sure that your employees

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,760
open source work is prioritized

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,840
appropriately

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,760
do not ask your employees to do open

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,279
source work on top of their internal

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,360
real job duties they're both real work

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,520
if you don't consider this they'll get

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,320
burned out and your internal project

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,400
suffers

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,440
uh your open source tools that you rely

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,559
on suffer

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,000
and your employee may not be able to

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,760
work for you

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,520
for months or even leave altogether

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,279
another thing you can consider is giving

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,279
money to foundations which may have a

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,840
better overview of where the project

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,840
needs help

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,240
so with this we kind of go into what can

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,799
foundations do

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,600
because growth happens at all the levels

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,320
so

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,960
um some of the things that they can do

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,600
are

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,240
like payment if uh the foundation

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,159
actually

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,360
has enough sponsors this might be

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,679
something that they can do

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,400
or they can employ people directly to

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,600
work on

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,159
the software project um

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,799
they recognize the the bigger picture

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,240
and help

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,919
um be a non-biased third party uh

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,000
when mediating between different

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,279
companies um

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,039
different things that they're trying to

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,480
drive within the community

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:25,679
they can help provide marketing uh

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,000
promoting new releases that come out

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,440
they can focus on removing barriers

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,799
being the home of that

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,799
code of conduct that we mentioned

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,360
earlier and

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,679
this is all very very important because

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,399
you need some non-biased third party

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,480
to help balance everything and keep the

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,080
community healthy

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,480
hopefully we've given you a lot to think

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,480
about today i know it's not exactly

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,760
a concrete list of actions like some of

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,919
you may have wanted

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,840
but every community is different and

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,799
health is a very very hard thing to

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,720
measure

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,840
you can make progress and throw an

00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,840
awesome high tea

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,279
tea party experience if you keep those

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,080
things in mind

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,960
uh no one person should be responsible

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,760
for everything

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,399
growth happens on all the levels but in

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,720
the end

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,600
we're all in this together we succeed

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
together

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,880
and communities are beautiful but

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,880
sometimes fragile

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,480
so we need to protect them and grow them

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:28,000
as a community

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:28,000
