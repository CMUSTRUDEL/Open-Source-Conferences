00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,159
a tsugaru shamisen artist

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,120
that shamisen is a three-string

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,720
banjo-like instrument

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:28,159
and the artist's name is um pretty

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,440
uh known in the tsugaru shamisen world

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,120
named agatsuma hiromitsu and we

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,000
collaborated with him

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,480
in a concert in san francisco like in a

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,480

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,600

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,840
and also a little bit of japanese uh

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,840
