okay

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,000
okay hi folks this is uh walt miner here

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,520
i'm the

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,359
agl community manager

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
uh just gonna give people another minute

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,439
here to finish joining

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,760
the session but welcome to our

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,640
automotive grade linux instrument

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,680
cluster

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,000
birds of a feather session so uh

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,920
the instrument cluster expert group hat

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,879
was formed

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,879
almost two years ago it's being led by

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,079
suzuki motor company he had the he and

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,199
the team have been working

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,719
on putting together a uh we'll say a

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,520
production ready version

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,600
of the instrument cluster that they can

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,680
bring to production fairly quickly

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
and so we'll start off uh there's a

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,000
number of uh slides we want to present

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,520
here

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,240
let me start off by uh introducing uh

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,040
hiraki-san from uh from suzuki motors

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,119
company

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,320
and he'll uh he'll present the first set

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,320
of slides here

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,479
and as we go through the slides there'll

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,439
be plenty of opportunities

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,200
for everybody to ask questions as we as

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,040
we go along here so

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,799
um rocky sign take it away

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,320
okay thank you vote uh i'm hierarchy

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,799
uh so uh i'd like to

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,040
introduce uh briefly instrumentals like

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,000
spot group overview

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
so please next

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,320
so this is the introduction uh

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
overview of the uh instrument cluster eg

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
it's called

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,620
icyc so it uh

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,719
started from

00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,799
[Music]

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:05,119
2019 uh apple

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,399
so uh as what mentioned there or

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:13,520
already two years we lock for the

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,520
this uh expert group and

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,879
see you next

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,520
so easy uh member

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,440
you can see the oem member at

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:34,800
toyota honda matra and suzuki

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,800
other members of panasonic concentrate

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,080
so now we are already waiting for our

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
new member

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,879
uh to join if you are interested to

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,760
our expert group please uh

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,760
contact me who is next

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,080
so applying the ager to a cluster

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,879
so it shall achieve the functional

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,000
safety

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,239
that cannot be avoided like in

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
many system clusters are required to

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,959
comply

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,480
with sov target functions such as the

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,239
territories

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,879
and buzzers vary depending on the oem

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,879
but application to functional safety is

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,159
necessary

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,159
to lead next

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:36,159
however at the present condition

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,280
it is difficult to layer the srb by ago

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,319
arrow therefore it is

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,000
separated into sub and

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,400
qm agl becomes qm

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
and the safety mechanism for the slb

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,200
implementation is

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,360
installed outside agio

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,920
a company have the various safety

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,519
mechanisms that can be realized

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,480
for example by a hypervisor or another

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,480
microprocessor

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,040
so it works on code creation-based

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,880
architecture

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,440
a performance requirement to hold a mass

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,680
production requirement specification

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
difference hardware and the difference

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,160
design

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,120
as a reference hardware uh running this

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
algorithm we used under defense design

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
will be used

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,160
to create software that achieves a

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,880
target performance in order to the

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
utilize

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
azure for the production it is necessary

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
to set

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,120
satisfy the same quality and

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,479
performance as a current mass product

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,360
must market product and we believe that

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,520
we can achieve it through the asia

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
ecosystem

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,840
please

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,360
so i see easy aim to complete the source

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,120
code

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,039
of the idea this manager sound system

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,479
first of all and other

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,520
others so our target is next april

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,560
or may so

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:25,840
this is a brief introduction of the

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,840
icd activity and overview

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
thank you

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,680
great thank you hiraki-san does anybody

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,680
anybody have any questions about that uh

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
overview that haraki-san just gave

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,840
if not we go to the next section

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,360
okay as i took the next section

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,400
for so

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,360
and next three section i share the

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,199
is a big issue for the instrument across

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,560
the expert group

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,319
so uh currently ev

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,880
defines three big issues so

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
first is how to create azure instrument

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,240
cluster

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,680
so this means so we don't have existing

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,120
linux based architecture and

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:39,680
we should create a linux based artist

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,680
it's a past a big issue

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,800
next issue is a how to qualify azure

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,680
software stack

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
so uh existing agile distribution and

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,560
don't

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
have a quality management rule similar

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,800
to existing

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,840
linux distribution so

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,000
we should create a coordinate method

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:05,360
it's a second big issue this third issue

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,240
is a collaboration work so

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,280
because we can't discuss how to realize

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,520
function safety

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,919
with asia committee only so

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,400
this means so we should be collaborate

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,639
as a community

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,639
so

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:31,840
at first we shared

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
how to create a agency cluster arctic

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,880
so uh this uh thread

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,800
shows a function block assignment for

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,879
the instrument cluster and

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,879
i've ibra combination systems

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,919
so this system

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,479
uh dividing the safety and real time

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,440
function

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:02,240
on the air cluster ibios or under other

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,240
main functions

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,319
so cluster container

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,520
has a cluster main functions so i

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,680
such as a speed meter a tachometer

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:21,840
at the temperature under any

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:26,560
functions under a area container

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:31,280
it has a radio audio and a

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,159
functions so this software stock

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,760
isolated by the linux container

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,159
technology

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,839
so previously previously talking about

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,959
their levels and the army beast is a

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,720
display sharing mechanism intel

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,000
with a continent so

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,240
it's our main function

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,640
side architecture and the another side

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,680
is a real-time site

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
currently and

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,279
real time and i safety function start is

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,320
not working inside a

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,360
instrumental cluster is we

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,480
define the architecture only so

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,040
this side i have a safety monitoring

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,040
mechanism

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,880
this safety monitor is uh

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,680
realized until the uh territory hiv

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,680
certifications

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,800
and the uh another is a real-time

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,080
functions

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,440
this function too difficult to

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,959
theorize as a new

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,959
daniel linux

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,160
this side only a real-time functions

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
main function is inside a cluster

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,480
container it's

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,130
our overview of the

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,519
overview of the architecture

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,839
[Music]

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
so next next is a

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,800
communication mechanism so

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,000
[Music]

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:19,360
this uh surround shows the icon

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,560
and this means in the communications

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,480
so icon is a response

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,839
responsible for the vehicle signal

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,839
handling which

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:34,399
transferred from mcu this site

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:38,160
and this example

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,440
shows a account message handling

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,680
so a global canvas a directory connected

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,200
to

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,079
a machine site so msc

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,880
side and receive the cam message as a

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,160
transfer

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,800
to the associate main function site

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,839
and this communication mechanism is

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
icicle

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,560
uh this

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:09,040
icicle mechanism which will develop

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040
inside the uh it's metacrystallized but

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,800
so upper side so i see a

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:22,959
i have a intercontinental mechanism

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,079
and we call a boy exercise

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,320
same as a boyex can

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
so

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,480
each application once each service with

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,480
a

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,279
a mission site it's a iso com

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,800
architecture now

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,880
this example is a speedometer example

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:10,079
so hey a microcontroller

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,079
receives a speed from count canvas

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:30,320
transportable transport area so it have

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:35,360
uh it's assigned to a port

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:38,639
100 to 123 to account misses

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,800
so this mechanism are using a ic com

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,920
circuit

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,120
it's a our example of

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,839
a conversation so

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,920
next is a window management

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,399
so multiple containers

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,120
they are sharing shall be done by

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:03,120
introducing dmd manager

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,079
uh there is a manager is at this

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
so a gpu rendering and the composition

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,200
shall be done in

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,560
application container and not a

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,839
container hose

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,240
and this side

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,440
hr application container to render

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,639
directories of the

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,839
device and this

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,160
airline so uh

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,560
it ensure other container can still

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,800
displace the hmi via western

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,279
and each arrow both type of the

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,680
container to render to the dlm device in

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,680
partner

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:45,839
it's a basic window management mechanism

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,839
so it's a example of the use case

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,839
so one of them

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,240
systems so and i'll be a container and

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,720
sent to a tampon information

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,279
using the intel container communication

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,279
mechanism

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:31,839
not available

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,800
another type of this

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,279
display sharing mechanism so and this

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,720
type

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,839
is a hardware composition mechanism so

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,880
i'll be a container i have a

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,240
one deal a display and

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,600
one a battery display

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,760
and the cluster container i have a one

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,560
real display so this resource is sharing

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,639
a visa idea this manager

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,360
and i will continue

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,360
drawing the

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,320
cluster side information

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:31,839
display examples at this

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,839
so classes are drawing the

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,639
cluster user interface examples

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,120
at this so

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,839
finally so a hardware how they are

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,440
composed

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,720
a composite by the two image final

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:55,839
output is that this it's a

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,839
another type of article

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:13,199
uh we have

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,240
we already discussed another part of the

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,440
attraction

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:23,040
such as input management

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:26,639
and asl management and anymore so

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,040
if uh everyone uh

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,199
thanks to airplane i say you think too

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,839
interesting hey please join to say

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,759
our community sng

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,759
so

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,160
what i can can i can we start the iq on

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,480
the

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
face

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:54,320
absolutely go ahead

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,920
so um if there's any questions um please

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,199
put them in the uh

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,560
chat section or in the q a section of

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,240
the uh

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:08,480
of the session so uh

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:12,079
so basically so uh please send by the uh

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,480
zoom chat so uh there is a question are

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,839
all

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,839
uh icom mechanisms subject to acell

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
design

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,760
so currently uh

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,400
open source development and not a

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,080
[Music]

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,600
subject is not adopted actual design

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:39,280
and only a qm design so

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,280
because it's only a

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,440
communication mechanism for the linux

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,480
site

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,799
so i appreciate i back to the s

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,799
right

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,160
so

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:02,960
my our approach

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,320
uh safety monitor and the uh

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,760
operating system uh have to uh

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,880
satisfy the uh sr

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,200
issue that's a another uh

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:21,600
point so

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:24,799
typically not need to satisfy the

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,039
acid if if

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:32,320
it's isolated by a safety mode

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,960
so current our open source side approach

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,280
is

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,280
not

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:43,840
will not satisfy the issue in the

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,840
ic mechanism

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,880
[Music]

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
are there any other questions please

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:11,840
enter them in the in the chat window

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,840
in the chat box

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:39,840
my side

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,840
you want to go is there another section

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,840
i don't remember

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,280
so okay

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:21,840
we migrate the next topic

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,840
yeah so let's do that

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,799
next topic is uh how to qualify agile

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,799
software stack

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,159
so this talk uh how to begin

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,320
so we want to create workflow

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
from open source development to the

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,400
product

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,400
product development

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,799
so this means we want to be able to

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,039
certify that it has a quality control

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,039
so

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,480
industry so a trust and a certified

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,880
agent committee dude

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,559
it's only a clean world so

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,320
asian committee and uh certifies the

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:16,880
existing courses as for example the uh

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,600
as you see on the

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,640
and another existing voices it's a

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,640
highly using case

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:31,840
and the monitoring and the certified

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:35,360
to the agile development voices

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,360
and the agile committee

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,280
assembled to each of

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,880
open source software into azure

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,159
instrument cluster distribution it's a

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,440
approach so industry

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,159
trust and certified this distribution

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,600
and the indus industry can currently use

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,960
this

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,000
distribution so it's a

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,280
our approach

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,280
and our goal

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,919
so i share the current edge reach

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,400
so uh i need an engine instrument

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,400
cluster and development process

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,520
so ibi and cluster are different in

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:31,600
term of the requirement or

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:35,120
in ibs side maybe typically a liquid

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,799
is an innovative and a quickly

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,200
apocalypse

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,760
on the other hand and so close aside a

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,440
decorative

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,520
code quality and the software quality

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,240
at first so many automotive industries

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,440
are using

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,080
famous sources in infotainment system so

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,559
this means

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,200
a part of the existing oss development

00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,520
process

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,240
is already accepted by the automotive

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,000
industry

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,559
in inhotenment system quality

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,559
requirement

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,000
such as we already use a linux kernel

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:16,320
answer algebra c under open ssl

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:21,760
under general dlp and etc

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,760
this means already accepted

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,240
automotive industry use only limited

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,600
doses

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,039
in instrument cluster system so

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,440
this means existing oss development

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,880
process is not much in instrument

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,880
cluster quality requirement

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:48,400
so this

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,760
slide shows uh adapt to the

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:57,520
spice a boy model with

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,520
a asia current adults

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,720
so it's past defining the

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:09,440
sweet to a sw6

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:13,120
by the software development it does

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,840
understand that so currently a

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,880
requirement spec is only partially in

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,440
the

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,440
infotainment

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,320
is uh so good so uh such as a zl0

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,720
it's a however if you do and the

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,919
automated

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,480
test tested testing infrastructure is so

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,480
currently

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,400
is a body

00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,640
so this slide shows a

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:03,760
instrument cluster group a final goal

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,039
to the each elder or

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,000
define the work so

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,840
a first step is i requirement spec for

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,520
the soft test

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:21,120
because i it's only a proton requirement

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,120
not a not a product requirement

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,480
and i need to a development dude

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,120
and defines a change request and this

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,600
means

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,559
why i need to change this uh voice

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,760
version it's a

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:39,039
one of those examples and a

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,039
software stack documents

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,679
so and another phase is a need to a

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,679
design rule and a documentary rule and

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,360
the coding rule

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:54,320
and the ether and the

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,760
most most important point so the

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,679
existing

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,679
ossd using strategy

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,720
it's a very important point for

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,720
our approach

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:16,080
so uh more detail we already

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,120
described the uh edger uh

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,640
conference so

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,400
if you think fine please check these

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,600
documents so and today i share the

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,600
url on the uh

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,200
all topics so

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,039
so one of the development app process a

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,320
draft

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,440
currently we discuss we

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,559
completely completing a fast

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,559
draft description

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,559
next step we start a trial development

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,679
using based on that this air process

00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:01,440
not only a section 2 only

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:07,840
if using fine please check it

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,840
so another point is a document and

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,559
yeah defines a criteria

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,360
first is architecture criteria of the

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,399
using

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,080
existing voices so this

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:27,840
document so how to access the

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,120
existing voices for example we check

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,320
a code quality using the cran

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,320
static understood

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,919
design document

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,600
it's a overview of our work

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,600
for the quality management

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,520
we're starting

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:18,480
[Music]

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,880
this is here in the past q and a

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
sessions

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:31,840
please as question

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,840
using the chat

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,120
when we go to the uh the next section

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,520
yamaguchi-san

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,520
okay

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,520
so final topic is a collaboration

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,200
with another community

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,440
so uh automotive grade

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,960
linux and already joined the editor

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,760
committee

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,799
and each instrument cluster member

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,080
company

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:35,120
already joined the elisa project

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,279
so currently so

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,320
asia member worked with

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:46,399
aj automotive working group

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:54,399
so this topic

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:57,279
shares this work

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,279
sorry please wait

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,080
sorry so uh

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,200
this ratios are asia and it is a

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,320
collaboration

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,360
so currently asia

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,159
has a demo instrument cluster software

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,080
stack

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:24,000
based on rbs of testing

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,120
so currently so it is a community

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,120
creating the uh

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:35,840
asian instrument cluster extension

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:39,760
for example uh extend this by the

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:42,960
uh functions by the asia demo

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:46,240
instrument cluster and the

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,120
another another software is a safety

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,880
monitor

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:55,120
it's a current uh current

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,320
current ad under developing so

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,080
it is a community already created a

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:05,919
meta elisa layer so because so asia

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,960
using the yokt built systems

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,480
so either side creating the

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:16,799
additional layer for the

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,799
azir software

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,960
so currently it is aside and starting

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,480
the development

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,480
of the meta eraser

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:32,000
so so

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,279
this meta eraser can check the uh errors

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,399
at the top

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,399
your raiser url is this

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:46,159
so this method here having the

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,640
additional function adding the a

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,320
functional safety demo to the latest

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,760
asia releases

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,960
uh currently jellyfish and

00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,840
it will be adding a functional safety

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,840
stack to lightest agilities

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:12,080
so this that's all for the

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,080
areas of collaboration topics

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:29,840
so have a question or

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:29,840
comment for the collaboration topic

00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,960
no so finally so we can

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:05,039
answer to a overall question

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,480
so if everyone i

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:13,120

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,480
so the instrument cluster meetings uh

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,119
expert groups meet

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,640
