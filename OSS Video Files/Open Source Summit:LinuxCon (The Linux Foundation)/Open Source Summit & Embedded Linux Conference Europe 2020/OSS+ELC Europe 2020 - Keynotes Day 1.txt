00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,799
you know today

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,680
uh i decided that i instead of giving a

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,240
keynote on

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,960
open source trends and so forth i'd give

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,200
everybody an

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,240
update on what's going on at the linux

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
foundation

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
and what's important to us and what we

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,560
think is important for people to keep in

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
mind

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,280
during an incredibly difficult time

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,920
you know 2020 has been a

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,040
really difficult year for all of us the

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
pandemic

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,040
here in napa california just a few

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,560
minutes from where i'm

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,399
sitting devastating wildfires a result

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,719
of climate change have

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,439
really impacted the area in a horrible

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,520
way

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,960
the entire west coast of the united

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,959
states suffered four

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,280
weeks from uh wildfire smoke and

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,040
difficulties caused from that in the

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,760
united states we're seeing

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,879
social unrest it's just been an

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,239
incredibly

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,959
painful and difficult year but in that

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,120
year

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,560
i'm proud that the linux foundation and

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,280
the open source community

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
more broadly have steeled themselves and

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
have really done

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,080
an amazing job continuing the great work

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
that

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,519
we all do and helping where we can

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,280
in the pandemic you know the linux

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,319
foundation has been up to a lot this

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,040
year

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,160
we host over 400 industry defining

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,640
projects across

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,400
all major industry sectors these are the

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,400
most impactful

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,599
software development efforts in the

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,720
history of

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,760
technology if you think about it the

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
linux kernel

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,959
runs the vast majority of the world's

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,280
computing systems

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,080
our yakdo project is the de facto

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
standard

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
for embedded systems and custom linux

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,640
distributions

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,760
our cloud native computing foundation is

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
the epicenter

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,599
of a transformation towards a cloud

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,800
native development

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,000
modality for modern applications

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,400
our networking project is a project

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,080
where the source code is used to run the

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,560
vast majority of the world's

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,720
telecommunication systems

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,319
our academy software foundation a

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
partnership with the motion picture

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,319
academy

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,319
is one of the main tools that's used to

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,120
create the incredible digital effects

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,760
that you see

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,159
in hollywood films like the avengers or

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,560
star wars or many many more

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,319
our automotive grade linux initiative is

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,519
used in millions of production

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,239
automobiles to change the automotive

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
experience

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,360
into a digital one as you go back and

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,000
forth in your automobile

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
and i can keep going we have many many

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,920
more

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,640
these projects are the results of a

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,959
massive

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
development effort even though the linux

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
foundation

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
only has a couple of hundred employees

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,079
we have over 250

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,280
000 developers from 18 000 companies

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,079
who participate in our projects on an

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,759
average day

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,320
at the linux foundation's family of

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,120
projects over two million lines of code

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,120
are added

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,080
over 1.6 million lines of code are

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
deleted and over 3.6 million lines of

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,880
code are modified

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,919
that is every single day

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,160
it is an amazing feat

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,360
and it takes a lot more than just

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,240
committing code

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,160
to make these projects tick you have to

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
make sure that the entire production

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
pipeline

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,639
for building and releasing and

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,600
distributing the software

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,479
works effectively that there's a robust

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,520
downstream

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,400
community of organizations and

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,360
uh products that consume this code and

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,360
repackage it

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
and create value from that for

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,320
themselves

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
and then take a small portion of that

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,199
value and reinvest it back

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,919
in these upstreams this is a huge

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,680
endeavor

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,600
and these statistics you're seeing right

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
now represent

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
just how big that endeavor can be at the

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,080
foundation

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
we kick off a couple hundred thousand

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,840
builds annually

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,840
process hundreds of thousands of jira

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,320
tickets and github issues

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,840
we manage over a hundred ten thousand

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,160
email groups

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,800
what's crazy is i looked the other day

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,440
and we're hosting over

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:45,520
27 000 video meetings

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,000
annually we have 188 000 people in our

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,000
slack and chat channels and hold over

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,039
150 events like this

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,199
annually with over 44 000

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,919
attendees the intellectual property

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,720
sharing is

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,639
also an important aspect of making sure

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,240
that that virtuous cycle

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,560
of upstream co-development working with

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
all of our partners and developers at

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
the linux foundation

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,520
results in downstream products and

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,840
services

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,600
that create value that can be reinvested

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,520
back upstream

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,280
intellectual property is the cornerstone

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
of that being able to share what you

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,080
want to share

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,639
and keep what you want to keep is

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,680
critical to enable this sharing

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,800
and to that end the linux foundation has

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,080
a robust team of attorneys and people

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
who manage the process

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,880
of sharing intellectual property we

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,479
manage over 29 000 contribution

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,120
agreements annually

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,000
and have processed over 700 trademark

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
registrations

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,800
around the world and you don't just need

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,560
to do intellectual property management

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,560
you also need to make sure that people

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,360
who are working on these projects

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,400
know how to participate in them and

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
equally importantly

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,560
know how to use the source code that

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,080
results from these projects

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,160
and to that end we have over 1.5

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
million people who have enrolled in our

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,199
free training courses

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,560
a thousand people a day sign up for

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,000
training and certification

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,800
at the foundation forty three 000 people

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
a year enroll in our self-paced online

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,599
e-learning programs

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,560
and over 300 people a week take a

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,680
performance-based certification exam

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,720
at the linux foundation this year we've

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,000
provided over

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
500 scholarships to give free access to

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,280
people

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,520
in need or from diverse backgrounds to

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,720
that training material

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,080
it's been an amazing time to see people

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
embrace virtual learning to find new

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,840
skills

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,560
and participate in our communities

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,759
security is the other important thing at

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
the linux foundation

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,360
in terms of making sure these projects

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
are trusted

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,280
and can result in big market changing

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
outcomes

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,639
you know at the linux foundation we host

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
the let's encrypt project

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,319
that has issued over a billion tls

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,639
certificates

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,599
it's the world's largest certificate

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,319
authority

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
enabling privacy and security across the

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,639
entire

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,080
internet we enabled developers to find

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,039
over 240 000 vulnerabilities in our

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,039
projects

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,560
through toolings that constantly scan

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,120
these code bases

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,000
and report vulnerabilities as well as

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
suggest

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
fixes over eleven thousand of those bugs

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,000
have been fixed

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
and over sixteen thousand fixes have

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
been recommended

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,360
and while we have a long way to go in

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
making sure that the code that comes out

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
of our projects

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,839
is secure robustly tested and has a

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,880
robust application security framework

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,200
around it

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,160
we could continue to make strides we've

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
had over

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,560
3 300 projects enroll in our secure

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,839
coding badging program over the period

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,080
of a few years

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
this is going to result in more secure

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,480
code that helps make us

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,360
all safer as we consume these amazing

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,839
open source

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
projects

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,080
now in addition to just the work that we

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,360
do

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,399
to facilitate these incredible developer

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
communities

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,760
the linux foundation itself has

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,480
responded to the covid pandemic

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,920
you know early in the pandemic was just

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,760
a body blow to

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,399
our team and to our communities events

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,360
in person make up such an important part

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,240
of how we

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,760
work at the linux foundation and those

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,040
came to an abrupt

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,680
halt our first priority was to make sure

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,959
that we keep our communities and staff

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,880
safe

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,800
by providing them with a virtual work

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,839
environment and giving them

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,480
the health and support that they need

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,120
their daily lives i'm proud to say that

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,160
we've kept

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,480
our entire team together despite the

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,279
financial impact that the kovid pandemic

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,120
has had on us here in the united states

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,959
and we're very proud of the fact that

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,200
our team has been able to

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,360
retrain from areas that were no longer

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,720
relevant to our business today

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,240
and provide contributions

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
uh in other ways we've also pivoted in

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,240
an amazing way

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,800
to virtual events just like this angela

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,760
brown

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,480
and her team have done an amazing job of

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,279
providing

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,079
a myriad of platforms from small to

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,720
large

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,760
to enable the best virtual experience we

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,240
can possibly provide

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,160
we saw the devastating impact that the

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
kovid pandemic has had on people's

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,440
careers

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,320
and immediately expanded our mentoring

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
program

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,399
to bring more people into our community

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,880
pair them with

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,160
developers who have the know-how and

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,040
experience

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,880
to guide and mentor them and enable job

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,000
opportunities for them

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,160
as the pandemic continues we expanded

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,959
our training scholarships as i mentioned

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
before

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,640
and have seen an amazing uptick in the

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,480
number of people who are willing to

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,959
retrain and reskill

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
which gives us an amazing amount of hope

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,440
for how people can adjust

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,079
and how quickly and strong people are

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,079
during adverse times

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,440
most importantly one of the things that

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,959
we decided to do

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,760
was quietly just start the hard work

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,000
of using all of the skills that we've

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,079
learned in facilitating open source

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,640
to directly impact the covid pandemic

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,320
we did that through our linux foundation

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,600
public health initiative

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,200
led by dan kahn who stepped down as the

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,720
executive director of the cloud native

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,440
computing foundation

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,440
in order to facilitate this incredibly

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,240
impactful project

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,360
to date we've had two contact tracing

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,399
applications come

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,240
into that open source community and

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,360
those projects have been used

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,360
in places like canada ireland

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,920
in the state of new york to enable

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,560
contact tracing in an effective way

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,600
that has contributed to significant

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,839
reductions in spread

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,320
next we looked at some of the difficult

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,639
social issues in the united states

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,360
and decided to roll up our sleeves in a

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,760
racially charged language removal effort

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
across the open source landscape i'll

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,959
talk more about that

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,360
in a few minutes finally we've seen the

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,959
incredible division in isolationism

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,040
around the world

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,320
and as an organization that's committed

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
to global sharing

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,600
and cooperation we have consistently

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,160
made

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
clear statements on the free and open

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,920
nature of open source

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,920
amidst the deepening trade conflict

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,320
around the world

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,959
open source as a freely available public

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,600
good

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,040
is not subject to many of these trade

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,240
regulations

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,200
and is guaranteed to be here now and in

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
the future

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
for all

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,240
and this is something that i think is

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,760
important to remember in 2020

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,440
that open source is by

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,360
its very nature based on collaboration

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,839
not isolation the type of isolationism

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,760
brought on by either the pandemic or

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,079
political winds of change

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
is not something that will last forever

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,800
because

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,880
as all of you know through your

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,200
participation in open source

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,920
it's cooperation that brings us all

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,199
forward

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,399
not isolation open source

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,959
is available to anyone in

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,639
all linux foundation projects anybody

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,680
can participate

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,880
anytime in any of these projects

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:57,120
everyone has access because

00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,440
open source is not a zero sub game

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,880
linux is probably the best example

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,519
of a multi-billion dollar co-development

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
effort

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,720
that has resulted in trillions of

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,560
dollars of

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,880
economic benefit amongst a wide variety

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,240
of

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,079
fierce competitors it is the existence

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,639
proof that we can compete and cooperate

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,480
at the same time and that's what i want

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,480
to leave you all with

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,760
today if you remember nothing else

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,279
the world will come back together

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,560
physically emotionally

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:42,079
and hopefully politically open source

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,800
is built on trust and we must all seek

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,519
to nurture

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,680
and grow that trust to solve the world's

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,560
most difficult problems

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,279
remember all of you have participated in

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,000
communities

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,839
that prove this that can be an example

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,040
to everyone else

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:03,120
that all of us together are smarter

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,000
better and stronger than any one of us

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,839
thank you so much we have a great event

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,959
in store for you today

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,639
before we get into this week's event

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,320
the linux foundation has a few

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,000
announcements that we'd like to share

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
with all of you

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
the first one is an exciting

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,399
announcement from the open chain project

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,079
open chain is an industry standard for

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,440
open source compliant

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:30,959
and is now efficiently an iso

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,680
international standard becoming an iso

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,839
standard

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,199
is an amazing milestone for the open

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
chain project

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,040
they're the first project to graduate

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,360
from the linux foundation's

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,199
joint development foundation has

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,279
submitter program

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,199
it's important to understand that

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,959
because now the linux foundation

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,639
has the capability through the joint

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,920
development foundation

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,959
to take an open source repo all the way

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,240
to a global

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,079
international standard i want to thank

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
and congratulate the open chain project

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,759
for being the first of our projects to

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,600
become an iso standard

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,600
and there will be many more to come

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:14,560
next i'd like to congratulate

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:17,839
someone who became the millionth

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,600
git code committer for the linux

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,519
kernel ricardo mary calderon

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,279
had the fortunate uh timing to make the

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,720
millionth code commit

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,279
to the linux kernel for a project that

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,720
changes about nine times an hour

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,519
his timing was amazing congratulations

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
ricardo

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:44,000
for becoming the millionth committer

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,199
we also oddly and coincidentally

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,680
hit a milestone in our free edx

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
linux training course at around the same

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,759
time

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,120
where we now have over a million people

00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,240
who have taken our free intro to linux

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,120
course congratulations to everyone who's

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,199
participated

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,640
in these amazing efforts and on these

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,760
incredible milestones

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:14,480
our next announcement involves

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,559
the communities of odpi and lfai

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,679
today they're announcing that they're

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,400
coming together

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,280
under a new linux foundation umbrella

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,959
effort

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,880
linux foundation ai and data

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,280
this consolidated and focused effort

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,320
will enable additional collaboration

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,679
and integration in the space of ai

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,600
m a ml dl and data

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,440
combining efforts in both spaces will

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,640
bring developers and projects

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,360
under a single roof orchestrated by a

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,559
single technical advisory council and

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
several committees

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,679
trusted ai bi and ai

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,360
to work together towards building the

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,960
open source ai data

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,400
ecosystem and accelerating development

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,720
in innovation

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,520
you know hosting projects under a single

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,400
umbrella

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,640
enables closer collaboration integration

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,679
and

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,760
interoperability across projects and is

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,039
a proven recipe for building

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,080
strong open source ecosystems

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,679
at the same time it will provide unified

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,880
guidance to end users

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,760
on tools interoperability integration

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,799
standards and the future of ai data and

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,520
analytics

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,280
as its use continues to grow in every

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,280
industry

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,640
furthermore as a member driven

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,760
organization

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,640
joining forces under lfai and data will

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,039
allow for

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
greater efficiency and lower cost for

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,720
our members

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,039
across various services we offer to our

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
hosted projects

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,720
we're really happy to see these two

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,080
projects coming together and expect

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,080
amazing things in the future

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,160
as i mentioned before the linux

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,799
foundation has also begun

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,679
an effort around racially charged

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,000
language

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,160
in our open collection of open source

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,919
projects and open source projects beyond

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,840
the linux foundation's family

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,679
it's important for us to remove this

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,360
racially charged language

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,280
and as a part of that today we're

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,280
announcing the new software

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,480
developer diversity and inclusion

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,760
project

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,480
sddi will explore evaluate and promote

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,320
best practices and research in industry

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,120
to increase diversity inclusion

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,160
in software engineering and according to

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,720
stack overflow's 2020 survey

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,760
more than 60 of six more than 65 000

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,960
developers

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,320
today 91.7 percent

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,480
identify as male 70

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,320
identify as white or of european descent

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,000
you know if you think of those numbers

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
if you think of that racially charged

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,440
language

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,799
there is a tremendous amount of work to

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,280
be done to create

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,160
inclusive environments that can lead to

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,160
a more diverse community building

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,840
in the software communities that are a

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,039
foundation of our digital

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:09,679
society at the linux foundation

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:12,799
many of you know that we have a uh

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,760
biased language training course for our

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,159
speakers

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,320
that we promote these efforts constantly

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,720
but we need to do more

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,960
research indicates that racially diverse

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,520
groups make better decisions

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,280
they create better outcomes they're more

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
productive

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,400
and gender diverse groups improve

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,440
attitudes

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,360
towards women there are a variety of

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,559
initial contributors and we invite you

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,720
to participate

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,000
for details please visit our newsroom at

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,039
linuxfoundation.org

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,880
finally i'm also excited to share one of

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,600
our earliest projects

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,640
the yakto project today they're

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,760
celebrating their

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,000
10th year anniversary

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,120
and the chair of the yakdo project is

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,840
here to share a few words about the past

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,039
present and future of the project please

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,200
welcome

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:10,159
andrew waffa thanks jim

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,600
welcome everyone i'm andrew woffer

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
chairperson of the octo project

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,679
so let me take you back to a time when

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,880
toy story 3 was the highest grossing

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,080
movie

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,320
spain were crowned champions

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,159
football world cup down south africa

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,600
serena williams and rafael nadal

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,280
were crowned singles champions of

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:35,120
wimbledon and sebastian vettel

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,400
championed formula one yes 2010

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,400
had many great achievements

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,720
one of those achievements was when nine

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,720
companies came together in cambridge

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,840
and launched the october project one of

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,480
the linux foundation's

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,840
oldest projects after limits kernel

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,000
naturally

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,000
this memory band of nine didn't create

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,799
an embedded distro

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,200
they created a set of tools that enable

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,039
you

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,039
to create a custom limits platform

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,039
from those humble beginnings the octa

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,799
project has grown to encompass 25

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,799
companies and organizations

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,840
in a three-tiered structure with

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,840
discussions on more members joining

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,880
this year alone has seen four new

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,559
members join in 2020

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,000
microsoft joining us as platinum member

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,559
automated grade linux joining us gold

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
and foundry's io and subway fare joining

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,520
at silver

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,679
xilinx long-time member has upped their

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,960
involvement in the project

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
and increased to platinum

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,320
over the last 10 years we've averaged 40

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,760
patches and 105 emails

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,080
every single day 7 days a week 52 weeks

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,080
a year

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,440
as a project we don't wish to wrestle

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,799
our worlds

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,159
we've done a great job over the last

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:03,039
decade and we're going to do more

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,799
we want you to join in on that journey

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,080
whether you join as a member

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,120
contributor or user help us

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,120
shape the next 10 years

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,200
behind technology there's a community

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,440
at the octa project we firmly believe

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,760
that we're not just a collection of

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,039
technologies and companies

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,320
at our heart is indeed a community

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,080
our work groups are made up of

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,280
volunteers from our members our

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,280
governing board

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,120
helped drive and influence the project

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,640
and our technical steering committee

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,720
is elected from the wide contributor

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,200
base

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,679
all the while working closely with

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,679
upstream

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,400
at the octa project we believe in the

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,440
power of many

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,120
being a key enabler for success the

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,640
october project's multi-architecture

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,679
supporting mips power pc arm amd

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,039
intel and this enables easy porting of

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,760
code from one architecture

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,679
to another all with a single comfort

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,000
climate change

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,960
with multi-os with support for zen

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,159
freebsd

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,919
and zephyr in addition to linux

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,440
with multi-config allowing multiple

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:23,200
recipes for a single target to be built

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,919
and we're an enabler for crazy ideas

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,400
we are very much a toolbox that enables

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,840
you

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,520
to think and work outside the normal

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,760
realms

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:41,520
the strong core our technological muscle

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,799
can prove itself the octoproject is used

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,320
in almost every single segment of life

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,440
from the home with the likes of set-top

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,320
boxes from comcast and tvs from lg

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,440
to mars with the marco cubesat you'll

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,440
also find us in cars

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:03,520
where automotive grade linux is used

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,039
you'll find us the data centers where

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,880
server management control

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,600
interfaces are running open bmc

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,120
we help get data moved around powering

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
devices from the likes of cisco and

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,840
juniper

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,640
and new networking technologies like

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,760
terraform from facebook

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,919
lastly we are very much a thing at the

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,840
heart of microsoft azure sphere platform

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,840
for iot

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,320
be many technological innovations within

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
the octa project

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,360
i'll try and name a few that have

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,840
happened over the last decade

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,840
first came out layer model

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,279
this enables the ability to

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,200
compartmentalize updates maintenance and

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,200
configurations

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,720
before containers were mainstream our

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,840
tooling leveraged cis roots

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,240
allowing you to build in isolation with

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,279
determinism

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,240
more recently we've got

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,679
hash equivalency this is a new way

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,240
reusing previously built

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,640
binary artifacts to allow reproducible

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,640
bills

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,600
so thank you and to learn more please

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,120
come by our virtual booth

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,200
participate in one of our sessions

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,080
listed here and lastly

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,840
we've got our very own summit co-located

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,960
here

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,039
running october 29th to 30th

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,440
i hope you enjoy the rest of the event

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,440
goodbye

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,679
thank you for joining us andrew and

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,720
congratulations to everyone involved in

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,799
the octo project

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,640
now and over the years you should really

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,039
be proud of the work that you've done

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,640
and

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:45,039
continue to do it's just amazing stuff

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,559
our next speaker this morning is vice

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,200
president of open source

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,080
engineering at cloud native security

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,279
specialist

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,279
aqua security she is also chair of the

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,760
cloud native computing foundation's

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,400
technical oversight committee and was

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,240
co-chair of kubecon and cloudnativecon

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,159
in 2018. today she joins us to share

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,320
practical steps and learnings

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,520
that could help you unlock the open

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,440
source potential

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:20,960
for your own business please welcome

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:23,919
liz rice

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,880
hi i'm liz rice and i run the open

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,039
source engineering team at aqua security

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,520
where we build cloud native security

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,240
solutions for enterprise

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,080
when i joined aqua nearly four years ago

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,559
it was an early stage startup

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,399
working on proprietary security software

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,120
with paying customers

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,440
but today open source is a fundamental

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,520
part of our strategy

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,679
i want to share some thoughts on how we

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,799
got the more commercially oriented folks

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,799
in the company

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,159
really bought into this idea of open

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,679
source and

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,559
share some of the reasons it's been

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,240
really good for our business

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,000
now my guess is that since this is a

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,240
conference about open source

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,039
the vast majority of us are already

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,760
convinced that

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,720
open source is a good thing in the world

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,200
so today

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,799
i want to focus on how it can be a good

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,200
thing for your business

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,080
and give you some tools and examples

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
that might help

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,279
you convince other people particularly

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,200
the more commercially oriented folks

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,240
about the benefits of open source in

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,240
your organization

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,440
if this conference was happening in real

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,559
life at this point i would

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,399
ask for a show of hands to find out how

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,960
many of you work for an organization

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,840
that

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,559
sells software i'm sure there'll be many

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,919
of you here who work for companies where

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,399
the main business is something

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,000
completely different like banking or

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,960
selling shoes

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,520
but for many of us many of our employers

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,520
software is the heart of our business

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,440
certainly true that for aqua our

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,520
commercial success is

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,640
really defined in terms of the revenue

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,039
we get from

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,960
selling software that's what we do for a

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,360
living

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,960
and in an organization that's used to

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,679
selling software

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,960
it can be challenging to get everyone on

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,840
board with the idea of giving it away

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,320
you can easily end up in what i like to

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,279
call

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,919
the apache license conversation and this

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,440
is

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,840
not a approach i recommend

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,399
imagine you work in a company that

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,240
currently has no open source software

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,240
but you have the idea of releasing

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,840
something open source

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,600
you've decided you want to give it a

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,120
permissive license like

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,000
apache 2 you explain the license to your

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,120
ceo your cfo maybe your chief revenue

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,360
officer

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,720
and you end up having a conversation

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,919
that goes something like this

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,080
so anyone can use our software for free

00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:01,090
yes and that includes our competitors

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,399
using it for free yes they can

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,399
[Music]

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,559
and is there anything stopping our

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,000
competitors from taking our software and

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,520
selling it

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,520
no absolutely nothing

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,240
and at this point your ceo your cfo your

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,799
cro

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,039
is looking at you wondering what on

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,200
earth you're talking about

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,720
if you want them to come with you on

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,320
this open source journey

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,480
you're going to need to be really well

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,919
prepared with some arguments for

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,279
why this is worth doing so i'm going to

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,480
share some of the arguments that i've

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,080
made myself

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,840
and some of the ways that we've been

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,760
able to show value

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,760
from our work in open source

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,480
for us the buyer persona is typically a

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,720
chief information security officer

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,880
who maybe hasn't been so close to a

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,520
command line terminal in a while

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,720
but they have a lot of very technical

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,240
hands-on people

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,080
reporting to them and influencing them

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,840
and for many technical products the

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,039
people using it day to day

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,480
are engineers

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,240
they typically don't hold budget

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,320
themselves but they

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,559
may well be in a technical department

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,640
that does have money to spend

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,240
and that's particularly true for

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,559
security where businesses

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,399
generally recognize that being hacked or

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,480
losing their data would be

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,880
a potentially expensive situation

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,640
now those engineers the people using

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,159
those tools day to day

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,640
are people that may not be a surprise to

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,760
you but it's worth bearing in mind

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,480
and people like to talk to other people

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,960
and they like

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:48,399
sharing ideas and engineers often have

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,320
common problems that they need to solve

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,880
and when they find a solution to those

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,960
problems they'll want to share it

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
just look at how many times people

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,120
technical folks will share

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,840
information on reddit or twitter or

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,640
hacker news

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,080
so engineers do discuss the solutions

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,600
that they

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,600
find for their problems

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,200
many of those engineers are writing

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,640
software and

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,720
most are paid a salary to do that so

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,480
there's a belief that software has value

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,120
and that people should be compensated

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,399
for that

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,640
time but nevertheless

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,320
engineers usually opt for free solutions

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,159
and i think the reason for that is

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,159
really because they don't have

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,679
discretion over any budget in most

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,240
organizations

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,320
so even if they think at all has value

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,200
it's just a giant pain

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,519
if they have to pay for something and

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,919
submit an expense report

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,559
as an engineer it's much easier to use

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,360
free solutions to your problems

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,399
so this is the first point that your

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,600
commercial

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,760
folks need to understand it's much much

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,399
harder for engineers to try something

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,080
out

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,039
if it's not free even a small price tag

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,080
on your software

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,080
creates friction

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,720
but if it is free and if it is good

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,200
you can build up a community of users

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,760
and potentially even contributors

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,399
who appreciate your open source

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,399
solutions

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,679
in a company like aqua my team that

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,799
builds the open source

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,519
tools has a goal to get as many people

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,000
as possible

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,120
using those open source tools so that

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,440
they become part of our community

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,519
now i've already said those users are

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,840
engineers and they don't hold budget

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,159
so what good is that for a commercial

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,080
company

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,039
for the best part of a decade we've been

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,480
hearing that the developer is king

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,039
for us in cloud native security it's

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,399
i might say devsecops engineers rather

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,200
than just developers

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,039
but the point is that technical folks

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,840
may not hold the purse strings

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,679
but they do have influence and they

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,639
influence the buyers for your

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,639
technical product

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,200
so when our sales team meet with

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,040
the cso the fact that their team

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,560
have already been using aqua's open

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,560
source tools is like a warm introduction

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,720
the cso is probably already familiar

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,839
with the name and perhaps with some of

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,000
our areas of expertise

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,520
so that's the second point to make sure

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,720
the commercial folks in your

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,159
organization

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,159
understand the sales team can leverage

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,560
this awareness of your company and what

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,560
it does

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,040
a good salesperson is helping match up a

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,800
customer with a solution that they need

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,560
and i think that as an engineer it took

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,200
me a long time to realize

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,599
that sales doesn't have to be evil it

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,520
can

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,800
and should be a win for everyone

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,720
involved

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,040
the buyer needs the thing that they're

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,760
buying and they're happy with the value

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,320
obtained for the price that they paid

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,440
and it's only good sales with happy

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,359
customers

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,640
that result in repeat business and a

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,680
good reputation

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,760
for the seller but

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,680
sometimes the buyer doesn't know what

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,440
they need and that's certainly been

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,520
really true for aqua

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,079
where we're still in the relatively

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,480
early days of cloud native adoption

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,400
lots of companies are still learning how

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,160
they want to use cloud native

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,440
and they really haven't figured out yet

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,040
what their security requirements are

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,920
selling them a commercial product at

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,520
that point is probably not going to be

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,920
a good sale but this is where open

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,720
source tools can really help

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,800
they can plug a specific security gap

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,880
for a potential customer

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
while they figure out what solutions

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,119
they really need

00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:00,160
longer term and our sales team

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,320
love this they love being able to

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,240
leave a potential customer with a

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,760
solution to a problem

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,880
even if they haven't got a sale today

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,760
so this is another really useful point

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,280
to make

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,480
if you're trying to get your company on

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,480
board with open source

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,960
another really effective reason for

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,440
commercial companies to

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,200
embrace open source is the multiplier

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,200
effect of community

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,560
i've lost count of the number of times

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,599
people have told me

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,440
they've demoed our tools at a meet-up or

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,720
referred to them in a blog post or even

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,280
a book

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,839
this is an example of what i'm told is

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,640
the world's

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,960
largest doctor meetup where someone

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,359
entirely unrelated to our team

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,680
showed one of our tools to an audience

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,359
of over 500 people

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,040
nobody wants to hear vendor sales

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,400
pictures but engineers do

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,839
love an open source demo

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,160
so if you're struggling to get your

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,560
company to invest in open source

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,800
ask what marketing spend you would need

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,240
to reach a qualified target audience

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,599
like this

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,520
adding the credibility and the

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,599
authenticity of

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,440
that demonstration being shown by

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,480
someone entirely independent

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,760
and this is priceless and it's only

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,480
possible because of

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,480
open source

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,000
no doubt you'll still come back to the

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,560
question

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,560
if we give our software away what can we

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,320
sell

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,160
for some companies it will be things

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,400
like support or training

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,839
you could have open core where some

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,079
features are only available in the

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,160
commercial solution

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,079
for us we've taken a slightly different

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,480
approach that comes down to the problem

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,640
space we're working in

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,920
security in cloud native is a really

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,320
broad problem

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,400
there are lots of different aspects and

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,280
different security tooling

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,800
pieces that you need at different stages

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,480
of the life cycle

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,359
i won't go into that now because this

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,440
isn't a talk about cloud native security

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,359
but the point is that there are plenty

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,680
of different pieces to this

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,760
security puzzle and we've chosen to

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,720
implement some of the pieces of that

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,880
puzzle

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,359
as a set of standalone open source tools

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,560
each of these is a useful thing in its

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,400
own right

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,000
so as a developer an operator or a

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,880
security professional

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,839
i might choose to run one of these open

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,000
source tools

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,240
to solve a particular problem

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,280
our enterprise solution brings

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,240
everything together

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,280
into one place and it adds enterprise

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,640
requirements like

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,480
multi-tenancy single sign-on high-value

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,760
threat intelligence fees

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,000
and additional capabilities

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,040
but it's not really a case of upgrading

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,119
from

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,720
open source to the paid version of that

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,359
tool

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,119
it's more that a small subset of our

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,680
open source users

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,880
eventually reach a point where they need

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,839
an integrated

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,760
scalable solution and because they're

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,400
using open source tools

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,400
from aqua it's natural for them to begin

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,140
a conversation with us about their

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,720
broader needs

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,599
[Music]

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,280
so when your cfo asks how open source is

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,560
going to help you achieve your company's

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,400
financial goals

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,720
you can't pretend that open source by

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,440
itself is going to make you money

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,880
but you can show that it can build value

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,160
for your company

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,160
and there are three key points

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,599
contributing to open source makes it

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,960
more likely that your potential

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,480
customers have heard of you

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,640
so it is a form of marketing open source

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,480
tools can help build familiarity and

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,960
skills amongst your customers

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
it's a way of educating them and helping

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,160
them get to a point where they know what

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,079
they need and are ready to buy

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,560
and open source can help you build a

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,480
community of cheerleaders who value the

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,800
open source tools that you're building

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,040
and are happy to share that knowledge

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,880
spreading awareness way beyond the scope

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,119
of the folks on your payroll

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,960
there are plenty more benefits of

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,040
contributing to open source

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,640
and these are just the ones that i found

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,720
resonate really well

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,040
with folks on the commercial side of the

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,040
house

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,640
to get these benefits you do have to be

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,319
honest about your open source

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,319
contributions

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,160
you can't just slap open source on your

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,359
website which we have seen a few

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,839
companies do

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,839
you really do have to contribute

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,720
something that adds

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,560
value

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,720
if you want to discuss these thoughts or

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,800
any other reasons to embrace open source

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,960
or if you have any other questions about

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,760
our experiences at aqua

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,440
embracing open source i'd be more than

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,960
happy to hear from you

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,520
and you can find out more about our

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,960

how open is not just about code it's

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,760
about

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,400

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,920
who's the founder and chief executive

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,640
officer of streamlytics

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,280
which uses first party media consumption

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,520
data

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,400
to bring transparency to what people are

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,400
streaming

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,640
on today's most popular streaming

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,680
services which help consumers

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,720
own their data in the process as well

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,359
and and she is amazing i met her

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,440
uh earlier this year she's a pioneer in

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,480
diversity in the tech industry

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,960
she started new me which has raised over

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,119
47 million in venture capital funding

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,040
for

00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,040
underrepresented and black founders

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,480
and prior to that she started black web

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,200
2.0

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,119
and i i can't even begin to tell you the

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,079
number of accolades that

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,800
angela has received um throughout the

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,599
years

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,240
for her pioneering work i'm most

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,520
interested

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,160
also in her work on open data and for us

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,440
who are so

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,079
used to open source and open code open

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,280
data

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,400
is really the new frontier and and so

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,839
important for us to be conscious of

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,280
so let me um welcome you angela

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,520
to open source summit europe and

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,880
i look forward to this event every

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,640
single year

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,160
and we just have to pretend we are in

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,720
dublin ireland

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,400
uh even though you are in the west coast

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,440
and i'm on the east coast

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,599
and let's get started

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,000
yeah thank you so much for having me

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,440
i've been looking forward to this since

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,680
we spoke last time and you know um

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,800
i'm really excited just to talk about

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,720
all of the

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,640
changes and progress that have been

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,599
happening in the open source community

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,079
but then also

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,400
with the open data movement as well and

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,359
you're doing well i hope under

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,920
very trying circumstances this year yeah

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,240
i think

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,440
you know i'm doing really really good uh

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,920
which is a blessing

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,760
so i don't have any complaints despite

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,119
everything that's happening

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,520
that's right so given the audience being

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,640
open source developers angela i wanted

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,920
to get started with

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,800
open source as our topic as a ceo of a

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,680
tech startup

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,720
how do you and your team approach open

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,359
source

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,119
software and why is it so important to

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:44,319
you

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,520
great question honestly um

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,960
as a startup it it kind of seems like

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,079
many founders think of open source

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
as what tools that they can use to help

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,560
build

00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,640
um their companies versus what open

00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,400
source tools can they produce to help

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,760
contribute to the community

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,839
and that's one of the things that

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,839
honestly we're trying to do at stream

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,040
lytics and something that

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,880
is really um embedded in our young

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,079
culture but something that i think is

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,839
really important

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,319
so you know a couple of the things that

00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,200
um we

00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,520
are doing internally really it's around

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,079
our product but it's also around

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,160
you know this idea that data really is

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,319
so important and it's powering

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,000
what we're doing right now but it's also

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,640
you know gonna power the the

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,760
future however it's kind of like the

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,119
wild wild west

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,800
so you know if as far as like data

00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,640
standards you know first of all the us

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,960
doesn't have a federal data privacy law

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,119
the eu was way ahead of the game and

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,960
really leading you know

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,640
all of us globally as far as that's

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,200
concerned but there's no

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,359
real data standard for all of these

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,480
different file formats that we get so

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,680
doing a data request is fantastic for a

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,280
consumer

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,599
but not really if you're getting like

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,560
five different you know data types

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,240
and hundreds of data files and so one of

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,240
the things that

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,560
we're doing is we started the universal

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,520
data interchange format which is really

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,560
in its very early stages but the idea

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,960
is basically to have uh

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,400
file processors that process all of

00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,440
these different data files and

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,400
standardize them

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,560
into one unified file which is called a

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,359
unifile that can now be easily

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,520
transferred

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,880
between entities between individuals

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,920
between services

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,240
so um that's at udiff.org and

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,720
um again we're in the super early stages

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,280
of it but honestly we're really just

00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,920
interested in connecting with people who

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,079
um

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,800
understand how important data is but

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,560
then also want to work on something that

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,839
um is innovative that could really

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,720
impact um

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,079
you know our society as a whole um the

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,440
other thing

00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,240
is this idea that your data is not worth

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,560
anything

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,640
um financially and so a lot of people

00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,480
are like oh yeah everyone talks about

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,359
data but your data's only worth like

00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,200
one or two dollars and um there's

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,760
there's you know a lot of data services

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,640
that are paying one or two dollars for

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,400
for your data and um i just don't kind

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,680
of come from that mindset you know i

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,440
come from the mindset

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,079
of um your data is way more valuable

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,880
because

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,880
trillion dollar companies are using them

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,359
and they're making a lot of money off of

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,200
it so

00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,119
inherently based on that your data is

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,240
not worth one or two dollars even if

00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,680
we're talking about

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,760
you know the amount of data that these

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,359
companies have from a scale perspective

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,200
i still think you know your data is

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,440
worth way more and so

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,640
um one of the things that we actually do

00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,800
uh internally

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,880
is we have an algorithm that prices data

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,160
and that's that's really what kind of

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,359
makes us

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,440
a little different um and so our

00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,720
algorithm looks at things like

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,800
okay what is the data source um who

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,720
who what company is this from and what's

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,839
their market capitalization

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,800
and what's their their product usage um

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,640
and also

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,160
what type of data transactions are

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,480
currently taking place

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,720
in the ecosystem and then we kind of

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,839
come up with what we call a data point

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,559
valuation

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:22,319
and that basically now looks at okay at

00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,000
the data point level

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:29,839
this file from amazon

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,359
it has you know 5 000 data points in it

00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,960
at the data point level this is the

00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,920
value of it so we should pay

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,119
xyz for this file and so that's what we

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,000
use internally

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,599
um and we're in the process of uh trying

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,960
to open source that as well

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,839
because honestly i feel like

00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,240
we need tools as entrepreneurs and as

00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,359
developers to build on top of if we

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,680
really say

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,880
you know and believe that our data's

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,280
worth more

00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,880
then we need to kind of be able to take

00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,319
action on that and so

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:05,040
you know i'm happy to to be able to um

00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,000
release the algorithm to the open source

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,920
community

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
um when the time is right so people can

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,280
build on top of it and build their own

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,880
things with it but it's

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,040
that we all kind of agree at a

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,079
foundational level your data is worth

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,040
more

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,960
i think it's incredibly powerful that as

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,000
a startup you're not just

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,040
consuming content and tools you're

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,319
actually

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,559
starting new standards and open sourcing

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,640
you know things and tools that could be

00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,760
very very helpful and useful to

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,640
really transforming this data industry

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,119
and it's it's it's powerful what you're

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,520
doing

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,480
um you're actually putting a price on

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,440
people's data

00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,680
and we often gave it up for free yeah to

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,440
be used by companies like you said and

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,880
and we also have no control

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,200
over how they use it or what it looks

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,760
like

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,400
what profile they create of us which

00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,960
really leads to

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,040
the question about why should people

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,400
especially underrepresented people

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,240
care about how companies are profiling

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,359
them or using their data

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,359
and what should developers

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,440
think about when they're creating new

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,960
platforms especially

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,839
to protect identity of people as well as

00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,839
privacy

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:26,319
and to really watch out for

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,760
algorithms that could kind of mislead

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,960
people into making

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,760
you know really terrible decisions yeah

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,800
you know we are we're gonna all look

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,200
back on the time

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,160
that we're in now and realize how

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,599
transformative

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,920
it is for how we're going to live our

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,480
future because you know we're really

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,200
moving

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,720
to things and decisions being made by

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,760
algorithms and

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:53,040
one of the biggest issues with that is

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,640
if the builders of that are not coming

00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,599
from diverse places

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,000
and they're building the algorithms to

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,640
be

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,400
myopic you know what i mean and so you

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,359
know a great case on point of that

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,079
is facial recognition software which you

00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,520
know we

00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,200
all know that it doesn't recognize

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,079
darker skinned people

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,559
um but it wasn't until you know the

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,400
global protest for black lives matter

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,960
where you know a lot of large tech

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,200
companies are finally like oh no no

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,720
we're not going to be reselling this to

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,559
law enforcement when this has been a

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,280
thing you know that's been happening

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,240
for years and quite frankly um should

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,839
have been addressed

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,760
way earlier shouldn't take global

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,640
protests you know for

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,680
for something like that to happen but it

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:43,359
really honestly speaks to

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:47,119
um from a developer perspective

00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:50,480
us being courageous and

00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:53,200
confident enough to speak up um

00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,559
to leadership at times when we are

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,800
building things that we don't

00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,599
necessarily believe in and that don't

00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,200
reflect

00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,640
the world that we all want to live in

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,040
today you know

00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,400
and honestly even in the future because

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,520
even from a pure

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,880
statistics standpoint when you look at

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,720
the globe the globe is majority

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,599
minority right now and then when you

00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:19,520
look at um the growth between

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:22,160
now 2020 and 2050 most of that growth

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,680
is coming from the black diaspora and

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,680
this is this is from

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,720
you know a study done by the world bank

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,040
and imf

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,760
and so that's a very very scary place to

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,760
be in

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,920
when we have algorithms like facial

00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,920
recognition algorithms or

00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,839
you know loan application loan

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,520
algorithms that are approving if someone

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,359
gets a house or if someone

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,720
is able to buy a car or gets a credit

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:46,800
card are making

00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:49,280
assumptions based on data that um

00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,640
is not necessarily accurate and doesn't

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:55,440
take into account a diverse data set

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,079
absolutely and and i think you're

00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,839
bringing up

00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,800
a really good point that there is a

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,720
place for culture and tech absolutely

00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,200
tech should care about culture and

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,319
technology should care about culture

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:11,599
um you also talk about

00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:13,680
um learning how to be more

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,079
fair and equitable and create more fair

00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,920
and equitable platforms

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,520
and i think at new me you learned a lot

00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,000
of lessons also about

00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,960
funding and making the world more

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,720
equitable

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,359
can you share more of the lessons you

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,480
learned from funding side from

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,280
startup side how can we create a more

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,319
equitable

00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,920
tech culture and a tech world

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:41,040
i learned so much from from new me

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,200
i mean first of all anytime you're the

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,839
first person to start something it's

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,040
going to be like

00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:48,480
really really hard and so i was excited

00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,079
to see that there were other people in

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,079
the space of what i was doing with

00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,640
streamlytics because nume was very hard

00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,119
i mean

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,880
we were the first accelerator globally

00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,440
you know for people of color

00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,319
and we were based in silicon valley and

00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,040
so

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,720
you know there were conversations that i

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,280
would have on a regular basis

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,280
with you know your average tech bro that

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,319
would be like now why do we need an

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,960
accelerator

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:15,200
for you know minorities all of the

00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,440
information that anybody needs

00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,599
um is online you just have to google it

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,319
tech is a meritocracy there's no place

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,079
for

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:27,200
you know culture and technology and

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,839
you know it was saddening because it's a

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,960
very

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:34,079
basic point but they would consistently

00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,160
miss that if you don't know what to

00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,440
search for because you come from a

00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,319
different group or a different

00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,079
background

00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,480
then you don't get access to the

00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,599
information it doesn't matter if it's on

00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,520
google or

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,799
you know on the internet if you don't

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,799
know what to search for

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,040
and if no one is speaking to you so that

00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,680
you can digest it and say oh this is

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,680
like this so you need to search for this

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,599
um you just won't have access to the

00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,599
information and so

00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,920
uh you know from that perspective um

00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,440
it was certainly hard to be in

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,040
situations like that

00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,559
um but to be honest it really speaks to

00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,319
the earlier point

00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:16,640
that i said so you know not just as

00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,960
developers but honestly as a human being

00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:22,079
like you have to be able to

00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,200
um stand up for what you believe in um

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,160
even when it's not

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,920
the popular choice um for us all to

00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,240
create a world that we want to live in

00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,760
and

00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:34,640
and i did that really on a daily basis

00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,799
when i was running new me um and you

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,079
know from a fundraising perspective that

00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,640
also meant

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,480
um from several different perspectives

00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,440
working with founders who were

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,480
terrified to ask for a million dollars

00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,280
like people don't

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,440
we have to literally work and coach you

00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,880
know founders to get comfortable even

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,280
saying a million dollars out of their

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,920
mouth

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,880
you know what i mean let alone being in

00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,119
a pitch meeting

00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,920
you know in person with the vc and

00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,839
thinking

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,680
you know uh oh my god are they gonna

00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,480
think i'm stupid or if i mispronounce

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,920
something or

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:11,119
or whatever and so you know there is

00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,680
there is a place for sure for everyone

00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,960
in tech

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,079
um the beauty of of technology is i do

00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,880
remember when the internet

00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,720
industry you know very first started it

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,480
was super diverse and it was kind of

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,640
like a place for misfits and people to

00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,119
think creatively and experiment

00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,400
and we got away from that to be honest

00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,520
but i do think there

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,160
is a chance for you know all of us to

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,359
bring that back especially if we have

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,400
our own personal

00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:40,480
code you know of standards that we apply

00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,839
to other people and we

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,079
make sure that people are being

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:47,119
inclusive and we make sure that people

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,079
are contributing um to the the industry

00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,640
but then also

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,000
society and in the way that we feel like

00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,640
it should be

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,480
yeah absolutely and we need to speak up

00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,200
and we need to make sure that people

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,480
are doing the right thing and opening

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,839
doors for

00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,480
others but you did a great deal when you

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,599
were

00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,400
doing nume and continue to i love what

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,079
you do

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,720
in educating people about

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,760
their right to data how to ask for the

00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,079
data

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,119
and how to process it and that they can

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,880
monetize it

00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:26,000
and that um how it's being used by

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,599
companies and others you know so i

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,520
really appreciate that

00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,680
i just wanted to also share that the

00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,079
linux foundation for example

00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,760
has been working also to recognize that

00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,640
data has become such an important

00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,119
element

00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,000
and they've been creating um both

00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,440
permissive

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,760
and copyleft licenses for sharing data

00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,319
with

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,440
computational algorithms and you know

00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:51,119
for others

00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:55,119
and people can find it at cdla

00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:58,640
dot io on the linux foundation's website

00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:01,200
so let me see um if we can

00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,680
go on to talking about a couple of other

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,000
things

00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,280
um i love what you're doing at stream

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,720
analytics

00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:12,240
and um what do

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:15,280
uh the creators of um

00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,920
art and music benefit from

00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,599
and how are they being treated in by

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,920
these platforms and

00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:24,000
uh how are you helping to make it more

00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,520
equitable for creators of

00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,400
content like that yeah you know a lot of

00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,200
people

00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,000
um well issa rae is actually an investor

00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,000
in

00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,319
our company and so a lot of people see

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,400
her involvement and she's a creator she

00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:41,440
started out on youtube

00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,319
and is doing great work with insecure um

00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,319
on hbo um but a lot of people see her

00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:49,440
involvement and i'm like oh my god this

00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:51,920
is great for creators and

00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,119
um we're really not focused on creators

00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,319
to be honest we

00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:59,359
are focused on everyday people who

00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:02,480
are creating data from their

00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:04,640
walking from point a to point b um

00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,160
and helping them actually understand

00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,000
that their data has value

00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,319
that they can monetize it but that they

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,960
can also own it and so to your earlier

00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,599
point

00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,280
you know a part of what we're doing is

00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,880
we make sure that

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,359
people who sign up for our product on

00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,319
culture.io

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:23,520
can sign a data license they sign a data

00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,559
license that says

00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:29,359
hey anything that you upload to culture

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:32,319
um this is actually your data it's not

00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,160
ours and we're licensing it from you so

00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:36,000
that that's the first thing and the

00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,599
reason why this is important

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,480
and kind of to connect it to culture in

00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,839
general

00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:47,200
um and in content um producers

00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:49,760
is um as far as you know

00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,119
the black community is concerned we do a

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,160
fantastic job

00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:58,079
at creating you know amazing music

00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:01,599
um amazing works of art in terms of film

00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,880
um in television um amazing

01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,880
uh hashtags on twitter uh

01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,480
and we make you know a lot of stuff

01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,599
trend globally

01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,920
um so the issue there is

01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,440
this community is a powerful community

01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,240
that is really driving

01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,400
popular culture and it's making a lot of

01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,000
money for a lot of big corporations but

01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,200
none of that really goes back

01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,280
into that community and so you know the

01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,520
way i'm thinking about it is well if we

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,599
focus on the everyday person and help

01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,119
educate them on the importance of data

01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,319
and that their data is

01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,000
powering all of this stuff then

01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:39,920
when we're paying out data we can

01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,520
actually move some of that wealth

01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,359
that many of these big companies are

01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,480
making and put it directly back into the

01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:47,520
community so

01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,119
the connection for us is you know

01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,599
there is a connection to content

01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,240
producers and and you know the great

01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,880
forms of art um and creativity that's

01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,160
happening

01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:01,440
from creators in in

01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:03,599
society but honestly it really for

01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,960
us goes right back to the everyday

01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,359
consumer

01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,400
that that makes a lot of sense so i want

01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,960
to wrap up

01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,240
um since we are coming close to our 20

01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,240
minutes believe it or not

01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,440
and on wow it is incredible

01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,440
is there a call to action you have for

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,240
this audience can they get involved

01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,200
in some of the work that you're doing

01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,240
