hello calista redmond here

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,160
from risk five happy to field any

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,280
questions

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,920
on the uh risk five revolution we

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,279
are absolutely seeing a continued

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,480
ongoing growth and

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,000
building momentum around the world

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,840
i would love to share any details on

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,599
risk 5 that are of interest to the

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,679
community or in

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:45,840
how to navigate open source as a

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:45,840
community or as a corporation

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
okay i think i'm able to see the

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
questions now

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,479
apologies for a little bit of that delay

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
uh

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,960
we have absolutely seen a lot of great

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,520
uh

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,799
excitement around automotive in

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,400
particular

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,759
and uh let's say now i can't see that

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,799
question anymore

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,119
uh in particular we have a safety

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,640
committee that has spun up we are

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,439
continuing to see

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,960
growth around interest in joining that

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,000
committee we have

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,840
seen public news releases

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,759
using nvidia with uh risk 5

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,000
around automotive at the software level

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,960
you know the safety and critical

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
features in

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,399
automotive have been paramount in our

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,399
risk 5 community

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,040
let's see what we have going on in the

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,280
chat here

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,280
so i got i think that one and then

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,599
how long do you think it will be until

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,080
we have a desktop machine running risk

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,120
five

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
almost a trick question so uh sci-fi

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,879
has recently announced that they are

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,519
able to do risk five in a pc based soc

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,120
and that is something that has uh

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,920
already hit the news

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,640
you know risk five has uh had start had

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,280
its start

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,040
in embedded and it looks like we are

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
growing very quickly

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,480
uh from embedded to enterprise and

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,519
everything in between

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,319
so not just desktops and other

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,480
devices that could go either as a plug

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,519
in the wall or on battery operation

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,360
but also in data centers and everything

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,920
in between you know you've got

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,879
alibaba in china that has deployed risk

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,319
five

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,239
uh using uh the risk five features

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,879
specifically for ai

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,200
uh we see that as a common theme with

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,599
multinationals who are looking at risk

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
five

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,120
to really build on kind of the new

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,280
workloads and new opportunities

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
more so than say replacing legacy

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,640
architectures

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,159
you also see risk five growing in hpc

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,959
so hpc is something that has been

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,360
very important across many industries

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,799
and

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,560
has also seen the need for acceleration

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:48,480
and and ai capabilities and we see that

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,640
most prominently in europe with the

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,400
european processor initiatives uh

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,080
designating risk five as

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,080
a part of that uh group

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
keeping up with the questions here wow

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,159
guys you guys are firing

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,400
away which is fantastic uh so then

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,080
why would one use risk five what are the

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,959
main advantages

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,519
so you know risk five from a technical

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,720
level

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,439
has a lot of benefits it is a modular

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
isa

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,639
meaning that you start with one small

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,560
base building block

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,800
47 instructions in fact very lightweight

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
rather than starting with a legacy

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,560
architecture

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,919
or a legacy isa that has been more

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,680
incrementally built

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,800
and has grown over time one popular

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,440
isa is 1500 instructions

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
that's a lot to go through and you know

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,880
when you think about the number of

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,680
instructions that you are required to

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,840
use or that you need to be compliant to

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
transparency is key and that

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,240
transparency allows you to see

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
everything going on uh which is a

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,759
critical

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
aspect for security so they're you know

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,160
you can see everything there are no back

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
doors

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,000
uh you don't have the same risks as

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,320
others have had

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,120
around some of those malicious attacks

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
or other

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,400
uh aspects around security so it is seen

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,360
as a

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,120
prominent feature of risk five and again

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,840
that modular approach means that you can

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
add on

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,759
the extensions that are critical for

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,000
your workload now that's the technical

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,720
side on the business side of things

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,199
uh it's free and open there are no voice

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,440
license fees no royalty fees in fact

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,759
that expands your opportunity to work

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
with

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,479
other innovation partners to expand your

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,199
supply chain options

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,080
to really grow globally you don't have

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,680
the barriers

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,000
of and constraints that come with a

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,800
pay-to-play licensing model or royalty

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,080
model

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,560
so that business opportunity expands not

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
only

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,880
in kind of the partners you can bring on

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,880
to build your product but also

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
the market opportunity and where you can

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,639
take your product

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,800
so as those things expand so does your

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,960
market opportunity allowing

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
our innovators to go into adjacent

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,319
spaces to team

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,840
with others who can leverage some of the

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,840
innovations that they've done together

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,880
let's see what else we have here can you

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
talk in general about the latest

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,400
developments with silicon implementing

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
risk five what is the most advanced

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,720
process technology that risc-v

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,919
core is being targeted for i think i've

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,440
addressed that a little bit in the

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,759
different workload types

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,000
uh you know the the explosion and

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
opportunity is really around those new

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,199
workloads

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,280
uh we've you know kind of settled into

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,440
some legacy models for

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,319
some of the existing workloads but the

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,280
explosion and opportunity is tremendous

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
we see more than 60 billion cores coming

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,440
to market

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,919
in on risk 5 by 2025

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,160
we see global interest in that whether

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,800
those are folks who are looking for new

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
innovation

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
options or to take down barriers on the

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,520
business or political landscape

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
we see a lot of interest today we have

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,319
about a third of our membership

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,400
in north america about a third in europe

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,199
and about a third in apac

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,800
so that collaboration opportunity has

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,319
expanded tremendously

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,800
as has the market opportunity uh the

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,720
major biggest roadblocks or major

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,199
problem between different risk

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,039
five implementations different isas and

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,400
verification

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,599
so you know the roadblocks have uh

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,199
primarily been around um

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
you know kind of how mature is the

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,960
technology and

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
you know those legacy architectures have

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,120
been around for decades well the good

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,520
news

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
is risk architectures generally have

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,039
also been around for decades so you're

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,400
not fundamentally learning

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,240
a new isa but we are

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,240
continuing to work and grow the

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,120
ecosystem of uh

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,120
innovations that surround the isa so

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,199
those may be extensions those might be

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
tools and design resources

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,879
and those are growing very rapidly in

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,319
fact this is the fastest growth open

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,000
hardware play that this that the

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
industry has ever seen

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,039
and it is about time you know if you

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,680
look back on the

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,520
80s when there was a processor battle

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,639
and that settled out to a few

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,039
uh kind of large players right

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,879
and now we're seeing the growth

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,720
fundamentally at all levels whether they

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
are multinationals putting a toe in the

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,160
water with microcontrollers or

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,360
entrepreneurs building brand new

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,240
businesses

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
with a slew of investors around the

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
risc-5 architecture

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,560
so it really is an opportunity for

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,039
growth in all levels

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,959
but it does take time we are not as old

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,039
as those legacy architectures that have

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,519
been building their ecosystems for as

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,159
many decades as they've been around

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,160
but we do have an incredible community

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,560
that's growing very rapidly in fact

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,560
we've

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,480
achieved more than 50 growth in our

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,839
membership just since the beginning of

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
2020.

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,720
that is in an era of uh you know all the

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,920
struggles and challenges that our world

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,399
has faced

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,440
but with challenge comes the opportunity

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
for disruption

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
and that's what we're seeing in the risk

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,760
five community

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,839
so why is risk 5 isa better than other

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,959
open isas so that's sort of a

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,279
a question around other open isa models

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,000
in fact if you go to mark himmelstein's

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,640
uh

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,480
kind of talk on risk 5 from a technical

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,279
view he gives a great

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,120
kind of synopsis of where other open

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,920
isas have come from

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,399
and i'll sort of you know encourage you

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,040
to go

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,680
see that talk but i will also tell you

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,480
at its

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,120
core risk five was developed from the

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,000
start

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,519
as an open isa it came out of berkeley

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,680
with no commercial interest in it

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,000
whatsoever with the mandate that it'd be

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,040
open and freely available to all from

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,120
the start

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
it has it was not grown inside a

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,959
corporation with a

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,120
you know very clear vested interest in

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,160
its success but it has been grown by a

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,600
community

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,640
much more akin to how linux was grown

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,760
linux was contributed very early on

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,200
with the intent of being an open uh

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,320
an open software and that is also true

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,120
of risk five

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
so that fundamental start means that it

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,839
is an

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,000
entire community that is invested in its

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,560
success

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,880
similar to raspberry pi are there some

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,360
good evaluation kits or boards with

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,480
real uh to build real projects with

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,839
absolutely

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,880
in fact if you go to our website ris

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,880
cv dot org five risk5.org

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,079
you will see something called exchange

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,560
in exchange we

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,320
have many different developer boards

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
that have come together

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,399
we have boards with spark fund boards

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
that many of our members have

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,079
collaborated together on

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,480
you see boards from microchip so many

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,360
different developer kits are available

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,920
in addition

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,920
on our website you'll also find open

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,360
course proprietary cores

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,519
socs and many other tools design

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
tools software what software runs on

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,320
risk fund

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,120
we list it all there and there are

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,600
hundreds of available resources

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
in that exchange area and we're always

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,560
looking for more

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,160
if you know one that hasn't been listed

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,160
yet please let us know we're trying to

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,200
keep up with the rapid growth in our

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,120
in our community uh from ian

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
what with the current climate can you

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,959
still cooperate with chinese companies

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,959
huawei did some great work with armed

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,720
cpus but seems like they can't continue

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,760
along that track i know it's political

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,120
but their work

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,360
group could do a great job

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,079
uh ian thanks for the question you know

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,279
uh open source has long been held as

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,200
a uh you know a technology is

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,959
owned by the community and our community

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,560
is truly global

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,639
we don't have roadblocks up when

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,519
something is uh contributed to open

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,399
source that is

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,480
true of all open source so from a

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,360
technical or political or licensing

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
perspective

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,399
there are no hurdles like that in fact

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,440
huawei has been

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,120
a great participant and leader in the

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,200
risk five community

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
and they are continuing to do so today

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,040
in fact that is true of

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,120
many of our members who are coming from

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,200
china as i mentioned earlier

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,320
alibaba has been another leader in our

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,240
community

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,519
we also work closely with rios rios is a

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,079
development institute that is centered

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,639
in both

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,680
berkeley and chiang wang university and

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,959
shenzhen

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,360
and so you know we we see a diversity of

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,720
interest from both research and academia

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,040
and industry

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,519
and venture capital going on around the

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,839
world and that is including china

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,240
so that in the current climate we

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,120
absolutely are cooperating and working

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,360
together

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,279
uh you know one of our our key things

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,480
around open source is to work with

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,720
transparency

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,760
so our member work groups have absolute

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,079
transparency

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,200
uh broadly and publicly about our

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,160
activities

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
and is as is common in most open source

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,760
communities

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,240
we're not there to share technical uh

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,279
confidential technical information so we

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,760
are very clear

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,760
in our rules of the road rules of

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,560
engagement that are

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,320
we are not there to share uh

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,000
confidential information that would

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,560
otherwise be subject to

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,800
export control or any other regulations

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,720
from different countries

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,160
what is the roadmap for compliance the

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
point where risk five international

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,360
would start certifying implementations

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,160
we are on that roadmap now uh about a

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,880
year ago

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,440
in uh well close to a year ago it will

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,519
be in

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,440
in december we released our first test

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,680
suite and we have continued to

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,079
cultivate and grow and build tests since

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
then we have members who are offering

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,480
compliance

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,680
uh uh test suites as well as and working

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,639
with many of the

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,440
usual silicon tool providers and design

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,079
shops

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,320
uh so we are working towards a

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,880
compliance uh certification

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
uh and we're probably going to call it

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,839
compatibility

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,720
because isas is just one building block

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,839
of an entire set of things and we will

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,519
build on that to

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,199
establish different profiles and

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,880
different other types of stacks that

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,000
would be useful

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,680
to our community most of the licensing

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,399
costs and proprietary lock-in

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,240
on socs is not related to the isa but

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,040
the peripherals and accelerators around

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
the cpu

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,360
does risk five have a plan to address

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
this yeah you know actually i kind of

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
just um

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,959
sneak peek that one uh you know as we

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
build out profiles and different

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,199
implementation

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,360
you know key implementation styles uh

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,560
that is where you're going to see those

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
types of uh

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,079
compliance that we would you know adhere

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,839
to

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,320
but we are not uh at the soc level

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,760
we are building uh we are composing

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,399
building blocks so that

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,000
any implementer can pull those together

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,000
and still be compliant to that base

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,199
isa and that is fundamentally the most

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,920
important

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,440
so whether it's a microcontroller or a

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,880
full soc

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,800
those are things that we're working

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,040
towards

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,639
there are many extensions now and more

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
being discussed or worked out so two

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,800
questions here

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,959
how are you going to deal with

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,720
compatibility and interoperability okay

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,040
that's around our compliance and

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
and uh compatibility and and some of the

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,600
testing that

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,279
we're going to be offering rolling out

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,639
and i think you'll see something in the

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,360
in the next six to nine months on that

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,800
how all that zoo of configuration is

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,079
going to be verified

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,360
on both w and sw front

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,600
so uh those are those configurations as

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,320
i mentioned are around profiles and

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
and other implementation desired stacks

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,959
and that's what you're going to see

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,079
coming through in

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,480
and can we get the slides

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,440
well i haven't shown any slides but we

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,440
have a ton of artifacts so if you visit

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,639
our uh risk five um

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,600
booth at this event you can certainly

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,000
uh get full keynotes you can get slides

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,040
you can get other technical talks

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,639
uh that have been online uh we have a

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,240
full listing of what the

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,160
uh of what those technical talks are and

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,800
other aspects that are live in this

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,120
event

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,120
and we also have a youtube channel uh

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,240
and so if you visit our website you're

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
going to see

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,839
you know documentation lots of technical

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,519
documentation lots of talks lots of uh

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,279
you know kind of forums where you can

you know we're running a little bit

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,240
short on time here it feels like a speed

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,840
session for us today

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,679
uh let's see has risk five not caught on

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,600
popular areas like phones and wearable

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,280
devices we actually have wearables out

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,480
there there have been uh health

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
monitoring uh

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,200
types of devices we have risk five

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,280
showing up in headlamps of uh

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,720
automobiles we have you know many of the

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,520
large mobile phone companies looking at

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,640
risk five

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,559
for various implementations and i think

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,039
you're going to see that coming out soon

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,360
however understand that a rip and

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,880
replace of a legacy architecture is a

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,360
very difficult business case

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,919
conversation to have have within your

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,840
your company so we see most of the

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,160
growth going down in the new workloads

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,559
and

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,559
advancing those further whether it's

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,640
cloud providers with massive data

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,640
centers who are looking at risk five for

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,840
their future and their growth in those

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,840
uh new areas or it's a phone provider

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,440
who is looking at risk five

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,039
for future generations i think those

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,320
are most of the questions that we can

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,559
tackle today

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,160
