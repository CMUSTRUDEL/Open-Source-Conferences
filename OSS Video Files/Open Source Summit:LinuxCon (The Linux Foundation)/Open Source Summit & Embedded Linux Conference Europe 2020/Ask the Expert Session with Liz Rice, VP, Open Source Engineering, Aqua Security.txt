okay so this is slightly weird i

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,160
feel like i'm talking into

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,960
space um all right so

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,760
i'm liz rice i look after open source

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,119
engineering at aqua security

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,800
and i am uh the author of

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,000
a book about container security and

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,599
uh i am currently the chair of the

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,880
technical oversight committee

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,520
at the cncf and

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,760
uh despite my extensive technical

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,640
qualifications it took me a little while

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,200
to figure out how to get this

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,920
session to work but i think it's i

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,440
believe it's working now so that's good

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,879
all right okay so

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,120
now i can find the q a button and my

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,800
impression is that if you have questions

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,760
you'd like me to

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,160
answer you can put them into that q a

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
session

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,240
all right i hope everyone is uh

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,560
coping with this platform better than i

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,439
seem to be i think i'm okay now right

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,040
okay so i have a question uh what's the

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,080
best thing i can do to make my

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,439
containers secure

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
this is the kind of thing that i could

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,159
talk about all day

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,360
um say there are lots of

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,200
different stages to the

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,880
container life cycle and there are

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,159
things that you can do to improve

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,759
security

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,360
all the way through the life cycle

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,600
but i would say if if you

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,079
only had to do one thing i would

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,200
recommend scanning container images

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,280
for known vulnerabilities there are

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,799
plenty of vulnerability scanners

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,240
available out there

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,000
and you know some of them are commercial

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,840
products but there are several free

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,320
and open source options um open source

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
uh container image scanners include

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,360
trevi from my team

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,120
uh ancor have a solution there's claire

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,080
so there are a few different options

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,440
and if you use a container image scanner

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,640
you

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:25,680
will pick up when your images contain

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,680
known serious vulnerabilities

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,280
so um that prevents you from deploying

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,360
something that

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,599
is known to be very insecure

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,000
so because it's so simple to build

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,440
something like that into your

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,760
ci cd pipeline that is

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,879
a high bang per buck it's very easy to

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,599
do and

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,000
it makes your deployment much more

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,239
likely

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,239
to be secure

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,519
so i hope that answered the

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,400
the question um i could talk about some

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,480
other ideas for things that you can do

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,560
to secure your containers

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,959
um not running as roots so i'm about to

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,040
do a talk i actually pre-recorded the

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,120
talk but very shortly

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,879
my talk will be going out about rootless

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,920
containers

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,280
and most of the time as you'll see in

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,400
that talk

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,599
by default people run containers as

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,280
roots that's the kind of default

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,640
setting if you like and root inside the

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,360
container is the same

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,360
as root on the host so

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,319
if there were to be a container escape

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,440
if somehow a container got compromised

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,159
and someone was able to escape from that

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
container

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,319
perhaps there's a vulnerability in the

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,840
container runtime itself we've seen a

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,760
few of those

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,400
if something like to happen i don't want

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,920
to scare anybody but if it does happen

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
if you're running as route inside the

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,439
container you escape the container

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,560
you are root on the host this is a bad

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,159
that's a bad situation so that's kind of

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,680
game over for your

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:18,079
uh your security on that host

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,079
so the

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
the fact that you're running as root is

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,600
something you want to avoid

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,280
rootless containers is one option

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,560
configuring a user

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,440
so in your dockerfile setting a user id

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
or in your yaml as you're configuring

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,120
your

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
pods you can define a user id that you

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,000
want to run under

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,479
make it non-root that will be more

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,479
secure

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
uh what do i love about working in open

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,639
source that's pretty cool

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,440
uh pretty cool question so i think the

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
thing that i like

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,000
best about open source is the feeling

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
that you're

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,040
interacting with people from kind of all

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
around the planet

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,639
people that you you've never met get

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,000
some

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,720
value something out of something that

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
you've built

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
and then they get in touch or they

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,600
contribute to your project and they give

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
you

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,960
um you know the the the benefit of their

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,639
their wisdom on their time

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,120
and that's super um

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,720
rewarding i think that the fact that you

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,080
interact with people and you feel like

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,039
you've given them something or they've

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,479
given you something

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,160
and um and it's uh you know

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,759
everybody is raising each other's game i

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
think that's probably the thing i like

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,280
best about open source plus everybody

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,560
always seems to be so friendly and and

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,080
welcoming you know

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,280
i'm missing meeting people in real life

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,720
at events and meetups and so on so i'm

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
looking forward to getting back to that

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,199
when

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,960
when things get a bit more back to

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,680
normal

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,720
uh oh very nice question here

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,039
uh complimenting me on my keynote

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
yesterday thank you

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,440
uh looks like i work on a lot of great

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,479
things any advice for retaining work and

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,479
life balance um

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,680
gotta say that's probably something i

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,280
wouldn't consider myself

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,479
brilliant at um because i i do have a

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
bit of a tendency to

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,479
commit to slightly too many things and

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,680
but i do

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,800
i do carve out time and

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,199
you know i i spend quite a lot of time

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,840
doing

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
um doing sport doing training and i kind

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,720
of

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,120
set aside time and and try very hard not

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,720
to let anything encroach on that

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
my husband's very good at making sure i

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
eat regularly which is

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
probably a very good thing um yeah i

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,479
think

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,120
maybe setting boundaries around the time

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,080
you know i try very hard to avoid

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,319
making a regular commitment to evening

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,360
meetings because

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,080
you know i think it would be all too

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,919
easy to fall into a world where you know

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
your day stretches from

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,080
eight in the morning till 11 at night

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,240
and i don't think that is a

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,199
you know a long-term path to success so

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,880
i'm pretty protective of my out of hours

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,680
time unless there's a really strong

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,680
reason to to do something out of hours

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,720
um technical question again okay are

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,599
there some containers that have to

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,840
run as roots and and there's an example

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,240
of

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,440
needing to open a low numbered port so

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,759
um

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,960
yeah there's a lot of software that has

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
been containerized

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,479
that was originally written in the era

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,520
before

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,240
containers designed to run on a host

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,440
and normally if you want to open a low

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,919
numbered ports

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,199
you need privileges to do that and those

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,800
privileges come if you

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,840
run as a route so

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,759
you would typically run

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,879
a web server for example or load

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,120
balancer

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,440
you you would typically run that as a

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,800
privileged user because you needed the

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,840
privileges on the host

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,319
to open the loan and report

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,199
if you're running inside a container

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,319
that is

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,240
less less of an issue because you can

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
you have port mapping you can

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,919
your code can be running thinking it's

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,400
talking on port 80

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,840
but that could be mapped to any port

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,360
outside of the

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,599
of the container so that's

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,120
no longer a good reason to have to run

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,479
as route

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,639
so although a lot of software

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,399
expects that it needs to run as root it

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,839
can usually be

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,000
reconfigured to run on a different port

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,760
and there are um some collections of

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,919
container images

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,080
for example bitnami did a lot of work to

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,959
create

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,440
versions of well-known popular images

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,720
that can run as non-root software

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,880
so although you may find

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,720
a lot of official images that do expect

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,320
to run this route there's usually a way

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,640
that with a bit of work

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,600
you can find a a way to run

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
as a non-root user

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,360
um okay

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
along with aqua you work closely with

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,160
the cncf what types of things do you

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,839
work on with them

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,480
yes so i um mostly the the work that i'm

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
doing with the

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
cncf right now is with the technical

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,519
oversight committee

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,080
where we are with a group that sets the

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,240
technical direction for the foundation

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,720
in practice a lot of what we're doing is

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,240
assessing projects that want to join

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,959
um and in practice in order to assess

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,480
projects

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,800
or help them move up the maturity

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,240
scale from sandbox to incubation to

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,399
graduation

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
and we actually spend quite a lot of

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,959
time thinking about the criteria

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,680
of what it means to be a graduated

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,040
project

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,240
and trying to figure out how we can

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,120
scale those assessments and judgments

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,040
um we have a lot of projects that want

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,360
to join which is fantastic

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
but we're a you know group of volunteers

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,680
with day jobs as well

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,760
so um we recently

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,440
well over the last year or year and a

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,000
bit set up

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
um special interest groups within the

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,480
cncf that can

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,680
help the toc so we can ask these special

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,880
interest groups in

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,959
say storage or security to help us with

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,160
some of the technical assessment in

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,320
particular projects and that helps us

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,279
kind of share the workload which is

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,279
really helpful

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,519
um is helping run an open source project

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,000
different uh easier harder than leading

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,320
inside a big company like aqua

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
um so aqua's not that big we're about

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
300 people so

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,040
i mean it's not tiny but it's not like

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,490
an enormous

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,200
corporation uh

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,480
[Music]

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,279
i think

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,640
i think that this it's very different i

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,880
think if you're

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,079
uh inside a company a company will have

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,320
particular

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,880
um you know commercial goals typically

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,200
and and defining those goals

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,959
kind of top down yeah i think that's

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,040
usually the way that most

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,560
companies operate you know sort of have

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,040
a top level goal and then that

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:28,079
rolls out into goals and kpis for

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
teams and individuals i think in open

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,560
source while you do

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,279
still have collective goals it's less

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
um it's much more collaborative and much

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,240
more kind of

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,000
um you know nobody's really going to get

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,839
into a huge amount of trouble

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,839
it's more about um

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,320
trying to find cooperative ways where

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,399
everybody gets something out of the

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,680
contributions that they're making

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,279
so um i i like to think that internally

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,120
in a in a company that's also my

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,880
management style that i'm not kind of

00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
cracking some kind of whip and trying to

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,519
get people to

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,120
do so i hope that you know but

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
if we have a group of rational people

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,720
and we all talk about what we want to

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,800
achieve we will come up with a sensible

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,440
way to achieve that

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,920
together with our skills so in that

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
sense

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,600
i like to think that you can manage

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
in a commercial organization in a

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,959
similar way to

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,720
what you do in open source but at the

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,279
end of the day it is slightly different

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
in that

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,720
you you have these kind of

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,120
the different incentives and the

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,800
different um

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
uh goals that you're ultimately trying

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,000
to achieve they can be complimentary

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,720
though and i'm lucky

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,360
that i work for a company that allows me

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,880
to spend time on open source and values

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,320
the work that we're doing and

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,839
we do it in a way that we you know is

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,839
complementary to what

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
we're doing as a commercial organization

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:02,639
how did i get involved in open source um

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,360
so kind of almost by accident i think

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,800
and i actually remember years and years

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,480
and years ago when i first came across

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,160
open source being quite dismissive about

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,760
the whole idea because i thought well

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,200
how on earth can

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,760
a team of volunteers possibly

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,279
do a kind of real professional job and

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
you know why would they bother doing

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,560
things like testing and you know surely

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,000
they're just banging out code and they

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,680
don't really care what happens

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,880
of course that's not true you know over

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,639
time i realized that that's not true

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,920
but that perception years ago put me off

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:40,079
for a while um and but

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,760
the way i got involved was um

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,800
really uh working with startups i spent

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,839
a few years

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,240
um working in and co-founding startups

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,480
that

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,760
basically failed but we've learnt a lot

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,959
along the way

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,600
and and in a startup you're constantly

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,600
trying to show

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,040
people what you're doing and i learned

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,160
that i really liked

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,839
kind of presenting things and

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
my sort of engineer inside me wanted to

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,800
show

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,360
people technical things and i realized

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
that

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,199
you know there was this huge community

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,800
of people who were interested in having

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
these sort of technical conversations

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,680
that you could

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,199
show them a thing and they'd go that's

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,959
really interesting

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,680
let me tell you about what i've done

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,760
that's related and

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,360
that kind of sucked me in so it was more

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,480
through the kind of community

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,680
events presenting that i got involved in

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:37,839
the world of open source and that

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,160
made me take the whole um

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,120
the way that open source projects work

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,279
much more

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,040
seriously and i got much more interested

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
in it and ended up

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,160
you know making that kind of the focus

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
of what i do as a job

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,240
uh can i talk about kubernetes security

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,680
posture management

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,880
so um yeah this is really

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:07,120
it relates to um

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,120
i think it's garner have a um

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,720
what they call it a term for called um

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,480
cloud security posture management

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,440
which is the idea that when you set up

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,880
your

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
cloud infrastructure

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,360
you need to there are some best

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,519
practices you really should be

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,279
applying like you know putting

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,199
permissions on your

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,720
storage so that not everybody on the

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,639
whole internet can just go and look at

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,639
your data

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,759
you know making sure that you're you

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,079
have

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,720
multi-factor authentication setup so

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,639
that you um

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,759
you know to secure access to your

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,000
console

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,839
and cspm cloud postures

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
cloud security posture management is

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,000
about tools that

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,399
check that you're applying those sort of

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,440
sensible security practices

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,360
so kspm is applying that similar

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,959
thinking to kubernetes

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,639
and saying what are the sensible

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,000
settings you should apply

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,320
not just to your kubernetes

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,399
configuration but also to

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
the way that you're running your

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,399
containerized workloads in kubernetes

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,320
how can you configure them

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,360
in a way that's secure and kspm

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,759
tooling is really assessing your yaml

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,240
files your configuration and saying

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,800
is it applying these security best

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,800
practices

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,680
what do i enjoy working on the most um

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,680
um

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,199
i'm a bit torn there between i mean i

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,759
really really really like

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:57,440
creating kind of content explanations

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,600
typically talks and

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,839
getting the sense that somebody has

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,000
understood something because i

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,280
because of the way i explained it and

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
when that lands when i

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,559
when you know when somebody comes and

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,160
tells me that they

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,919
figured out how containers work you know

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,600
they understood it because they saw one

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,039
of my talks i think that is the thing

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,439
that i

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,839
find most rewarding um it's it's

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,839
definitely

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,880
it's definitely that kind of sense of

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,160
achievement when you feel like you've

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,959
done something and other people

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,959
appreciated it

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,320
in projects that you've worked on do you

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:37,280
have any what not to do lessons oh

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,280
um how long have we got um

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,919
i think so the first thing i would say

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,360
when i first got involved in open source

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
was

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,480
you know worrying too much about

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,280
perfection and and

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,960
thinking that you know if i put code out

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,960
people would look at it and

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,400
you know find all the flaws and think

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,760
that i was a terrible engineer

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,840
and in practice

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,799
anything you can publish people don't

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,600
really pore

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,799
over it in in very great detail but also

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,880
you know everybody

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,320
who's ever written any code knows what

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
it's like to

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,840
you know improve it and that it never

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
really feels completely finished and

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,160
that you're always wanting to make it

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,120
better

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,799
so i think getting over that idea that

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,160
you

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,080
you know that it's not good enough it is

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,320
good enough ship it

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,600
get it out into the into the world and

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,160
see whether or not

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
you know how people react to it that

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,520
would be

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,000
so that what not to do would be don't

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,320
kind of

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,760
hide your code and you know try and

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,240
polish it too much before you show

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,360
people

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,280
get feedback early um

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,520
i think another thing that we're

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,799
learning about a lot in our own

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,320
projects in aqua is trying to figure out

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,919
the

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,919
the way to um

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,720
kind of be helpful and welcoming to

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,240
community members there's been a lot of

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,640
great talks about that

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,600
today and and you know and other events

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,200
in the past

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,039
where we you know we talk a lot about

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,679
community and making

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,120
projects accessible for people to help

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,400
out and get involved

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,160
and actually the reality day-to-day is

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,760
oh my god there's so many things coming

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
in on github and how can we

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,960
how can we answer them all and how can

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,640
we make sure people aren't

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,919
you know frustrated because we haven't

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,720
responded to them in a timely fashion

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,440
i think that balance making sure that

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,679
we're

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,799
kind of doing work and also responding

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,480
to

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,679
other people's work in a timely fashion

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,160
i feel like that's something that i'm

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,280
still trying to get to grips with what

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,280
the right balance is there

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,760
uh okay i think

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,440
uh we are pretty much through all the

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,960
questions thank you very much everyone

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,480

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,559
appreciate that um

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,039
