okay so i just have a few slides

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,400
and then um wanted to mostly focus on uh

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,120
people's questions uh really would like

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
to hear

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,720
after you know all this time with agl

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
what are your suggestions for what we

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,279
could improve on hgl because that's

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,720
really

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,720
what we want to focus on is the

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,160
developer experience and how we can make

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,279
your life easier

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,880
um so just a quick overview

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,640
most of you should already know this

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,680
where agl is you know

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,160
collaborating to develop the uh car of

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,040
the future through rapid innovation

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,239
we are hosted at the linux foundation

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
myself

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,480
uh i'm walt miner i'm the community

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
manager john simon you can see him as

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,680
well he's the

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,920
release manager and we both are

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,360
employees of the linux foundation

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,960
um totally open source software

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,840
everything we do is completely in the

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
open

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,120
um all these slides by the way

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
should already be posted i posted them

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,879
on sked

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,080
uh just before the uh the session

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,600
started here

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,159
so we have 11 oem supporting

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,640
agl at the moment including most of the

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,560
major japanese manufacturers

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,400
uh including um you know toyota mazda

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,880
honda subaru suzuki mitsubishi

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,520
we have european manufacturers like

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,040
mercedes-benz and volkswagen

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
and um we have uh you know ford here in

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
the us

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,320
and we're always and we have we even

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,520
have a chinese manufacturer saic

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,439
so a pretty good variety of different

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,920
manufacturers who are participating in

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,920
agl

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
we have

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,479
a total of 155 member companies

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,159
this might even be a little out of date

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,200
since i got this slide

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,840
um but again we're we're signing up

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
members at

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,200
quite a good rate this year even despite

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,200
the

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:12,319
uh covet epidemic

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,959
and we're focusing on all of the vehicle

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,760
in the car

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,400
um as we like to say if there's linux in

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,680
the vehicle

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,599
it should be it should be running agl so

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,800
infotainment was our our original

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,000
um our original product

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,680
original profile that we worked on

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,519
now we've been focusing on instrument

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,160
cluster but we're adding things like

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,560
tell we've added telematics uh head up

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,120
display with the sandcloud board

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,959
and we're working with alisa on

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
functional safety

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,319
and eventually we'll add adas and

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,840
hopefully autonomous driving to our

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,840
portfolio of software

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
come on so we have the

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,319
agl unified code base which is what

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,159
everybody should be using

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,360
basically a single open source software

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,560
platform

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,599
for the entire industry um we aim to

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
provide at least

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,920
70 of the base platform for production

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
projects

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,920
and really our goal over the last you

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
know five or six years that i've been

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,720
involved

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,120
is um cultivating an ecosystem of

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,319
developers and suppliers and automotive

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,400
expertise

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,760
using open source and using this single

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
platform

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,360
and our goal has been to make uh create

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,080
a reference hard

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
create reference hardware and software

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,400
and

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:47,840
applications that are available for the

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:47,840
entire community

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,680
so just a quick overview of our schedule

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,920
this year we released um beginning of

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,040
the year we released our 9.0 release

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,200
itchy ice fish uh in september last

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,640
month we released 10.00 jumping

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,000
jellyfish

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,519
we are now working on kooky koi

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,959
and i've got a few more detailed slides

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
about those schedules

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
in a second here

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,400
so the ucb for jumping jellyfish which

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
was 10.00 which was released in

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,079
september

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,079
um

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,240
oh my keeps doing this we um we up rev

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:36,160
to uh the yakdo 3 3.1 which is the long

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
term support version of yakdo

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,560
we basically we updated the window

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,479
manager compositor

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,400
and home screen um and we all

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,000
that was all done to match the uh the

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,199
demo feature set that we had

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
at ces last year or the earlier this

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,320
year rather

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,520
we had other new features that were

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,240
driven by uh

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,560
gap analysis and member donations um

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,720
we extended some of the existing agl

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,039
binders we

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,080
created some new test plans and our our

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,000
ciaf group continues to add

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,000
to the test infrastructure

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,440
so for jellyfish

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,919
we basically we worked throughout the

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,639
year we did the final release

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:33,759
in september but should be filled in um

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,039
it's already out available and we're

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
working on

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,440
a uh the first packed release we're

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,360
working on for

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,360
for next month for november

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,320
for kooky koi so the plan is

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,400
we'll uh continue with yocto 3.1 the

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,000
long-term support version

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,919
right now we plan to continue with that

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
for you know at least the two-year life

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,199
cycle but you know we'll continue to

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,479
revisit that

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,360
but that's the plan for now um we'll be

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,280
adding

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,199
features like uh instrument cluster

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,960
containers which is something our

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
instrument cluster expert group has been

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,919
working on

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,919
and i'll talk about the expert groups in

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,000
a second but the instrument cluster

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,360
expert group is working on

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
uh creating a um uh

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
creating a production ready or close to

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,600
production ready version

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,000
of an instrument cluster that is also um

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,360
functional you know acyl b functional

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,400
safety ready

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,160
by the end of next year

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,840
um our virtualization expert group is

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,880
working on virtio

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,039
and then uh denzo is contributing

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,720
something called rules-based arbitration

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,360
for the user interface that we also hope

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
to get in

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
for cookie coy

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,759
so the schedule for koi um

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
right now or this this schedule was

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,400
originally created around

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,199
the idea that we would be attending uh

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,440
ces

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,720
in january obviously that's not

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,319
happening um

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,800
ces has been is now virtual only um

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
so but we're gonna basically we'll stick

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,280
with this schedule with the final

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:30,800
release in the

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:34,080
february time frame february 12th

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,599
and then patch updates next year

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,560
so just wanted to touch on the expert

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,639
groups so

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
in terms of developers um probably that

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,080
you know there's

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,840
there are several ways to get involved

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,520
i've got some slides coming up

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,960
on developer resources such as how you

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
know meetings

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,520
and you know documentation website

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,960
things like that where to get the code

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,960
but really you know if there's a

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,759
particular area of interest that you

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
have

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,879
the best way to get involved is to

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
participate in one of these

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,440
expert groups and um

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,199
i like to say you don't need to be an

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,199
expert to participate in our expert

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,360
groups um

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,120
you just need to be willing to uh you

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,840
know work on these areas have some

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,919
knowledge

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,599
is is great but even if you're just

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
looking to learn something new

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,360
uh participating in the expert groups is

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
a is a great thing

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,720
this is the list of currently active

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,560
expert groups and

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:36,080
if you go um later on i'll have uh

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,680
some links to our groups.io page into

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
our wiki page and you can

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,120
find out when the when the meetings are

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,040
for each of these groups

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,680
they meet every other week um

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,800
they each have an active page on the

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,880
wiki page and

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,560
in some cases on confluence for

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,000
documenting requirements

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
and meeting minutes and what they're

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,120
working on

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,200
the virtualization expert group is

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,160
what's for focusing on the virtio use

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,959
case

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,680
um continuous integration automated

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,120
tests they're

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,600
they're doing all the work with our

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,360
test infrastructure with jenkins and

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
lava

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
you know and everything that's

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,800
associated with that john simon's also

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,160
looking at how do we integrate

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,760
um foss tools and

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,120
uh like he gave a presentation on

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,360
yesterday as well as possibly some um

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
static analysis tools into the ci loop

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
um instrument cluster is very very oops

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
sorry

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
shouldn't have done that i want to go

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,240
back

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,680
instrument cluster is very very active

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,959
looking at creating that

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,880
instrument cluster reference um and

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,959
to complement that we've got an ivi

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,760
expert group that's forming

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,839
uh to focus on adding some more

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
production ready features to the ibi

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,800
profile

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,560
and that's something that we just

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,880
we're just we're just in the process of

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,800
forming we're thinking toyota will be

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,360
leading that expert group

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,279
suzuki currently leads the instrument

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,040
cluster expert group

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,480
um so i think you know just in general

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
as a developer it's probably the best

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
way

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,320
to get involved in a particular area

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,320
that you might be interested in

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,000
the other so here's i this is again i

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,560
uploaded all these slides already to

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
sched

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,399
so you can see our wiki page our

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,000
documentation site

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,920
there's a getting started guide both on

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,560
the documentation site and on the wiki

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,720
page

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,600
i think the documentation site i should

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,880
link to

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
now instead of the wiki

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,600
we've got pre-built binaries and source

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,959
tar balls

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,519
our release notes are on the wiki page

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,839
um garrett and git are available we use

00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:01,839
garrett for our code for code review

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,839
and we've got a git mirror as well

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,839
we have every tuesday except for today

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,800
we didn't have one because of uh

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,560
elce here we have a developer call so

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,079
anybody can call in

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,720
uh if you have a question about how to

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,079
do something uh you can either ask it on

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,360
the mailing list

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,000
you can ask it on irc or on irc

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,279
um or you can call into the dev call and

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
we'll try to get you the help that you

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,839
need

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
and then we typically in addition to

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
that

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,040
again we try to have uh regular

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,560
face-to-face meetings

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,320
among the developers um typically in a

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
more typical year we would try to do

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,079
something every

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,959
about every two months six weeks to two

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,360
months

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,959
um you can see this was what we did last

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,560
year

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,079
this year it's been a little more

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,920
limited uh

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,079
we had some events that were just uh

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
cancelled uh we had some face-to-faces

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,720
that were cancelled

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,639
but we have had a few virtual ones um

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
and we have another virtual face-to-face

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,519
meeting scheduled for december

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,360
7th through 9th so it's another

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,720
opportunity to participate

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,320
um on a larger scale with the developers

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,720
i think for the october one we had about

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,720
35 to 40 people participating

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,800
and that's really it i wanted to really

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,839
spend most of the time here

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,680
um uh answering your any questions

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,200
people have or discussing anything that

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,959
people might want to bring up

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,120
um so i don't know young simon were

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,680
there any questions that appeared in the

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
in the chat

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
no not so far so if not you can uh

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,279
unmute your mic

00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:07,839
and um ask a question or put it in the

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:07,839
chat here

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:26,639
or i can sing some really bad songs

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,639
hello hello rakesh

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,399
uh hi i have a question uh so it's a

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,200
general one uh so when you mean that uh

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,240
you are going to bring in a dash

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
capability

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,480
or let's say you already brought a

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
certain part of that into automotive

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,800
linux

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,959
um how is it uh let's say

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,399
uh how is the ai part coming into

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,600
picture here like

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
what are the developments that are

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,160
happening specifically to artificial

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
intelligence

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,399
really at this point we've more focused

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,680
on the sensor side

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,079
of adas and making and trying to provide

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,279
a

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,040
sensor framework and uh um vehicle

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,040
signaling architecture so that you could

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,160
combine sensor inputs

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,680
we've not really focused on the ai part

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,639
and how to bring that in

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,279
a lot of that our our oems are saying

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
are

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,480
proprietary and they're not really

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,639
willing to contribute that at this point

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
so like like any open source project

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,760
where we're reliant

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
you know so we're relying to a great

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
extent on what people

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,079
are willing to contribute and bring into

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,199
the into the project so

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,680
um at this point we've not seen a lot of

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,240
interest

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,920
from the car manufacturers to to bring

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,959
that into agl

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,839
but it's definitely something we're

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,839
hoping for

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,360
absolutely yeah thank you yeah no

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,360
well you're welcome thank you for the

00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
question

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,160
i'll just jump on there people have done

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,040
demos with the

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,560
uh i think i'm trying to number the name

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,199
of it there's a couple different open

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,279
source

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,800
stacks although i think both of them you

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,560
end up needing to

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,959
potentially play some games around

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,279
training data but uh

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,480
the baidu system i think i've seen demos

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,639
of running on top of

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,519
agl i forget the name of that one off

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,480
the top of my head

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,279
um in ntt data msc was showing some

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,519
things that

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,560
in some demos running on top of the gl

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,560
yeah i mean

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,079
if something runs on linux you can

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:41,519
pretty much easily

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:44,079
get it to work on top of agl so

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,079
yeah a lot of what we see people a lot

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,199
of applications you know that's more on

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,959
the application side

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,800
a lot of applications we see people

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,320
bringing to various

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
trade shows or ces and it's always

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,800
i it's always surprising to me to see

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,880
what people are running uh

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:09,839
on top of agl it's always interesting

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:09,839
and surprising to see that

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,959
anybody else have any uh questions how

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,160
they can participate

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,560
i'd like to open it up to also hear what

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,440
what could we um if you've been using

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,839
agl

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:37,839
what can we do to improve your life or

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:37,839
your experience as a developer

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
anybody

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
um

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
oops

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,320
and simon you have anything you want to

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,320
bring up while we're here

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,720
um well i i could ask what what hardware

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,640
people might be interested in

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,919
um so we have the uh

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,200
effort on imx8 uh

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,320
going on um so there is

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,120
uh support for that being contributed

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,640
and worked on

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,160
by by community members um

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,000
so we would like to hear uh if if any of

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,679
you have interest in that

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,919
or what other boards or platforms might

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,240
be interesting

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,240
to you

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,039
so we have just in general we have imx8

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,880
we have raspberry pi

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,880
we have renaissance support

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:43,520
intel both qmu

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:46,559
and up square and middleboard

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,600
yeah basically if you need to demo um

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,880
or want to check out agl

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,360
any touch screen laptop or anything

00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:02,640
x86 will will do for a quick try

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:11,840
raspberry pi 4 will work fine with hdmi

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:11,840
so that's easy to to try that

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,840
well this is gonna be a short session if

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,840
nobody has any more questions

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,120
it's a pretty generic question since i'm

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,240
pretty new to the whole project

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,720
but do you completely focus maybe

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,160
only on the devices or is there also

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,080
something like

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,919
interfacing vehicle for instance from

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,679
the cloud and especially

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,679
having a common abstraction layer for

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,360
that on how to access data from the

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,640
vehicles or is it out of scope for your

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,039
project

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,039
so uh we do have okay there's there's

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,760
two parts to that question so we do have

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,760
um

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,039
a vehicle signal manager and a can

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,080
interface

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,960
um so and there's been a lot of work

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,480
around around that so there's so you can

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,400
access the vehicle you can access the

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,440
vehicle data through can

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,720
um and some guys at roy lingan

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,559
university

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
have been integrating that more and more

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,400
into their car simulator

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
and trying to build out some more of the

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,200
generic

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,080
infrastructure around that um

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,120
and then we have a vehicle the cloud and

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,679
that's being done through our

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,400
connectivity expert group if i go to the

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,200
if i want to go back to the group slides

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,120
um

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,919
and then we have a vehicle the cloud

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,720
expert group that's been focusing on the

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,280
how to get that data up into the cloud

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,400
for

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,400
for analysis and that's been led by um

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,760
forgerock um and they've done

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,520
so some companies that have done some

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,720
work with plug-ins

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,000
for um for aws

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,640
and for azer cloud to get the data up

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
there

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,679
so there they've been working on the

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,400
generic interface there

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,880
on that side so there are plenty of

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,480
pieces

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,159
already available in agl for that um

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,640
and of course that's that's an area that

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,360
we continually like to uh

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,360
to build up on

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,520
there's a question from jan luber in the

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,360
chat window

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,400
so it says i see the release knows that

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,960
you are now using it away from imx6

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,400
uh how's your experience with that and

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,400
are you also using it on imx8

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:48,000
it's probably a question for scott yeah

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,400
uh well for six it just kind of

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
happened uh i mean i had done work in

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,600
the previous

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,440
uh i guess the last couple releases

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,120
where i was explicitly

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,200
configuring to build with that navy for

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,000
the imax 6 boards that are

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,440
community supported just because it i

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,440
mean at this point it

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,960
the consensus is it works at least as

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,720
well or better

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,799
than vivante on those um on the eight

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,480
initially when i did some work there's

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,520
some worse than community people trying

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,120
to get

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,000
uh one of the nxp bsp layers working

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,960
um they weren't having huge success uh

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,360
so i kind of

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,320
rigged up something with vivante for the

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,600
first go around

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,159
because that was more straightforward

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,520
uh but then once we upgraded to dunfeld

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,240
that navy became

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,240
more doable uh then there were new

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,320
enough bits in uh

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,720
in the various layers so the uh

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,520
at least initially we were i was seeing

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,520
some issues

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,640
and i think one of the the community

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,760
members that was playing with it we're

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,960
seeing some issues with

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,080
with that navy but uh the

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,880
walter lauzon lozano

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,280
from uh calabra did some work there were

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,520
a couple things missing in the 5-4

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,840
stable kernel that were needed to get an

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,720
eve kind of working well on the at least

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,360
on the

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,039
particular uh the board that we're sort

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,600
of focusing on at the moment for the

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:19,760
community support which is the uh

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,159
the uh imxa mq the evk board

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,000
uh so at least for me i haven't done a

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,600
huge amount of testing on it i

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,960
just kind of do light support for it um

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,039
it's i think now uh at least with on

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,880
on the five four kernel with current

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,520
mezza and uh

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,960
wayland and weston the performance is in

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,799
the ballpark of avonte

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,720
there's a couple of times where now and

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,600
again i think maybe it's slightly slower

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,559
but

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,480
um it seems reasonable and i think it's

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,279
it would be usable in production if you

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,559
were

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,600
not in need of some of the other um

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,799
like video to code uh and

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,919
i think there's some stuff in uh vivante

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,360
for integrating with

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,840
uh a couple of the there's some hardware

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,960
like video uh processing unit stuff in

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,320
the

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,840
imx kernel that nxp sort of support that

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,159
i don't think there's anything upstream

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,039
for

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,760
yet so if you didn't need the fancier

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:21,039
things like that that are only in an xps

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,960
bsp um yeah and

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,279
enabled with vivante then i think you

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,440
could probably get by with that navive

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,799
um i don't think there's anybody from

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,720
collabora on the call i think

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,720
i got the impression they were doing a

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,200
bit more research

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,159
on that um when one walter was looking

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,520
at it a couple months ago

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,279
um but no it's it's it's reasonable um i

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,760
i mean at this point i think it's pretty

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,799
clear that i i'm x6 it's very

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,240
obviously uh you know

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,840
a good choice to use it uh i'm x8 i

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,760
think there's still enough

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,840
stuff i mean i we did have to patch a

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,600
couple of minor things to get it

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,640
working on the ebk um

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,520
but i think if you're running newer if

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,320
you're on like

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,080
upstream five you know eight or nine

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,240
kernel i think it's probably going to be

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,720
pretty straightforward so

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,919
um but yeah no i think it's it's

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,600
reasonable

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,720
um it would be nice to have maybe some

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,840
people who have other imx 8 hardware

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,200
jumped in and do other testing um the

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,840
the imx 8 mq ebk is is

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,559
about the only board that we have ready

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,039
access to

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,840
but i know there's a bunch of people out

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,200
there with uh

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,320
psalm based uh boards

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,200
there's quite a few different uh

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,360
psalms out from phi tech and and several

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,919
other companies that it would be

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,480
interesting to see some contributions on

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,520
getting

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,520
images built for them

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,640
so hopefully that answered your question

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,679
i think i now have my

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,120
microphone working so uh thanks for the

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,840
extensive answer is there a particular

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,760
imx

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,360
eight board you're looking at yan

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,840
um i was just uh interested in how your

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,080
experience with adnav is if

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,279
that matches what uh our experience is

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,960
or if there's anything

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,960
uh we've missed that causes your

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,799
problems

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,400
yeah i think the the only real issue

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,000
i've seen i mean it was

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,600
back last fall it was less obvious

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,320
of how to get it to work well on uh

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,120
on a like especially the amq i mean

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,760
there's

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,600
the nxp didn't do themselves any favors

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,720
because there's like

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,880
six different flavors of imxa and

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,400
there's i think three different gpus in

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,679
there so yeah

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
um you could say like i mean working on

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,440
like the

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,279
the mini the the mm was

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,520
lots of people could point at that

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,720
working but the 8mq was a lot more

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,360
do it yourself for quite a while and you

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,039
should

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,799
have been working earlier because that

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,679
was the first thing lucas had on this

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,440
desk

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:12,159
yeah i mean the thing with uh

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,600
that was mostly i mean our hands are a

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,520
little bit tied because we you know we

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,320
want to keep testing with the you know

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,679
a consistent set of layers in agl so we

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,320
were stuck on thud

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,799
up until you know early this year which

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,520
made it harder to pick and choose bits

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,840
i mean i had trees on you know here

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,760
locally where i had hacked up

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,240
you know backboarding several things and

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,720
i i think i did get it working quite a

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,919
bit

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,399
earlier before i pushed something to uh

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,440
like agl upstream just because it was

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,520
going to be a big

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,960
you know a bunch of changes the project

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,039
wouldn't want to carry for

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,880
any length of time so i mean it was

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,880
doable before but

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,799
once we went to dunfeld it was pretty

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,000
straightforward so

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,600
um so yeah i think today it's in a way

feel free to unmute your microphone or

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840

00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,840
into the chat window

it's an airplane

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,720
someone's got to have a question can i

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,679
ask the audience a question

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,159
sure since i see people from companies

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,399
that i

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,600
have a suspicion that they might have an

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,559
answer is

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,960
if you're already using a octo project

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,360
or

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:50,559
open embedded based linux system in a

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,559
vehicle environment

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,080
could you you know maybe either in the

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,120
chat or on mute and

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,919
give us a a little description of

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,520
um the reason why you wouldn't currently

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,880
be using agl

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:09,840
for that as opposed to your own in-house

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,840
custom distribution

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,279
if you want to say if not i'll uh

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,559
i can live with that and what could we

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,000
do to make

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,039
agl uh

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,840
closer to something you'd be um

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,840
interested in adopting

00:30:50,720 --> 00:31:05,840
that's worth a shot

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:19,840
okay anything else

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,960
well if there's nothing else i guess

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,799
we'll end this early um

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,320
or we'll just hang out and you can all

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,840

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,840
either way

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,200
all right well i guess we'll um we'll

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,919
wrap this up early then
