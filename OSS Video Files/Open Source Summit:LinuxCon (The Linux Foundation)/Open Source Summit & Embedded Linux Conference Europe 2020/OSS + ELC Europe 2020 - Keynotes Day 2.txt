a linux foundation project that supports

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,760
open source innovation

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,320
in the energy and electricity sectors

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,760
lf energy's ambition is to accelerate

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,080
the energy transition

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
and the decarbonization of the world's

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
economies

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,200
it's fitting that i'm coming to you here

right now today shulie goodman

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,680
will share more about lf energy the

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,720
electric

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,799
fake electrification of everything and

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,000
defining the future

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,840
of the grid please welcome

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,840
shulie goodman

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,159
hello and good afternoon it's a pleasure

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,520
to speak with you again

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,560
lf energy uh it was

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,200
born in europe and you are members

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
that have enabled us to come to life

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,079
this is our third open source summit

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
europe

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,560
uh in our short 18-month life the

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,119
european union has a

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,879
special role in driving the energy

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,480
transition

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,319
you recognize the importance of open

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,239
source you recognize the importance of

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:22,560
collective action

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:25,360
you are the power of together

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
before i go into the what and how of lf

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,959
energy

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
i want to speak first to the why of life

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,519
energy

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,879
at lf energy we are reimagining power

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,440
and energy we are building the digital

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,959
foundations for the grid of the future

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,879
we are using open source and

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
digitalization to accelerate the

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,920
transition to renewable energy

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
away from pumping fossils or the bones

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,200
of our ancestors into our cars

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,200
and our homes decarbonization is our

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,840
goal to restore climate balance and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,400
mitigate the worst of climate change

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,440
we are on a great adventure because

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,640
every hour

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,040
the sun provides enough power for us to

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,959
electrify the planet for a year

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,360
we just have to learn how to capture

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,920
that there's so much to learn

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,239
and so much will change in the next 30

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,080
years

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
i'm sorry to not be meeting you in

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
dublin this year

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,560
i've never been to ireland but i can

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,799
easily say that the poetry and music and

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,640
love of place and landscape of the irish

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,040
people is deep in my heart

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
so it has been a great disappointment to

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,319
not

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,799
be meeting you there maybe next year in

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,799
dublin

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,120
because of the irish roots of this

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,040
conference that was supposed to happen i

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,000
must speak to the why

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,640
because i believe that that that the

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,640
future

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
and all people who have strained under

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,799
the yoke of oppression

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,680
demand it they need to understand the

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,840
why

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,840
and as i talk through my slides i want

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,080
to bring in the words of an american

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,280
writer from the western lands

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
the place where i live the words of

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
terry

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,879
tempest williams haunt me she invites us

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,439
to live

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,560
into our better selves through speaking

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,799
truth

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,720
i invite you to meet me there in the

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,639
place of our better selves

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,919
so that we can create the future

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,199
together

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,199
in a piece titled a burning testament

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,800
that you can find if you search she

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,040
speaks with great wisdom

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,520
about the fires that have engulfed the

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,280
west this year

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,720
because grief is love and if nothing

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,600
2020 has brought most of us to our knees

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,160
even you stoic engineer types have

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
probably

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,199
found yourselves pushed past the point

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,199
you felt possible to endure

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,080
all of us have fallen to our knees with

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,120
the grief of what we have lost

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,080
and probably been woken up at night with

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
a deep fear

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,240
about what more we will lose without a

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,240
profound change and direction

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,639
that we can barely imagine 2020 is the

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,520
year

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,479
that we began to collectively reimagine

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,840
our future

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,160
it is time to grieve and mourn the dead

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,919
and the end of some chapter of human

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,720
experience

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,479
one that began nearly 150 years ago with

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,600
the advent of fossil fuel

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,000
and the internal combustion engine

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,080
a period that brings us to today when

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,479
the pollution from fossil fuel threatens

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,800
life

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,199
on earth what was is over

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
i do believe in the power of renewal and

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,479
redemption

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,039
and if you want to talk about power and

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,600
energy we have to talk about where we

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,560
came from because we have to reimagine

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,080
the future

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,280
from a different place we must reclaim

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,560
our energy and take back our power

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,840
and our grief is the doorway as terry

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,319
tempest williams says

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,960
if we do not embrace our grief our

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,360
sadness will come out sideways

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,479
in unexpected forms of depression and

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,520
violence

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,680
we must dare to find a proper ceremony

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,120
to collectively honor the dead from the

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,199
corona virus

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,280
as we approach 1.2 million lives lost

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,120
we must honor the lives engulfed in

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,600
these western fires

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,240
and the lives we will continue to lose

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,319
from the climate crisis at hand

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,680
only then can we begin the work of

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,800
restoration

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
respecting the generations to come as we

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,199
clear a path

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
toward cooling a warming planet this

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,680
will be

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:46,160
our joy this is the mission of lf energy

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
and it is truly a work of joy

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,919
we cannot breathe this is our mantra in

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,840
america now

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,840
and it is far more universal

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
terry says we cannot breathe because of

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,680
the smoke

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,599
we cannot breathe because of a virus

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
that has entered our homes

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,240
we cannot breathe because of police

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,520
brutality and too many black bodies dead

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
on the street

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,199
we cannot breathe because we are holding

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,880
our breath for the people

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,960
and places we love

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,880
this is the place that i love it's the

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,880
place that i call home

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,440
it's the view for my neighbor's house

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,560
looking north

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,520
this summer we have had two fires

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,080
one that was barely five miles away and

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,680
another

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,199
about a dozen miles they surrounded us

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:45,840
ash was everywhere smoke was everywhere

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,840
it was night during the day

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
terry tempest williams says we have been

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
living a myth

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,879
we have constructed a dream we have

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
cajoled and seduced ourselves into

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,120
believing

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,280
we are the center of all things with

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,759
plants and other sentient beings from

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,639
ants to lizards to coyotes and grizzly

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,440
bears

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,240
remaining subservient to our whims our

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,599
desires

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,919
and our needs this is a lethal lie

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,520
that will be seen by future generations

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,240
as a grave

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,160
as a grave moral sin committed and

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,599
buried in the name of ignorance and

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,319
arrogance

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,840
and so it is for future generations that

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
lf energy exists

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,800
she goes on the facts do not tell the

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,880
story of how our hearts are breaking nor

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,159
do the photographs of blackened forests

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,320
or lone chimneys

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
standing as monuments to homes once

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,919
inhabited

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,279
nor does the news speak to the terror of

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,440
fleeing fires

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,320
lapping at our heels that we can never

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,440
outrun

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,640
only pray for a change in the wind

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,120
and to this i say how has it become

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,480
that one person's tragedy has become my

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
good luck

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
that is no way to treat a neighbor nor a

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,399
life

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,000
yet this is the world that we occupy in

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,839
2020.

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
so to everyone i say if this is one

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,320
degree

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,320
i shudder to imagine two degrees

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,600
she says to the power of these burning

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
illuminated western lands who have

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,519
shaped our character

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,240
inspired our souls and restored our

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,360
belief in what is beautiful and enduring

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,040
i will never write your obituary

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,120
because even as you burn you are

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,839
throwing down seeds that will sprout

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
and flower trees will grow and forest

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
will rise again

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,440
as living testaments to how one survives

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,560
change

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,760
i say this is my hope out of the fires

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,480
will come life

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,279
out of coronavirus will come life

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,000
resilience

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,560
and a wisdom that this is how we survive

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
change

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,399
we survive change together she says

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,120
let this be a humble tribute an

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,680
exaltation an homage and an open-hearted

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,720
eulogy to all

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,880
who are lose we are losing in the floods

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,920
and the fires and the hurricanes and

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,399
tornadoes

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,839
and the invisible virus that has called

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,880
us all home

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,959
and brought us to our knees we are not

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,959
the only species that lives and loves

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,079
and breathes on this miraculous planet

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,519
called earth

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,399
may we remember this and raise a fistful

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,959
of ash

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,959
to all the lives lost that it holds

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,320
i will mark my heart with an axe x made

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,480
of ash that says the power to restore

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,040
life resides here

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
the future of our species will not be

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,399
will be decided here

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,720
not by facts but by love and loss

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,839
hand on my heart i pledge of allegiance

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,880
to the only home

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,160
i will ever know i say

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,640
this is why lf energy exists i cannot

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,920
act

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,480
like this is all normal i have to name

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,040
this is the time we find ourselves in

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,640
and i trust that in doing so we will

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,399
find our way through

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:13,680
because lf energy gives me so much hope

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,279
even in the despair i wake up i do the

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,480
work of lf energy

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:22,399
because it is where hope lives

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,399
and i want to give you that hope as well

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,839
the dna of lf energy is the linux

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
foundation

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,399
i don't think that lf energy could live

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,959
anywhere else even if it had a different

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,079
name

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,079
because it's all of you it is the kernel

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,399
it is lf networking it is automotive

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,000
grade linux it is lfai

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,120
it is hyper ledger it is node.js it is

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,440
the edge it is cncf it is risk five it

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,000
is

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,839
all of you you have cleared a path and

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,639
you have left breadcrumbs for us to

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
follow

00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,079
those of us from the energy industry and

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,800
while we are a young foundation

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,760
in an old industry we carry a mighty

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,480
history

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,480
and that is the dna of lf energy

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,519
but why put an energy ecosystem in the

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
linux foundation

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,040
my background as most of you know is not

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,079
as a power system

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,839
engineer um but was in enterprise

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,600
information management and governance

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,560
and then i went and i got a phd in

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,680
innovation

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,519
focusing on adoption and diffusion

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,920
most of you have probably seen this

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,120
typical adoption curve gentle

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,160
and predictable most of all innovations

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,480
be they a belief

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,800
a practice or technology follow this

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,800
curve

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,200
this is the diffusion curve we face in

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,760
the next 30 years to avert thousands of

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,440
years

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,920
of climate collapse it is steep

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,480
yet what is hopeful even in the nine

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,959
percent

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,920
annual transformation that we have to do

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,680
for the next

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,959
20 years i say 30 but really it's 20.

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,920
um has been done before

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,399
with the internet and the cloud they

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,399
both

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,480
happened very quickly they went from

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,040
ideas to creation

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,519
and that is the diffusion pattern that

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,279
we have to follow

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,680
on planet earth we have had five

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,839
extinction events before

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,040
all as a result of too much carbon in

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,760
the environment

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,480
this is the first that is man-made we

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,440
need some

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,440
serious superpower to navigate this

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,360
we need mass collaboration like the

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,519
starling murmur

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,519
we need to design the grid of the future

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,720
in relationship to the natural

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,560
systems of the planet

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,480
and for that we need the linux

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,880
foundation and we need you we need

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,320
every single one of you regardless of

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,120
where you come from

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,000
whether you're working in

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,000
telecommunications or you're working on

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,639
automotive or you're working at the edge

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
or

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,519
you're working in blockchain we need you

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
all of these things are going to be

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,360
present and that's what i want to show

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,199
you next

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,560
so these are our marching orders

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,360
it's pretty intense but what's

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,760
i believe hopeful and that gives me hope

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,199
and inspires me is the recognition that

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,600
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,399
of all of the carbon that needs to be

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,399
removed

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:32,240
um from our environment is going to be

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:35,680
captured in the shift to electrification

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,399
and electric mobility and that actually

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,279
is a

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
much more manageable and contained uh

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,440
thing

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,360
that we can probably imagine so

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,360
i want to talk a little bit about where

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,639
we're coming from

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,360
so this is the old system it the whole

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,560
kind of model was generate transmit

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,199
distribute

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,639
distribute it was centralized it was one

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,360
way it was rigid

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,720
and the key principle was inertia

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,240
inertia is

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,760
is the kind of the physics of managing

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,519
supply and demand it was dependent on

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,240
fossil fuel and nuclear

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,440
and the power system sector historically

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,160
looked at investments

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,800
of 50 to 80 years windows and here we

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,040
have

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,720
the need to transform at the speed of

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,040
technology

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
its technology was historically

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,959
proprietary

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,920
it was black box and it has not been an

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,800
easy system to change

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,519
the new grid is composed of variable

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,120
energy

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,880
from pv wind batteries and automobiles

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
it is massively distributed with

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,320
multi-directional communication

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,560
capabilities

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,839
that's a problem we know how to solve

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,959
and this is a problem

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,680
you know how to solve and so while lf

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,560
energy is at its very beginning

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,880
i want you to imagine that for the next

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,519
20 years we are going to be building

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
this thing

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,600
that is going to enable us to transform

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
our economies

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,440
globally lf energy seeks to remove the

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,079
barriers of interoperability

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,920
and systems integration by enabling open

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,519
source plumbing that can create the

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,519
internet of energy

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,320
this is the digitalization

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,320
of energy

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,639
so the vision of lf energy and the

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,639
vision of my

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
um

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,880
and the vision of my members is that the

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,399
greater the future is composed of

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,440
loosely coupled systems that are

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
resilient

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,759
manageable and observable combined with

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,759
robust automation

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,600
and digitalization of energy enables

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,199
engineers and markets to make high

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,880
impact changes frequently

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,720
and predictably with minimal toil

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,519
the next thing that i want to share with

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,519
you is

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,039
you know mike dolan would speak to me

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,679
all the time about

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,520
needing to get the architecture and what

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,120
i came to really understand

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,880
is that when you're talking about the

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,720
grid you're talking about the largest

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,400
machine on the planet

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,000
and so the power system engineers across

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,839
high medium and low voltage

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,199
and from generation all the way to

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,439
behind the meter

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,559
really made a determination that where

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,200
we needed to focus

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,480
was on the functionality and so what i'm

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,679
going to show you is the functional

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,799
architecture

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,840
and in the transition to a cloud native

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,320
grid the features

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,600
and functions of the grid of the future

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,840
are really embodied

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
in this taxonomy

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,760
so what you see here are the top levels

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
of the facets

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,960
and then you have the next level down uh

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,080
which is

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:10,080
um the kind of the buckets

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:14,000
around which all the functionality lives

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,640
and this goes through the whole

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,520
five facets and then you go down another

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,320
layer down

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,360
and this is when actually you can begin

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,200
to visualize

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,200
that this is what the grid of the future

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,840
looks like

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,120
each of these things is probably a micro

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,039
service

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,960
there may be many different components

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,360
there may be some that are open source

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,520
and some that are proprietary there may

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,480
be proprietary that's built on

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,080
on top of these and what you see are

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,679
probably things that are going to be

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,679
built in reference

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,760
implementations that are composed of

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:53,200
software from many different industries

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,160
this is where lf energy is today

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,799
and these are the nine projects that

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,080
represent

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,799
lf energy and the projects that we see

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,799
coming along

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,880
one of the things that we determined

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,000
over the course of the summer

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,320
was that we recognized that we needed to

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
have our projects but we also needed to

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,320
have frameworks

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,360
and that those frameworks were actually

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,360
going to represent

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,480
we're actually going to represent the

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
functional architecture

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,679
data architecture infrastructure and

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,679
security

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,039
so i want to talk a little bit about

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,160
community

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,200
these are our members 34

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,880
and growing and um

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,480
we really welcome you all to join us

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,760
we recently changed our top tier to

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,919
strategic

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,640
because what i've seen in the last six

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,120
months between rte and oleander

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,120
a transmission system operator and a

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,760
distribution system operator

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,960
is i've seen remarkable levels of

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,880
cooperation

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,559
and collaboration even though one is

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,679
dutch and one is french

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,120
and i believe that rte and oleander need

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,919
to be

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,360
beacons for the rest of the world in

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,720
terms of utilities

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,000
recognizing that the kind of r d that we

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
need to do the kind of

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,760
development needs to be leveraged

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,320
development and it needs to be done

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,720
together

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,520
in community and they have demonstrated

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,640
that

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,679
in a remarkable sort of way

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,080
so this year's accomplishments it you

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,760
know

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,080
it's been a horrendous year and it also

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,720
has been a fantastic year

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,200
in that despite or maybe because of the

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,280
challenges we are creating a movement

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,120
we are laying a foundation creating the

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,720
conditions for the entire world to

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,679
collaborate at scale

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,280
to transform energy and power and we're

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,440
doing this in community

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,520
so the things that you see here you know

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
the four new projects another two to

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,559
three in the pipeline by the end of the

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,919
year

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,600
starting in the top of the year we're

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,360
going to begin taking on the various

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,039
different microservices from

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,640
the menash microgrid that

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:18,320
we have 30 to 40 meetings every month

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,840
across sigs tax tscs

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,159
um framework groups um and

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,440
we are have become and are becoming a

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,159
very active

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,440
community but because open source and

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,880
energy is

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,520
really relatively new what we're seeing

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,360
here

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,039
is a lot of capacity building

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,039
and i you know i think i also really

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,640
want to say to the vendors suppliers and

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,280
oems that are listening

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
this is not about cannibalizing capital

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,880
and value

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,440
it's about creating a new paradigm and

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,520
literally

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,520
changing floors and i think that we have

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,720
seen this in telecommunications

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,600
in finance in automotive and many other

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,679
industries

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,679
that have used the platform of open

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,280
source to step up

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,960
and you know the other thing that i

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,120
would say is that what the

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,640
what open source offers us is a

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,039
permissive ip license

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,200
this isn't just about a github this is

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,640
about the ability to

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:20,000
invest to be able to see lf energy as an

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,039
extension of your r d because the future

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,880
really in this area has not been created

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,400
we are just at the very beginning

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,120
so you know there's something that i

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,159
wanted to say i i wrote the presentation

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,159
and then i

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,400
kind of had i thought that there was

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,159
actually something that i didn't share

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,000
and i'll be honest um as a person who

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,760
has been in the deep end of the ocean

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,320
for the last uh period of time

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,880
i don't think i recognized how intense

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,640
the log

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,520
jam is in energy and so the reason why

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
i'm showing this

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,480
is that the thing about a log gem is

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,640
that there is no way

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:08,240
to delicately pick it apart um

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,799
the way you clear a log jam is with

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,760
dynamite

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,000
so i'll leave you with this the hyper

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,320
scaling businesses that have created net

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,799
zero or carbon negative business goals

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,880
you know who you are have become de

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,840
facto energy companies

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,799
they are taking talent and they are

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,679
moving ahead

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,640
at the speed of technology to transform

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,840
their businesses

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,039
into carbon neutral and sometimes even

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,919
carbon negative

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,559
businesses they are creating the future

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,720
they are

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,919
becoming energy companies and in many

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,640
ways because

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,240
they understand cloud native because

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,080
they are the cloud

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,000
in many ways they are better positioned

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
to become the energy companies of the

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,360
future

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,200
because distributed energy requires

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,360
distributed computing

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,320
but you will have to internalize

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,039
the value and benefit for all in other

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,720
words

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,480
utilities one of the things that

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,679
utilities do is that they

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,039
serve at the behest of society they

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,520
are a part of the social contract and

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,919
so you know if you are a big hyper

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,400
scaling business you don't necessarily

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,760
think

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,400
in terms of benefit and value for all

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,080
yet for the future to work and for us to

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,679
truly decarbonize

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,159
part of what we have to do with our

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,400
economy is to do this

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,559
and to recognize energy as part of our

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,080
social contract

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:41,039
however if utilities who are listening

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,240
don't actually blow yourselves up they

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,120
will be blown up

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,840
by google amazon and microsoft's of the

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,320
world

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,360
because the future of energy will be in

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,039
great part

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,720
like with automotive in the cloud and

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,480
we are at the very beginning these

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,919
things are just you know

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,080
we are we are inventing the future

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,840
but you know not long ago someone in the

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,919
energy sector somebody

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,440
truly respects said to me in all

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,679
seriousness

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,520
but what is the burning platform for

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,679
utilities to change

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,720
i shook my head in disbelief if the

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,440
planet burning

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,080
is not a burning platform then i have no

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,360
idea

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,480
what will move the industry so

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,520
you know this is uh this is what i leave

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,840
you with

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:33,279
this is a picture of the the haran

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,080
river in iceland

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,279
and my hope is that this community that

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,000
open source

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,840
lf energy the lennox foundation can get

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,760
the river flowing that

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,400
that you know that maybe we are the

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,960
dynamite we are the new thing we are the

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,000
thing

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,400
that can actually um

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,320
make this happen at a planetary level

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,880
and so in the next 20 years

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,799
i say let's do this together i think

00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,200
we've made tremendous strides in the

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,840
last

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,480
year we are the power of together join

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,840
us

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,840
there is so much to do

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,679
thank you very much thank you shirley

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,919
for sharing that

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,279
it gives us hope that we can tackle

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,840
climate change

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,080
in the future and be a big contributor

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,120
to that effort

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,400
our next speaker sam ramji is chief

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,279
strategy officer at datastax and a

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,520
25-year veteran of silicon valley and

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,400
seattle technology scenes

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,799
sam previously led kubernetes and devops

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,720
product management for google cloud

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,360
founded the cloud foundry foundation

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,679
which is a part of the linux foundation

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,720
that helped build two multi-billion

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,000
dollar markets

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,120
at apogee and bea systems

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,480
he also redefined microsoft's

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,919
open source analytics fantasy from

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,640
extinguish to embrace

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,640
sam is a dear friend of mine and happy

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,880
to have him speaking here today

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
today he's going to talk to us about

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,360
microservices

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,360
2.0 please welcome sam ramji

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,840
microservices 2.0 and data economies

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,559
becoming a data-driven enterprise i'm

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,679
sam ramji

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,240
chief strategy officer at datastax

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,279
the world is evolving towards new

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,880
cloud-native

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,600
data-driven architecture reactive

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,240
streaming bolt-on kubernetes understood

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,159
through a graph

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,840
that builds on what we developed in the

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,440
microservices era

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,480
and creates data economies

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,520
what we learned from microservices 1.0

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,559
is that speed and independence creates

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,360
agility for development teams and data

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,960
sprawl

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,919
for the enterprise a microservice

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,799
is an organizational construct and a

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,720
technical architecture

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,240
a team of people who have all the

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,640
competencies that they need

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,159
from development to operations to

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,640
product management

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,159
small enough that they can have dinner

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,799
eating two pizzas

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,880
the two pizza team and rendering their

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,480
microservice above as an api

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,559
and storing their information in their

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,880
own data store

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,880
it's very good for building things fast

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,360
and iterating rapidly to discover

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,919
what's needed by users and how to

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,039
support

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,760
an slo a service level objective

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,600
it's comprehensive it's complete and it

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,240
has the independence it needs to move

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,159
fast

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,000
this team can use any tools that they

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,640
want any language

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,320
any data infrastructure now

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,039
microservices were the beginning of

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,200
networked data in the enterprise

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,039
services at the core with data

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,679
microservices everywhere

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,679
is the big architectural change

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,360
microservices are about the future of

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,600
data

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,919
the microservices approach is easy to

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,120
scale organizationally and shows greatly

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,159
increased velocity

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,799
as compared to large teams instead of

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,720
using

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,080
hundreds of people in functions

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,039
redeploying them to

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,640
independent fully comprehensive teams

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,000
with all the diversity that they need to

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,240
be successful

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,240
is a much faster way to build

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,760
organizations

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,880
two problems emerge service dependencies

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,080
and data sprawl service dependencies

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,559
look a bit like this

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,000
we have our concept of how our services

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,000
might work with each other

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,080
then we have how we deployed it and then

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,120
we have what grew out operationally

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,000
and our operational view

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,640
of the services and their dependencies

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,720
is almost

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,080
never the same as we thought it would be

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,880
when we designed it

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,159
often we don't even understand the true

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,159
operational practices

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,200
databases themselves are all independent

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,039
and fragmented each one sometimes

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,240
several per microservice

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,399
doing its own thing supported

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,480
idiosyncratically

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,480
by the microservices 1.0 team

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,120
these end up killing developer velocity

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,159
by damaging

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,720
service level objective performance and

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,880
making

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,039
data features complex to build and

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,960
maintain

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,240
we solve service dependencies with a

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,120
surface mesh and

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,600
operational graphs a service mesh lets

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,480
us

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,200
have a common view and common control of

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,320
all the services flowing out of the apis

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,520
between each construct and from the

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,720
microservices

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,399
to their ultimate callers from there

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,399
it's straightforward to build an

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,679
operational dependency graph and know

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,600
what's actually happening

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,799
not what you thought was happening this

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,760
is really really a

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,279
core component for building better snl

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,039
attainment

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
now the data sprawl problem is harder

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,039
because the data stores were

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,760
non-standardized by design

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,320
in that search for independence we told

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,600
the

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,519
development teams they could use

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,559
anything that they want

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,960
so any color you like as it were

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,880
however those competencies are not

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,760
equally distributed across every single

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,880
team

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,279
and as teams churn and change over time

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,919
as you go quarters and years into the

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,159
future

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,880
the composition of the team changes the

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,640
microservice itself might be put into

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,039
a quiescent state where it's only in

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,159
maintenance mode and then you end up

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,720
in real trouble so the solution to data

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,279
sprawl

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,960
is a data mesh that supports many data

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
stores with common infrastructure and

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,519
governance

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,600
moving the data stores out of the

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:52,399
microservices team's purview

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,399
and into an underlying mesh

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,880
collectively a coherent mesh would look

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,320
like this

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:04,080
in a microservices 2.0 world

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,440
this lets you create a data economy

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,840
the common building block is a

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,840
microservices 2.0 architecture

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,279
that gives each development team speed

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,960
and independence

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,880
while giving the enterprise continuous

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,080
data evolution at the velocity

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,039
of the market we reimagine

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,559
the core microservices team beyond just

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,519
the group that was required to build the

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,360
service

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,600
and by broadening our perspective and

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,559
look at machine learning teams at the

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,399
data scientists

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,760
the business analysts at the product

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,919
managers and marketers

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,440
who all need access to that data at

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,159
their own speed

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,600
in order to succeed in the business then

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,960
we get a proper view

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
of what the next generation of

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,720
microservices looks like

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,360
a two pizza team managing their own slo

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,399
without depending on themselves to

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,080
manage the data

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,399
or give access to other teams around the

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,120
enterprise means that they can move

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,000
even faster with fewer constraints while

00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,840
making sure

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,480
that the competencies for data are in

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,399
the right places in the organization

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,320
now in a data economy there's a free and

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,600
open market for microservices that shape

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,559
the data

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,200
they can evolve compete and fade without

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,679
data loss or sprawl

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,480
data scientists developers and product

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,720
owners

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,240
can find and share the microservices

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,159
that work best for them

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,399
while all accessing common data

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,919
underneath this is the foundation of a

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,320
data-driven enterprise

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,960
as those teams change as new needs

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,559
develop

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,640
you could build new microservices

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,720
against the same old data

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,399
getting better access better value and

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,039
making sure that everything is well

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,120
governed

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,320
which is incredibly important in a

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,399
globalized world

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,399
where we worry about the purpose and

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,519
pursuit of privacy

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,360
versus data being used by businesses we

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,840
have to have a common view

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,760
and a common management stance not

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,200
something that is under the purview of

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,039
each microservices team

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,399
but something that is held on behalf of

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,880
all users

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,799
of the data and for all customers of the

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,440
enterprise

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,080
in the fuller view our data mesh based

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,480
world

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,679
looks like this and microservices 2.0

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,000
parlance

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,919
with the data economy bringing everyone

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,240
the data that they need

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,800
to deliver continuous data evolution

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,599
with the speed of the market

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,159
so none of us is as smart as all of us

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,480
none of us

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,280
is as powerful as all of us to go fast

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,159
go alone

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,200
to go far go together who wants to come

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,760
along

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,359
on the microservices 2.0 and data

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,560
economy's journey

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,800
let's go far together thank you very

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,800
much

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,040
thanks sam amazing talk

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,960
our next speaker is neil mcgovern you

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,960
know in august 2019

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,200
the gnome project was notified it was

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,679
being sued in the state of california

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,879
over a broad patent that allegedly

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,359
covered shotwell

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,560
a photo management application the

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,680
plaintiff

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,880
a prolific filer of patent seats

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,359
and a patent assertion entity

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,400
this is the first time that an open

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,599
source project

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,760
has been sued for patent infringement

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,119
neil mcgovern executive director of the

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,760
gnome foundation

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,200
is here to tell you the story of how he

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,520
responded

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,760
how his community responded and the

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,119
strategies that were taken not only to

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,280
defeat the suit

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,160
but to secure a ground breaking

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,359
agreement

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,079
which means that this particular pae

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,119
will never be able to sue any open

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,079
source project

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,079
ever again please welcome neil

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,400
mcgovern

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,599
so hi everybody um my name is neil

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
mcgovern i'm the

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,359
executive director here at the gnome

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,079
foundation

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,480
um it's a delight to be able to be with

00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,880
you

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,800
um even virtually at the lunar

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,280
foundation's open source summit

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,560
and for me to be invited to tell you

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,720
about

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,079
something that happened over the last

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,320
year

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,440
some of you may or may not have heard

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,040
but uh

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,160
gnome got sued by a patent assertion

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,880
entity

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:24,480
over a patent they hold and claim to be

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,680
infringing um from shotwell which is a

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,480
image a photo

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,960
management application that grinnell has

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,079
been

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:39,359
producing and distributing for about

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,079
13 or 14 years now and it's particularly

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,280
interesting because

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,760
this is the first time that a

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,200
piece of open source software has been

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,359
sued in this way

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,320
as far as i know so i just kind of

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,520
wanted to run

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,560
um everyone through what happened

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,160
the process behind it and then

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,400
really kind of highlight the quite

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,320
extraordinary

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:07,680
result that we got out of

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,839
out of this particular case

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,640
so first i just wanted to kind of cast

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,400
your everyone's minds back into

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,079
where we was and how we first found out

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,200
about this

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,480
so this was in august 2019

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,560
um in thessaloniki in greece

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,560
what seems like now a very long time ago

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,240
we had just finished our annual

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,839
conference which is

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,040
gwardek and it was very successful

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,800
we've had a really good time had four

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,760
three days of talks and then another

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,960
couple of days of workshops and

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,400
and get togethers and hack fest to

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,320
try and sort of move glowing forward and

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,560
we'd managed to get half a day at the

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,440
end at the beach to just relax

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,920
and then on coming back from the beach

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,800
there's

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,680
this fantastic ship in the harbour

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,720
that's dressed up like a pirate boat

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,119
and what happens is you get on the boat

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,920
it sails around the harbour for an hour

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,119
or so

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,440
and it's free but the only

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,280
slight catch is that you have to buy at

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,920
least a beer or two from the bar

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,359
so i know not too much of a hardship but

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,720
that's where we are

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:26,000
so i was connected to a wi-fi point

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,520
um just at a cafe on the harbour

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,040
and then suddenly a tweet arrives

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:36,240
which was about gnome getting

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,200
sued over patent infringement in

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,280
shotwell now obviously i was quite

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,760
confused by this because

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,440
this seemed a weird thing we hadn't

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,320
received any sort of

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,440
serving or any notice or any letters

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,160
beforehand

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,599
um saying that there's a problem and

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,160
then i found off of a

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,119
random person on twitter that apparently

00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,760
this is the case

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,040
so i then start to get a little worried

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,280
go online to

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,560
try and find out more and at that point

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,680
the boat leaves

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,359
and my wi-fi access point disappears so

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,640
i'm now stuck on this boat which is

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,800
sailing around the harbour

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,400
looking very pretty and it's a lovely

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,440
hot day there

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,280
but with no internet so i have no idea

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,640
what's going on or what is all this is

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,599
about

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,480
so eventually we managed to get back in

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,160
to land

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,160
managed to get an internet connection

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,040
and then start to piece together

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,040
what was going on

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,680
so a bit of background um this

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,320
particular

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,760
people who were suing us and it did turn

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,280
out it looked like a

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,480
a genuine lawsuit that had been filed

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,680
in northern california was by rothschild

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,119
patent imaging

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:55,200
incorporated now lee rothschild

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,400
is a very well known

00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:02,880
patent patent assertion entity who

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:06,079
has a number of corporate organizations

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,200
and companies that basically each one

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,160
holds

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,520
a single or two patents and so he has a

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,119
number of these organizations and the

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,640
particular organization

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,720
that that was suing us is rothschild

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,800
patent imaging

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,720
and this suit was found at the end of

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,440
august in the district of

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,240
northern california and five other

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,200
companies were

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,920
were sued at the same time and the

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,440
particular

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,560
patent which was filed is the

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,720
086 patent which was filed in 2017

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,760
and the basic idea behind this is

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:48,160
you filter pictures from a camera

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,960
so you plug your camera into a computer

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,480
there's some sort of process for

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,760
filtering those images

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,640
either automatically or manually and

00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,319
then it's sent

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,920
wirelessly to a third device

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,040
so plug your camera in select photos

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,319
from last month

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,200
and send to facebook is the contention

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,440
is that

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,440
this would infringe their patent

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,800
so we have initial response and we need

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,599
to kind of work out what to do

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,520
obviously first i called uh one of my

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,400
our pro bono lawyers which we have in

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,440
new york um

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,480
karen sandler who is um fantastic

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,800
um and got a fair amount of reassurance

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
that

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,079
okay this does appear to be something

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,760
real but it

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,119
the initial look at it seems overly

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,440
broad and

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,800
this is going to be an amount of work

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,680
for us to deal with

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,680
but we should worry too much

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:54,160
however he did also point out that

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,079
to if this was to go the full distance

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,280
to be able to actually

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,760
fight this claim then you're looking at

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,119
a

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,319
bill of around 10 million dollars

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,720
to successfully defend against this

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,760
and uh i'm not sure about everyone here

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,720
but as a

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:17,359
non-profit organization he um only has

00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:19,680
about nine staff at the moment total

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,440
um which is quite large for a uh open

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,920
source project

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,200
we don't have 10 million dollars sat

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,440
around

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,359
so a little bit of a worry there what

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,440
we're going to do

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,400
fortunately i then took the plane back

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,839
home uh

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,640
from greece uh back to the uk and on

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,839
landing

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,960
i had an email uh

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,000
from sherman and sterling who

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,359
are a large

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,400
international law firm and

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,200
matt berkowitz and his team there have

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,839
emailed me

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,480
they have noticed that this has been

00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,640
filed

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,680
in northern california and they reached

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,359
out to us

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,880
and offered to represent us

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,160
pro bono which was a huge relief so

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,280
obviously i called my lawyer and

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,720
mentioned this and

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,640
as you mentioned that they are a

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,359
fantastic firm who

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,000
are able to offer real support so that

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,359
was a

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,160
a real weight off my mind so we start

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,240
talking to

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,359
martin team at sherman about what we're

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,640
going to do

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:29,440
what this is all about

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,079
and so kind of our initial response

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,599
about this

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,040
is my thoughts was this

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:40,160
isn't just about gnome

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,839
this is the first time that open source

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,200
software has been

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:48,160
sued in this way and my worries

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,880
is that this would set a dangerous

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,160
precedent

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,560
if we just gave in to the the demands

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,319
that

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,319
that were that will be required

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:04,240
i also had a concern having a look at

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,440
ross child entities before that

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,240
the case was simply going to be

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,359
dropped before trial what had happened

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,200
before for example

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:18,640
is that um they had sued garmin

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,160
uh garmin defended and said we're going

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,520
to take this all the way to court

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,079
and then lee rothschild uh dropped the

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,800
case

00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,240
about an hour before it was going to be

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,280
before the first hearing in front of the

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,359
judge

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,560
so obviously there's a huge amount of

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,200
expense uh

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,640
and effort that had been put in and the

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,480
rothschild was

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,760
able to just walk away with no

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,119
consequences

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,119
so that that was a concern of mine

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:50,079
and i really wanted to send a

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,720
message that suing a

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,520
open source non-profit and an open

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,280
source

00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:01,119
project was not going to be an easy win

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,520
the way typically these paes work

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,720
is that they in particular in lee

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,880
rothschild's

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,920
case is that they just file multiple

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,920
suits

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,040
against anyone they can possibly get

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,240
away

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,160
and hope for a low to medium settlement

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,880
offer from each of them

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,400
and then they don't necessarily want the

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,440
case to actually go to court

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,000
uh just after a quick payday and trying

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,520
to get

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,800
money out of it so officially

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,119
we were served on august 30th i have

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,160
that

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:37,280
in inverted commas because

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,560
uh they did manage to

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,079
serve to an office that uh an agent of

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,640
ours that we haven't used for about

00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,400
10 years so we never actually receive

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,079
the official serving but

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,880
we thought well we're not going to

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,119
really contest that anyway

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,480
and so we went through a round of pro

00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,680
bono assessments and

00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,160
litigation holds with

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,599
staff and the lawyers so a little bit of

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,160
work there up front just to

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,200
make sure we had all our house in order

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,160
for those that don't know

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,800
litigation holds is where you basically

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,119
tell

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,400
your staff members and anyone involved

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,200
who could possibly be involved in the

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,800
case that

00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,040
they really really shouldn't delete any

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,560
emails or try and get anything

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,599
everything needs to be preserved in case

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,599
of uh discovery

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:29,920
so within about a week

00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,280
of the uh

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,800
of the initial lawsuit uh and then

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,839
us appointing uh appointing um sherman

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,319
and matt and his team

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,200
as our council and we've seen our

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,160
settlement offer

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,760
our first one from rostral patent

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,079
imaging

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:55,200
and this was as expected

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:58,160
they offered us to settle for 75 000

00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,119
so we'd have to pay them 75 000 and in

00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,400
return

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:06,319
we would uh receive a license

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,400
um to use this particular patent

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,160
now obviously for the reasons i

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,319
mentioned before

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:18,000
we we politely declined

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,240
and then put out a statement

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
after a month which was very basic it

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,319
was something along the lines of we are

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,280
aware of this

00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,160
it will be we intend to defend it uh

00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,400
rigorously

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,720
we believe it's baseless more news later

00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,760
so a fairly bland straightforward

00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,559
statement

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,079
which received quite a bit of press also

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,960
reached out to the open innovation

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,800
network

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,559
which are a fantastic group of people

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,920
who have

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,160
as i'm sure some people here will be

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,040
aware have a portfolio of

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,000
defensive patterns now unfortunately in

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,680
this particular case

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,359
because they're a non-practicing uh

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,280
because the rothschild group

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,480
is a non-practicing entity they don't

00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,800
produce anything

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,119
so it's very hard for them to infringe

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,760
on a pattern by not producing anything

00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,160
that they simply exist to hold patterns

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,119
and

00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,720
sue other companies over this however

00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,200
the oin were

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,280
quite instrumental in strengthening our

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,319
hand in a couple of cases

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,359
by identifying prior art and making sure

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,480
that

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:25,520
we would have defense against um

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,520
against lee rothschild

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,640
so then it took a little bit longer and

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,839
we decided that

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,839
it was time to go public

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:43,280
so we went public on

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:46,839
21st of october in 2019

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,520
and we filed

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:53,280
against um against the case

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:56,880
so we had a answer to the complaint

00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:00,839
which was basically say um

00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,000
the patent is valid we're not infringing

00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,880
um

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,680
and and basically to ensure that they

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,079
couldn't simply

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,240
drop the case because under the u.s

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,359
system once you've filed an answer

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,760
then it requires the court

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:19,040
to basically dismiss it it can't just be

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:22,079
unilaterally dropped from from one side

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,240
uh we also issued a counter claim

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,400
for a declaratory judgment that the

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,079
patent itself is invalid

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,559
and then a motion to dismiss the

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,559
complaint um that it was shouldn't have

00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,640
been eligible for patent protection

00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,079
in the first place so this is using

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,200
alice claims and

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,440
various other bits and also for

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,400
um our costs as well essentially our

00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,640
lawyers costs

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,160
and any other costs we had because it

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:49,599
should have been so

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,559
relatedly obvious that the patent

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,599
shouldn't be issued and that this

00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,040
shouldn't be a thing that

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,319
goes forward that it's essentially it's

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,680
a waste of the court's time and

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,400
therefore we should be able to receive

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,520
our costs for this

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,559
we also put out a public statement and

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,559
a call for funds

00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,839
and we within a week or so we had raised

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,960
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:19,520
000 from approximately

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,119
four and a half thousand individuals uh

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,520
throughout there as well which was a

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,559
amazing response and was able to

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,640
certainly

00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:31,839
help us start down this process

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,839
of of ending up where we did

00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:36,079
and about the same time we got a second

00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:40,319
settlement offer which was essentially

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,280
um let's both walk away on an own cost

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,040
basis so

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,400
let's pretend this never happened and

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,720
walk away so we

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,720
again politely declined that

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,319
interestingly we received that offer

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,839
about three times within a one week

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,839
period

00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,119
so i was started to feel a little bit

00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,160
more confident that

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,280
um that this might not end up in a

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,520
lawsuit

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,680
and that they would be quite happy just

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,119
to walk away as soon as they realize

00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,760
that we're not just going to

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,319
pay them their fees unfortunately for

00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,960
them

00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,079
uh as i mentioned we've already filed a

00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,800
number of suits

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,680
and so they couldn't actually drop it um

00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,520
they needed our permission

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,800
and so at that point i wanted to start

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,000
thinking of

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,040
okay well how do i signal

00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,599
what it would take for us to not have

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,319
this

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,800
patent overturned and so we entered up

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,640
this

00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,400
phase of pre-litigation so there's

00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,280
various phases essentially before it

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:47,599
actually ends up in front of a judge

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:51,680
and this lasted about five months or so

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:54,720
and here's where we are again

00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,640
going over our what we're doing

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,800
and and bits of prior art and our

00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,640
defenses

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,559
so we identified 38 bits of prior art

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,240
which include other patents patent

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,119
applications

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,160
some academic papers and and indeed

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,839
projects

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,520
and things that were available before

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,520
the 2017 filing

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,400
and indeed before the the infringement

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,000
claim date that they claimed was i think

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,559
2008 and this included

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,520
stuff that we made before so including

00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,800
shotwell

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,640
and g thumb so the software that they

00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,800
were suing us over

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,800
was its own prior art for the patent

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,000
that they were suing us over

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:42,240
which is quite unusual we also

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,599
identified at that time that we had a

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:48,880
license for the patent in question

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:52,720
through another of our partners so

00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,280
at that point um even if the patent was

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,400
valid

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:59,200
and even if we were infringing we were

00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,359
licensed for it anyway

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,960
uh so at this point i think our our risk

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,240
level of us losing this case is rather

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,599
low

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,680
and then we thought okay so

00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,520
if this does go to court then what will

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,200
happen well

00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,880
and they lose and they get cost awarding

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,520
against them what will happen

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,640
is that uh lots of patent imaging will

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,640
magically fold

00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:24,000
and there won't be any money and it'll

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,000
be a huge waste of everyone's time

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:29,760
so what our legal team

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,200
did is instead of sending our

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,359
depositions to say

00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,079
hey can you tell us more about the

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:39,599
patent all of our questions was about

00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,800
how is rochelle patent imaging

00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,079
funded is it under capitalized who has

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,160
actual control

00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,760
and please show us reasons why the

00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,119
corporate fails should not be pierced

00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,440
and the rothschild be made

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:55,119
personally responsible for the outcome

00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,119
of this case and any potential costs

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,440
we then had a first settlement offer

00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:02,559
which was very much the same

00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,920
and we gave a counter offer to them

00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,760
again this was leading up to the end of

00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,079
february um

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,280
when we had our first judicial hearing

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,119
about it

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,280
so i want to talk about where we ended

00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,280
up

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:21,520
this took another four months or so of

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,280
on and off negotiations sometimes we

00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,520
return to litigation

00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,000
but eventually we did receive a

00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,720
settlement offer

00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,359
that we offered to be rothschild and

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,359
they accepted

00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,799
my key things in this is i wanted to

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,119
show that

00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:42,240
we didn't pay them anything for this

00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,640
offer

00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,599
and i wanted to be able to prove what

00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,240
we'd obtained to help them

00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,280
it needed to apply to all the free

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,839
software

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,520
um it covers the entirely rochelle

00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,680
portfolio not this just this one

00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,599
and it must cover any future patent

00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,640
acquired i didn't want lee rochelle to

00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,240
simply

00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,240
buy up another loads and then come back

00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:08,559
after open source software again

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,119
so there was a lot of back and forth

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,000
some confusion and but eventually we

00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,760
reached the

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,359
final agreement and this final agreement

00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,319
gives a covenant not to sue for

00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:25,200
what is now 150 different patterns under

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:28,720
control of the yacht chart

00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:32,839
for any software that is

00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:36,799
open source to anyone in the world

00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:40,000
forevermore and in perpetuity

00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:41,920
it also the patterns the uh the covenant

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,079
not sue follows the patterns

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,640
and covers anything in the future that

00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,240
they're also able to cover

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,359
in this sense we have essentially

00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,880
removed an entire

00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,799
pattern searching entity from the

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,559
ability to sue any

00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:00,960
open source software um or anyone who

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,160
substantively uses open source software

00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,160
that they claim to have infringed

00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,799
so i think it would have been nice if

00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,200
we'd able to get the

00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:13,200
patent invalidated but i think what

00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,240
we've actually obtained here is a

00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:20,559
far bigger prize that protects

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:24,559
all of open source from a particular

00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:28,319
pae forevermore and i think it sends

00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:31,520
a incredibly strong message

00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:34,160
to any other pae out there that you

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,880
don't sue open source organizations

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,640
otherwise it

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,960
will end badly for you um

00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,000
so at this point i'd just like to um

00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,079
kind of wrap up

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,440
um a quick a huge thank you to

00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,640
um matt and joy and his team at jim and

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,440
sterling

00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,240
um they have been fantastic and worked

00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,920
tirelessly

00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,720
on this case for us over a period of

00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,920
many months and i believe that

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,400
all of us as a open source community owe

00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,920
them a

00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,960
huge debt of gratitude to

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:12,799
their work and to the quite astounding

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,040
outcome we've received

00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,880
so a couple of things just to wrap up

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:20,160
firstly if you produce

00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,799
some open source software and you don't

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,440
believe

00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,160
what we managed to achieve if you email

00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,559
director

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,520
gnome.org i will send you the covenant

00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,680
not soon

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,799
and you can have a look yourself that

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,040
was the key thing to show

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,720
exactly what was covered and how broad

00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,920
it is

00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,160
secondly a plug this

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,960
although we managed to raise 150k for

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,319
this

00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,359
the amount of work and time it took is a

00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:50,400
huge undertaking by the foundation

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:53,280
if you would like to support us

00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,119
please do if you go to gnome.org there's

00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,920
a donate button at the top

00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,480
um and we'd really appreciate anyone

00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,400
who's

00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,400
able to offer their donations or their

00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,359
time if you work for a

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,200
organization that that this has helped

00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:08,880
or an organization that wants to support

00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,520
us please email me

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,799
at neil at gnome.org or director

00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,000
gnome.org

00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:18,000
and we can have a discussion about

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,200
ways you can sponsor us and and the way

00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,119
that

00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,440
free software on the desktop has kind of

00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,839
helped to

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,440
has helped you and helps people in what

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,880
they do

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,720
so i'd just like to say thank you to

00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,839
everyone for coming along to this talk

00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,799
it's a honor to be here i

00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:38,240
think there's a mechanism for asking

00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,920
questions as well which i'll be able to

00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,839
respond to later

00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,160
so thank you very much and i hope you

00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:47,119
have a fantastic rest of the conference

00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,480
thank you neil for joining us today to

excited to share more

00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:41,200
about the upcoming cncf end-user

00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,119
technology radar

00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,319
i'll be asking cheryl questions on the

00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,160
goal of the radar

00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:49,280
what makes it different and how you can

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,200
get involved so we'll jump in right away

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,200
cheryl as you know i'm excited to get

00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,400
the word out about the tech radar here

00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,440
at cncf

00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,839
one of our goals at cncf is end user

00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,000
driven

00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,920
open source which you also highlighted

01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,359
at the last kubecon cloud native con

01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,440
europe virtual

01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,520
can you highlight how this tech radar

01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,880
fits in to the strategy of end user

01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,000
driven open source

01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,520
what is the goal it's a brilliant

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,680
question caitlin

01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:18,240
one of the challenges with open source

01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,880
is that even though adoption is really

01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,119
easy

01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,960
especially in the container world where

01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,920
you can install an image with a single

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,400
command

01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,599
it makes it really hard to know who is

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,079
exactly using

01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,160
what and that makes it hard for project

01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,520
maintainers to know what features they

01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,520
should prioritize

01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:39,040
and it makes it hard for other end users

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:42,000
to know what tools they should be using

01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:43,440
the end user technology radar is a

01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,559
quarterly report

01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,040
from the cncf end user community who are

01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:52,160
a group of 140 companies

01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:54,240
who are all adopting cloud native

01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,200
and the goal is to share what they

01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,839
really use

01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,119
and really recommend when it comes to

01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,280
cloud native

01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,160
so that project maintainers and other

01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,040
end users

01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,799
can prioritize based on honest real

01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,040
world experience

01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:11,839
and that's what we mean by end user

01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,839
driven open source

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,839
that's excellent changing yours a little

01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,480
what do you think

01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:20,240
makes the cncf technology radar

01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,319
different from something like a gartner

01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,640
magic quadrant

01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:27,040
i'm glad that you asked that caitlyn the

01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:30,000
cncf technology radar was partially

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,480
inspired by the gartner magic quadrant

01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,880
both

01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,640
help companies choose between technology

01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,119
solutions

01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,480
the biggest difference is that the

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,920
gartner magic quadrant

01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:44,240
uses proprietary data analysis methods

01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,599
while we've designed the cncf technology

01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,400
radar to be open

01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,119
and to be transparent and driven by the

01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,760
cncf

01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:53,119
end user community you can read about

01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,440
how it's created

01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,680
you can see the data behind it and you

01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,640
know who authored the report

01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,760
for example our next report comes from

01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,119
ticketmaster

01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:07,680
dailymotion and indeed

01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,520
very cool i just love how this showcases

01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,280
feedback from so many different types of

01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,520
organizations

01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,559
i understand the radars are done

01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,640
quarterly and

01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,440
we've had previous ones done on

01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:23,359
continuous delivery and observability

01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,440
so what's next our next tech radar is

01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:27,039
going to come out during kubecon north

01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,039
america virtual

01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:31,920
and the topic is something very close to

01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:35,119
my heart which is database storage

01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,839
and that's everything from postgres to

01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:39,920
managed services like rds to

01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:44,200
specifically cloud native projects

01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:45,599
like vtess we're going to publish it to

01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:49,039
radar.cncf.io

01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:51,359
so keep an eye out in november

01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,240
oh great i know everyone will be excited

01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,480
to see it

01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,760
i'm sure we also now have many people

01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,640
wondering the same thing i

01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:02,640
am how do i get my organization involved

01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:05,680
to participate in the next tech radar

01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,520
the cncf end user community is the place

01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,400
to be for anyone who wants to get

01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,520
involved

01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:14,079
with the cncf detect radar if you're

01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:17,440
adopting kubernetes and cloud native

01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:19,760
you should check out cncf.i join

01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,520
or get in touch with caitlyn or with

01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,240
myself

01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,119
thank you cheryl i cannot wait to see

01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,440
what trends

01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,960
come out of the next tech radar i think

01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,599
that's all the time we actually have for

01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,520
today

01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,920
so swing by our booth here at open

01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:37,039
source summit if you have more questions

01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,720
on the tech radar or cncf in general and

01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,640
don't forget to sign up for kubecon

01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,880
cloudnativecon north america

01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,960
coming up on the 17th to 20th of

01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,960
november

01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:51,039
thank you caitlin can't wait to see you

01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,039
there and let's keep cloud native

01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:59,839
everywhere

01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:07,520
thank you caitlin and cheryl

01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,240
next it's my pleasure to welcome camilla

01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,720

01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,000
global offerings leader of multi-vendor

01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,119
software support

01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and todd moore vp of open technology

01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,359
ibm developer and developer advocacy at

01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,599
ibm

01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,359
today they are going to share key

01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,440
elements organizations

01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,720
should consider when looking to leverage

01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,920
open technologies

01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:32,640
at scale please welcome camilla sharp

01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,640
and todd moore

01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,119
thank you jim um and thank you for that

01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,920
that nice introduction i'm i'm here with

01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,079
camilla sharp

01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,839
uh we think we have some topics that are

01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,440
really relevant for you here

01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,039
there's two transitions that are

01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,920
happening within the european

01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,640
uh community and one is a transition to

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,720
digital

01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,400
and the other is a transition to green

01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,760
and open source is a way to further

01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,680
accelerate that

01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,680
and as we go through our talk today we'd

01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,920
like to introduce you to some of the

01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,720
things that we've seen is important to

01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,880
enterprises

01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,480
talk to you about the open enterprise

01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,480
and how you two

01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,160
can think about it participate and and

01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,799
be part of the open source community and

01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,640
world

01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:16,240
so uh camille i'll turn it over to you

01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,880
and you can get started for us how's

01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,799
that

01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,400
great thanks todd so as todd mentioned

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,720
though we wanted to take a look at

01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,240
sort of some of the top trends that

01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,200
we're seeing today

01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,880
and really hone in on one specific area

01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,799
that we're seeing really is an emerging

01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,160
trend among our clients and that's

01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,799
really the topic of open source

01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,960
governance

01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:36,000
when i talk about open source governance

01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,880
what i'm referring to

01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,480
is really the people the processes that

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,640
are used to create that management

01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,799
system around technology usage

01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,280
so you can really think of it as open

01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:49,440
source management if you will

01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,280
now when i talk about open source

01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,880
governance i like to use this chart here

01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,520
which is around the application

01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,799
lifecycle management and the reason i do

01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,240
this is because it's important to

01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,240
understand that when you're building an

01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,000
application or a product and you know

01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,000
it's really from conception right

01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,079
through to end of life

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,640
governance plays a major role in almost

01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,400
every aspect of that cycle

01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,400
so when i'm talking with clients on a

01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,000
regular basis some of the challenges

01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,359
that they bring forward in governance

01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,880
are what you're seeing on the chart here

01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:18,240
so i'll just take a minute to cover a

01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,640
few of these um

01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,720
so really when you're first starting to

01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,240
develop an application you know

01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,240
so a lot of the times we have clients

01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,920
that are asking well what are the right

01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,240
technologies how do i make the right

01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,839
technology choices and how do i ensure

01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,680
that those technologies are going to be

01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,920
around for the long term if i'm going to

01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,520
invest in using those technologies

01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,280
when they actually start to design and

01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,720
build those applications

01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,559
it gets into more questions on the

01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,520
development side around are these

01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,839
actually the products

01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,720
the right products for what i'm doing

01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:49,359
and in addition

01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,839
there's a lot of choice so how do i pick

01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,760
between

01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,280
a community version versus a commercial

01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,480
version because there's so many

01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,240
different flavors

01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,160
so for example if you're using a

01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,599
postgres database there's a lot of

01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,359
choices that you have

01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,440
so from a governance to aspect it's

01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:05,200
important to understand

01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,720
what the differences are feature

01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,640
functionality and what's going to work

01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,160
best for you as a customer to solve your

01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,680
business challenges

01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,520
you know if we keep going around there

01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,119
all the way around to maintain so you've

01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,079
built your application you've pushed it

01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,599
into production

01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,359
well you want to make sure that your

01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,119
application is supported right that

01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,319
there's enterprise support for all the

01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,240
components that make

01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,240
up that and what we find with our

01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,960
clients is that they're not using one or

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,720
two or even

01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,160
five or ten different software products

01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,079
when they're building these things

01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:34,559
they're using really complex software

01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,799
stacks so things like interoperability

01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,720
play a major role because what happens

01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,839
if you push something into production

01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,680
and something changes in your

01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,799
environment is there going to be an

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,240
interoperability

01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:46,480
issue or is there something that maybe

01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,559
you need to update and then finally just

01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,000
the ongoing piece of it so

01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,240
if you want to ensure that you're

01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,720
promoting usage of open source

01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,400
across your organization you know first

01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,920
off you need to understand

01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,000
what open source is actually being

01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,920
utilized today and then

01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,920
when you actually utilize those open

01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,920
technologies you know are there license

01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,680
implications and then finally

01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,760
if you are an organization that wants to

01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,520
ensure that you're truly embracing open

01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,200
source and that you're able to use it at

01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,640
scale

01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,400
you know how do you make sure that you

01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,600
create efficiencies across your

01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,279
organization

01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,199
so that you're using similar

01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,560
technologies especially if you're in an

01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,759
organization that's very

01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,839
siloed and you have different

01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,279
development teams you want to make sure

01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,319
that you're taking advantage of

01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,400
efficiencies

01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:32,000
and that you're actually able to procure

01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,839
and manage those products

01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,920
kind of similar to how you would in a

01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:39,040
proprietary software fashion

01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,960
now why is governance such a hot topic

01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,560
um you know i have my own personal

01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,159
opinions on that and it was interesting

01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,920
because earlier today todd and i

01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,600
were chatting a little bit around europe

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,799
specifically and what we're seeing and

01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,319
we actually had

01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:52,239
a difference of opinion because we were

01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,239
seeing different things so

01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:55,359
when i talk to clients i'm actually

01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:57,600
finding that

01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,880
um a lot of them in europe they've

01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,640
definitely embraced

01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,640
open source that they're using it at

01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,480
scale but they're at the point right now

01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,839
where in some instances it's gotten a

01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,960
little bit out of control and they're

01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:09,359
trying to figure out

01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,600
how do i kind of identify what i'm using

01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,440
and reigning it back in a little bit

01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,040
so todd maybe you could share a little

01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,839
bit of your perspective like we talked

01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,120
about earlier

01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:21,679
yeah and you know what i saw was i see

01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,199
growing contribution but but the the

01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,520
folks in europe that we're dealing with

01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,600
the

01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,279
the types of discussions we're having

01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,159
are more along the lines of how now do i

01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,799
get into

01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:32,640
the contributing side so they need that

01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:34,480
guidance and governance structure within

01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,480
their their own enterprise in order to

01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,120
be able to figure out then how to safely

01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,520
go about

01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,719
being part of that contribution process

01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,719
so on the one hand

01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,920
their tremendous interest in getting

01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,719
going and

01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,279
forming up within their enterprise uh

01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,799
some

01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,480
governance structure as you've said

01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,080
camilla but yet they haven't

01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,759
been out there really in the

01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,040
contribution process to the extent that

01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,080
some of the other parts of the world

01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,280
have

01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,960
yeah absolutely and i think you

01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,560
mentioned it earlier too in the intro

01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,480
around transformation digital

01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,800
transformation right so i think one of

01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,199
the main drivers of this especially in

01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,760
in

01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,239
today's environment is that our clients

01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,920
are really

01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:11,520
you know embracing open source and

01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,760
trying to figure out ways of how they

01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,440
can accelerate digital transformation

01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,600
now that i've kind of set the stage in

01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,199
terms of you know how i view open source

01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,320
governance and some of the challenges

01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:22,159
that that we're hearing on the

01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,760
technology support services side i'll

01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,520
turn it back over to utah

01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,880
and you can tell the audience a little

01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,640
bit more about you know

01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,159
best practices for creating and

01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,480
fostering an open enterprise

01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,360
because ibm like we've been involved in

01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,080
open source for

01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,520
decades now and i think you can help

01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,960
share some of the lessons learned that

01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,840
we've learned along the way

01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,040
um open technology is accelerating at an

01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,360
exponential rate

01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,560
the enterprises that are those that i

01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,040
deal with the clients

01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,719
um have have just adopted it as just

01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,000
part and parcel of their strategy their

01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:55,040
developers are

01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
consuming open source at a rapid pace

01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,719
they're looking for safe ways to to uh

01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,640
go about

01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,480
that consumption process as well as the

01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,000
contribution process because

01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,080
there's you know various terms of

01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,560
licensing and that applies to both

01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,239
copyright and intellectual property and

01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,719
you know if you look back in the history

01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:16,000
of this it really sort of started with

01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:18,640
with linux and apache

01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,360
uh the html server going into apache and

01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,520
of course

01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,640
i was on those very early calls with my

01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,719
team looking at

01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,159
uh with linus torvald that you know what

01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:29,280
could we do with

01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:30,719
with linux and and we realized that it

01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,920
could really provide

01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:35,280
an engine for for growth um in in what

01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,400
we were doing at that time on

01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:40,000
on on servers so it became you know

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,760
something where ibm put a billion

01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,600
dollar investment into it and and we

01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,480
pledged to not assert our patents

01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,040
against uh against the little fox guy

01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,840
there

01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,920
and and as a result of that um we put

01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,360
faith in behind it for enterprises to

01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,640
start to adopt it and it started the

01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,239
ball rolling

01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,640
and then of course eclipse came along

01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:59,040
where we made a large code contribution

01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,920
to

01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:03,760
kick that off and you know that just

01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,280
just took off wildly to support the

01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,040
world of java and

01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,320
and on and on and on but this

01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,480
exponential rise has

01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,360
has continued here and in the last you

01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,239
know 10

01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:16,000
years we've seen project after project

01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:18,320
come about really substantial things

01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,120
containers and docker node.js

01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:22,560
you know 95 of the world's web services

01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,960
or have some kind of

01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,480
tied back into javascript now and it

01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,640
became such that

01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,080
we had to found foundations within the

01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,760
foundation the cloud native computing

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:36,080
foundation as an example

01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,840
uh has a group of 33 i think now

01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,520
projects that are either in incubation

01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,520
or graduated um

01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,199
and and that's just so that we can keep

01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,760
track of what's happening within that

01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:48,480
small space but there's 1200

01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,640
1200 projects in the cloud native

01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,560
landscape that are associated with that

01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,159
little things like kubernetes that may

01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,040
be a thing that's going to run the world

01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,840
here right

01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,560
um and you know open js the same kind of

01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,159
thing amp

01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,679
electron dojs jquery grunt

01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:05,440
you name it there's a great set of

01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,719
projects 33 projects within that

01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,400
foundation as well too

01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,760
um so that's a little bit of the history

01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:13,199
and that's what really has

01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,520
has pushed us uh all as an industry and

01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,800
as uh those who are going through this

01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,400
digital transformation

01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,040
to just embrace it and move with it

01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,960
because it's the very fastest way to get

01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,679
to the leading technologies to build

01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:29,360
what it is you want to go and build

01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:31,840
so um however um you know i

01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,640
i believe that and i strongly believe

01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,320
this that if you're

01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,920
consuming open source you really need to

01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,320
be contributing to open source there's

01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,560
this

01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,560
harmonious cycle that happens whereas

01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,400
you make those contributions and you get

01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,600
deeper into the community you gain their

01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,480
trust you help

01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,640
shape the direction where you go and and

01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,640
as a result of that you can move faster

01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,520
accelerate your business differentiate

01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,960
yourself

01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,560
and and really go beyond just taking in

01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,040
and consuming open source

01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,880
but being part of that world we love to

01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,520
see good neighbors who come in and join

01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,360
us and

01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,120
we and ibm like to help people come and

01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,239
do that oftentimes we'll we'll get

01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,080
engaged and

01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,600
and if you've got a problem we're we're

01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,920
happy to help you get

01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,360
over that and into this contribution

01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,960
cycle but when you do

01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,440
remember all organizations aren't

01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,480
exactly the same you need to realize

01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,920
that open's great but

01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:24,560
it can be risky um you know some of the

01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,080
places you may look into might actually

01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,960
have some proprietary

01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,640
code that's put there or a license that

01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,719
uh is unfriendly

01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,320
um so you have to be careful or or it's

01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,520
a community you know maybe that just

01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,360
doesn't have many people

01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,960
contributing to it the last contribution

01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,600
was maybe a while ago

01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,880
also you know if you look at what's

01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,520
essential to

01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,000
becoming an open enterprise you need to

01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,360
have

01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,840
a program that that you put in place and

01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,719
for us here in ibm it's always started

01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,400
with training

01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,080
we make sure everybody has yearly

01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,480
training and certification so that they

01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:00,880
know what the rules of the road are

01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,719
they're all now able to go out and

01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,520
freely contribute into open source

01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,280
projects

01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,880
we make sure that people are recognized

01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,400
for their contributions

01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,000
so those people who are out there who

01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,520
are significant contributors

01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,760
uh into projects or committers or

01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,480
maintainers uh have the ability to be

01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,800
recognized

01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,920
uh and and monetarily compensated for

01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,000
that we have

01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,600
tools to help them go scan the code and

01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,560
then of course having an organization

01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,760
that supports your

01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,760
your team across the board so that um as

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,120
as they progress if you clear those

01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,920
packages for use

01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,520
um that you you have people who

01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,600
understand it or recording it

01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,080
and helping you through the process of

01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,480
managing that go out consume

01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:42,719
do it you know carefully eyes open

01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:45,280
contribute as i said into

01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,800
organizations that you you feel very uh

01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,520
confident and friendly in

01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:52,239
lastly i just want to say you know

01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,640
create an open source project office

01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:56,880
make sure that it encompasses the

01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,080
business aspects the legal aspects

01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,159
that it brings the technical

01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,920
stakeholders together so that they

01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:03,679
understand the processes and that you

01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,679
can work with them to smooth out any

01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,760
points as you go through this

01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,199
centralize it have a core team that

01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,280
manages it

01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:12,320
and and then make sure you have adequate

01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,880
folks there who

01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,640
could consult with the developer teams

01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,679
and and help them through the process of

01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,960
becoming

01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:24,640
both really smart about what

01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:26,800
they do from a standpoint of consumption

01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,239
but also how to go out and contribute in

01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,040
open source it's a little different than

01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:32,880
doing a product inside

01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,360
people can sometimes be a little afraid

01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,840
of that we generally offer

01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,440
projects uh help with you know how to

01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,600
get your first pull request

01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,040
landed and then some mentoring to help

01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,520
move them along as they go

01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:47,360
so develop those skills within your team

01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,239
and and help to share those across your

01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,400
enterprise

01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:51,280
and of course um as you go through this

01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,280
we'll have

01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,640
uh secure engineering practices that you

01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,239
need to go in it

01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,840
through and make sure you just track

01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,280
those vulnerabilities so

01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,280
uh you know you'll want to be able to

01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,520
remediate as i said earlier so

01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,480
so that's that's what we believe you

01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,800
should at least

01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:08,480
start with and um if you need a little

01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,000
assistance i think camilla can

01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,640
tell you a little bit more about what

01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,719
what we have going on in this regard

01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,000
great thanks todd um look i've been

01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,760
fortunate that i've worked with several

01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,679
members of your team and we've delivered

01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,159
some workshops to clients to help them

01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,800
understand more you know in-depth ibm

01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:25,040
practices

01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,239
lessons learned um and how to set up a

01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,920
project office but

01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,600
what we find is there's a lot of those

01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,920
questions that i mentioned earlier

01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,960
and challenges that they're facing so in

01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,040
addition to providing

01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,000
enterprise level support on both

01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,320
commercial and

01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,840
community open source products we're now

01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,400
trying to address some of those

01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,080
other issues for clients that i

01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,960
mentioned earlier so things like

01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,960
interoperability questions product

01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,320
optimization making choices around

01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,320
products things like that

01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,239
those are all types of services that

01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,520
technology support services can help our

01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:57,120
clients with now

01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,159
and we now have the ability to support

01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:02,400
over 240 different community open source

01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,920
packages so it's a pretty comprehensive

01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,400
list

01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,440
so with that todd i'll turn it back over

01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,800
to you because i think there's one other

01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,040
thing that you'd like to cover today

01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,080
before we close every quarter we hand

01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,400
out awards

01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:19,199
uh to really deserving organizations

01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,239
that we you know we feel very strongly

01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,320
about supporting

01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:24,000
and and we do it by having the open

01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,719
source development community

01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,760
across the company uh both suggest

01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,640
people who can be

01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,360
um benefit from from these uh grants

01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,480
that we give

01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:38,159
and in this quarter um we awarded

01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:40,480
a black girls code uh with 25 000 in

01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:44,400
cash and 25 000 in in

01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:47,120
cloud credits and this is super for us

01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,760
it's a an organization that you know

01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,800
serves

01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:53,840
the the community uh they've got a

01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,520
a great mission right they want to

01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:57,520
increase the women of color

01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,360
who are out in the digital space

01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,239
basically empower people between the

01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,719
ages of

01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,840
of seven and 14 to become innovators in

01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:06,640
stem field

01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,280
and uh it's just wonderful their goal is

01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,800
uh

01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:12,480
you know a million girls by 2040. so

01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,560
there's a little more that i think jim

01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:16,320
zeman will talk to you about ibm's

01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,320
sponsored a step challenge and i'll let

01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:23,840
him fill you in on the rest so over to

01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:23,840
you jim

01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,520
thank you todd and camilla as todd

01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,560
mentioned one of the experiences you can

01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,920
participate in

01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,280
this week is our fit and fundraiser

01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:39,679
step challenge with the move spring app

01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,920
we're asking all attendees to join the

01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,040
step challenge over the event days this

01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,679
week

01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:47,520
help us hit our goal of a million steps

01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,280
before the end of the event

01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,440
and we'll be donating five thousand

01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,320
dollars to black girls who code on your

01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,640
behalf

01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,840
thanks to ibm who's sponsoring this

01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,000
challenge

01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,360
in addition take some time between

01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,679
sessions to play

01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,640
some games at the red hat arcade and

01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,040
have some fun

01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,719
in our virtual photo booth sponsored by

01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:10,159
cncf

01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:12,719
we've also have a great zen zone for you

01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,600
for additional wellness and tomorrow we

01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:15,760
kick off

01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,000
a trivia challenge that i hope all of

01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,800
you will join

01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,480
and now our final keynote session of the

01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,600
day

01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:28,080
the global it industry is responsible

01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:32,000
for four percent of global emissions

01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:33,840
and is on track to double that by 2025.

01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,360
in the data center world we are

01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,600
collectively doing

01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:39,600
a decent job driving advances in

01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,520
operational energy efficiency

01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,920
but this is only part of the puzzle

01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:46,639
operationalizing

01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,440
circular data centers means enabling a

01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:50,400
global

01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:51,120
circular i.t hardware industry and to do

01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,040
so

01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,880
to catalyze both financial and

01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:57,600
environmental opportunities

01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,560
and democratize access to growth our

01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,679
next speaker

01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,520
ali fenn president at it renew will

01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,520
discuss how

01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,400
operationalizing a global circular i.t

01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,440
industry

01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:15,840
is both an opportunity and an imperative

01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:15,840
please welcome ollie fenn

01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,280
all right thanks jim great to be here

01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,639
i'm really excited to be here

01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,560
talking to all of you at the at the

01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,800
summit this year again i'm gonna

01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,800
uh take us down perhaps a less familiar

01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,480
path today and we're going to talk about

01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,760
about hardware open hardware in

01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,280
particular but hardware and

01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,199
sustainability

01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,560
um and the reason it's it's important

01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:38,080
and hopefully interesting to all of you

01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:39,120
most of whom are probably in the

01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,840
software side of the

01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,120
side of things is that every bit of

01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,679
software is running on hardware

01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,920
somewhere

01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,920
and we have a huge opportunity and

01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,360
actually a shared imperative

01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,360
to make sure that that hardware that's

01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:54,880
running is as cost effective

01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,880
and as sustainable as as possible um

01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,800
that is uh that's what's behind our

01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,719
thesis about orchestrating a global

01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,800
circular i.t hardware industry

01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,840
and that's in fact the business that i t

01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,440
renew is in

01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,560
so i am president at i.t renew we are

01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,239
as i said in the business of

01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,120
orchestrating a global circular i.t

01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:14,080
hardware industry

01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,639
what that means in practice is that we

01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,000
uh

01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:18,159
we think about the world in kind of

01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,480
upstream and downstream constituents

01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:22,080
on the upstream side we are in the

01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,040
business of working very closely with

01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,040
hyperscale

01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,560
cloud data center operators and cloud

01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,280
service providers

01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,080
we work with them on kind of strategic

01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,800
analysis

01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,280
and operation of maximizing lifetime

01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,320
value

01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,520
inclusive of multiple pathways for that

01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,000
hardware once it comes out of their

01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,000
equip

01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,840
equipment out of their environments and

01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,320
we'll talk about that in more detail

01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,080
as we go forward here and then on the

01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:50,080
downstream side of our business

01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:53,040
we uh i.t renew orchestrates a number of

01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:54,480
global markets so we serve uh solutions

01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,800
provide solutions into

01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,400
the broader tier two three four cloud

01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,560
service provider market the enterprise

01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,360
market the telco market and so forth

01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,960
so that we are really collectively

01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,199
bringing about this circular economic

01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,040
model and what that means in theory is

01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:11,199
you know keep assets in their highest

01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,480
utility value as long as possible right

01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,440
so in the data center space we think

01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,880
about racks

01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,320
when those racks are decommissioned and

01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,000
end of first life and have a lot of

01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,679
valuable remaining life on them

01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,600
we sell them as racks into other

01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:23,440
solutions then edge form factors and

01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,040
then components so multiple pathways

01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,280
where we're optimizing the mix

01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,080
and in doing so both the financial value

01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,440
of assets

01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:33,440
and the sustainability of those assets

01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,880
so i'm going to step back a little bit

01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,480
here and kind of talk through the

01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,480
the problem statement or why this is so

01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:41,040
important for all of us to think about

01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,600
and the reality is simple we we as an

01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,239
industry

01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:46,159
are collectively working on uh you know

01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:47,440
technologies and solutions and business

01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,440
models and businesses

01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,880
that have immense positive potential

01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,600
right the technology

01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,719
industry touches everything and solves

01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,239
some of the most important and

01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,360
interesting challenges creates some of

01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,880
the most important and interesting

01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,800
opportunities

01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,560
and yet maybe our heads are in the

01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,040
clouds a little bit right there's a

01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,400
a bit of a sort of dirty underbelly

01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,639
belly or a negative

01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,159
side of an effect of all of this massive

01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,520
scale infrastructure

01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:14,159
and a few of the points you see here

01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:17,280
i'll just touch on on this slide right

01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,679
from a materials perspective we are on

01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,600
track

01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:21,040
to run out of the minerals that go into

01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,199
electronics

01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:24,880
um the there are lots of there are

01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,719
people who are starting already

01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,400
to work on strategies for starting to

01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:29,280
mine these same minerals out of the deep

01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,440
sea bed

01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,480
uh which would have obviously just a

01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,840
tragic effect on

01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:37,199
on on that ecosystem and is arguably

01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,480
the wrong approach right we need to

01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,360
think about how to do things more

01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,440
sustainable

01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,800
sustainably right at the same time

01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,840
things like ai

01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,199
immensely powerful tool in again some so

01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,560
much of the important work that's

01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:50,480
happening digitally

01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,000
and yet the forecast is that within the

01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:54,480
next four years

01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,400
that we're gonna ai alone is gonna be

01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,600
you know consuming as much as 10 percent

01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,080
of the global electricity that's

01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,920
consumed

01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,520
annually right this is an immense

01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,120
environmental impact

01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,400
of these technologies as they get

01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,120
stronger and stronger and more and more

01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,560
powerful

01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:10,000
right at the same time you know most of

01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,560
the rest of the world is on track to

01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,880
reduce

01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:14,400
global greenhouse gas emissions but the

01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,960
digital industry in gen

01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,880
in in its entirety is actually on path

01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,080
to go from four to eight percent so in

01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,760
other words as a sector

01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,280
we're going the wrong direction right

01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,960
instead of minimizing our impact

01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,480
our impact is going up and that's just

01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,560
the nature of the immense

01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,679
scale of the infrastructure that we're

01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,199
running

01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:35,120
now looking at data center specifically

01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:37,280
data center growth unsurprisingly

01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,719
especially in an era of a pandemic which

01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:41,920
is accelerating

01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:43,600
so much digital transformation um is

01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,840
is explosive right there gartner

01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,840
estimated uh late in 2019 that there are

01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,760
about 65 million servers

01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:52,320
to currently deployed in data centers

01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:55,360
that have more than 50 racks in them

01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:57,360
and between 2019 and 2023

01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,199
we would add about 14 million servers a

01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:01,840
year into those same environments

01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:04,159
which should have us ending at that

01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,719
period that time period with 121 million

01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,880
servers

01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:08,880
in in production in deployment in those

01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,560
environments but unfortunately that's

01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,159
not the reality the forecast is actually

01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,920
that we exit that same period

01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:15,360
with only 75 million servers in

01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,080
production in those environments which

01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,639
means

01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,600
that nearly 50 million servers are going

01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,920
to be eol

01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,920
or end of life between the period of

01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,239
2019 to 2023

01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,199
and that creates an immense waste stream

01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,960
and uh

01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:30,560
and the onus is on all of us to think

01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,400
about how do we

01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,760
how do we think differently about this

01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,040
one of the stats i didn't mention on the

01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,760
previous slide is that

01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,800
you know we we create annually more than

01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,880
50 million

01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,560
tons of e-waste right and so of course

01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,440
that that 50 million tons

01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:47,840
number is huge it's the equivalent of of

01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,920
18-wheel trucks stacked back-to-back

01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,400
lined up from new york to bangkok and

01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,920
back filled with e-waste

01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,840
that includes consumer electronics and

01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,199
other e-waste but this 50 million

01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,679
servers that's coming out of data

01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,600
centers

01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,719
is a huge portion of it and we need to

01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,360
think differently about it

01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,800
so that's one of the challenges now

01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,960
we're doing a really good job

01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,199
in the data center sector right on on

01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:11,520
some parts of the sustainability thing

01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:12,639
right so think about renewables there's

01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,960
all over the press

01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:16,639
thankfully major players in the space

01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,280
major data center operators have very

01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,199
much focused over the past decade on

01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,960
on two things one is operational

01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:24,639
efficiency in the form of pue

01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,480
and making sure that we're running our

01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:29,040
data centers as efficiently as possible

01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:31,120
we've made very significant gains there

01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,880
and we've also made significant gains

01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,480
in the shift to renewables right

01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,400
originally it was mostly about renewable

01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:38,080
credits and that was a nice step

01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,840
increasingly it's actually about

01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,719
supplying these data centers with green

01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,360
energy which is

01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,440
an even better step and this is

01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:47,360
essential and urgent and important work

01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,480
and we need to continue doing this right

01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,480
job number one

01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,520
keep marching on the path to renewables

01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,600
uh

01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,120
and then and and we'll get there right

01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,600
let's assume success there

01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:59,600
if we assume success there then we need

01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,280
to ask the next question which is if

01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,520
everything we just talked about

01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,520
is about the operational phase energy

01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,679
are we looking at the whole picture

01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,040
right and this uh it renews done some

01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:09,840
interesting research over the past year

01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,600
or so

01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,239
to really truly fully look at the whole

01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,960
life cycle everything that goes into it

01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:18,080
equipment

01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:21,040
from its its conception through its use

01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:22,320
into its disposition and uh and there's

01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,320
some very interesting data that comes

01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:26,639
out of that analysis which helps us

01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:28,159
to understand where next to look so on

01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:29,679
this slide i've got just a a

01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:31,760
more detailed picture of what that life

01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,360
cycle analysis looks like

01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,040
um and effectively we've looked at

01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,639
everything that goes into the mining of

01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,560
materials and minerals

01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:40,080
through to component manufacturing

01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:42,639
across all of the components that go

01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:44,639
into a standard x86 rack

01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:46,639
in this case an open compute rack open

01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,480
hardware odm built

01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,840
and then of course system assembly into

01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,440
servers and racks

01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,880
and then the use phase stuff which

01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,400
people well understand

01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,000
and then of course the end of life

01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,440
processes of sorting shredding and

01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,400
smelting and so forth and if you think

01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:00,560
about that

01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,760
the inputs to that system are the

01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,679
materials themselves

01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,520
and energy and then the outputs of that

01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:07,600
system are in the form of emissions and

01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:10,719
waste and what we did was we quantified

01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:13,040
that full life cycle and to see again

01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:14,719
where we might where we else we could

01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,120
look to really drive the sustainability

01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,199
of our

01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,239
equipment and it turns out there's an

01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:20,719
obvious place to look

01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:23,040
it turns out that this scope 3 content

01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:24,719
scope 3 emissions or embodied energy

01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,159
that's everything that's not in the

01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:28,800
operational phase

01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:29,520
for use in post use is a massive

01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,920
component

01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,719
of of the overall net carbon impact

01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,719
right

01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,159
and this is in this case this is an

01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,600
example where

01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:39,520
minerals were mined in the places that

01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,920
they are uh

01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,280
components manufactured in china and

01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,880
then in this case system and rack

01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,440
assembly done in eastern europe and a

01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:50,000
data center uh deployment done in sweden

01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,719
um and in this case more than three

01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,120
quarters

01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:55,120
of the total carbon impact comes from

01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,840
that scope 3 phase right so if that's

01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,520
true

01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,040
basically everything the majority is

01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,600
tied to manufacturing

01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,719
then what if we could defer that new

01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,760
manufacturing

01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:07,760
and it turns out that because uh because

01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,520
especially our upstream constituents the

01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,840
hyperscale data center operators

01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,639
refresh equipment very very quickly for

01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,880
good reasons

01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,080
right but oftentimes unnaturally fast

01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,000
compared to what the technology

01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:20,880
treadmill or the lifespan is

01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,560
a lot of this equipment has very

01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,480
attractive and interesting second life

01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,920
potential right circular economic models

01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,760
keep those assets in their highest

01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,199
utility value as long as possible

01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,280
so then the question is okay well what

01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:33,199
if we could enable a second life

01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,199
in this graph you see the green is the

01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,560
embodied or scope 3 content that is all

01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:38,960
of the carbon impact

01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,480
that's tied to the pre-use and post-use

01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,159
phase whereas the blue

01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:44,159
is the 22 percent that's tied to the

01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,880
operational phase so if we enable a

01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:47,920
second life

01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,440
you can see that the total carbon impact

01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,560
the co2 equivalents comes down

01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:53,360
significantly

01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,800
you have that 76 embodied content comes

01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,800
down by 52

01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,400
which is the largest driver of impact

01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,480
here and of course

01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,880
because uh the equipment is slightly

01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,199
older the operational energy used to run

01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,199
it

01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:07,360
increases slightly so you see that of

01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:10,480
that 22 percent that was operating

01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:11,360
uh carbon it increases by about 22 or 20

01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,840
percent

01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:15,520
but the net impact because that embodied

01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,480
content the scope 3 portion is so

01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,239
significant

01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,920
is that if you enable a second life for

01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:22,000
this equipment you can bring down the

01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,639
net co2 production or impact of the

01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,080
equipment

01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:27,360
by 24 nearly a quarter right and just to

01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,920
put that in context

01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,719
to deliver that same value from a carbon

01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,199
perspective

01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,800
by just focusing on the operating phase

01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:35,760
would require that we get another 68

01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,199
percent better

01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,800
and candidly we've done a really good

01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,719
job over the past decade of bringing

01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,840
down pue and making our data centers

01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,760
very very efficient

01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,000
so to think that we can achieve another

01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:48,719
70 gain in that space

01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,360
is a big ask right so this is a much

01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,360
lower

01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:53,520
hanging fruit if you will right to think

01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:56,560
about just buying second live creating

01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,239
second lives enabling circular economy

01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,760
but then of course there's an obvious

01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:01,920
question right

01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,040
what is it more expensive right if it's

01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,639
the right thing to do from a

01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,600
sustainability perspective is it gonna

01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:07,120
cost me more

01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,719
right and that's historically the

01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,639
mindset that has prevailed in in a lot

01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,719
of sustainability conversations

01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:14,000
and the reality here is that we fully

01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,320
understand we all

01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,080
understand that it cannot cost more it

01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,920
has to be also financially better

01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,679
and it has to be no less convenient no

01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,120
compromise to quality no compromise to

01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:25,280
performance any of that those are table

01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:28,159
stakes to any thinking about any of this

01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,679
and the good news is when you look at

01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:32,159
standard assumptions for

01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:34,000
you know depreciation rates for you know

01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:35,440
the costs of energy for utilization

01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,760
rates and so forth

01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,239
and factor in the fact that moore's law

01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,880
has slowed significantly

01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:44,080
make some logical assumptions about this

01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,840
and it turns out

01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,600
that by buying that secondary life

01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,320
creating a circular economic model

01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,600
the total system level total cost of

01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,719
ownership of the equipment

01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,480
also comes down by nearly 25 percent so

01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,600
in this case you truly have a win-win

01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:59,679
where you have

01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,280
uh you have a much better sustainability

01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,920
story if you can create this secondary

01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,520
life

01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,360
and you have a much better financial

01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,040
story so you're truly maximizing the

01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:08,639
lifetime value of equipment

01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,960
in its aggregate right which is the

01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:13,360
opportunity that we all have here

01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,080
um now i just want to step back and and

01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:17,040
anchor us

01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,920
on that 46 million server number to to

01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,239
give a sense of

01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,520
the potential magnitude of impact here

01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:23,760
if we were able to

01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,360
to create a second life for all of those

01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:27,920
46 million servers

01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:29,280
uh which is of course a a lofty and

01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,199
aggressive goal but if just

01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:34,320
theoretically we could do that

01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:36,080
we could save 31 million tons metric

01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,760
tons of co2

01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:39,679
and what is what does that mean right

01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,280
it's a it's a a big number

01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,880
well it means the equivalent of nearly

01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,960
seven million cars

01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,520
annual emissions so take seven million

01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,120
cars off the roads for an entire year

01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,280
and that's what we would get simply by

01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,960
saying hey let's take this equipment

01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,239
and run it for the for the lifespan that

01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,320
it was designed for and make sure that

01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:58,080
we're capitalizing on that full value

01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,080
and not you know kind of leaving a lot

01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:02,840
of value and waste on the table

01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:04,320
as a byproduct of our massively scaling

01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:07,199
infrastructure

01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,760
so what does this look like in uh in a

01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:09,600
picture

01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,280
so on this this is sort of our upstream

01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,120
downstream side slide

01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,400
the circular iit hardware industry right

01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,000
we have not you know

01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:18,159
the variety of hyperscale data center

01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,679
type operators on the left-hand side

01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:21,199
of course as we talked about it's sort

01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,560
of these cascading circles where you're

01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:24,239
keeping these the assets in their

01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,000
highest value as long as possible

01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:28,000
the first one of those being internal

01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,760
reuse it's obvious that that

01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,760
if we can actually keep some of this

01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,960
equipment in circular in circulation in

01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,639
its original home

01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,560
by just cascading it into perhaps

01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,440
secondary workloads that's a win for

01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,120
everybody

01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,960
that maximizes the financial value

01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:43,040
maximizes sustainability

01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,960
um but if we can't do that and there are

01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,560
very good reasons why that doesn't work

01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,600
for the majority of equipment in these

01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,840
hyperscale

01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,679
environments the next best thing is well

01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,400
let's take that 2000 pound rack

01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:56,480
do the necessary transformation to make

01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:59,119
it viable for the broader global markets

01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,159
but keep it as a 2000 pound rack right

01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:02,159
minimize the waste

01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:04,480
minimize the transformation necessary to

01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:06,239
keep to capitalize on the future value

01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:07,600
now if we can't do that there's this

01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:09,280
wonderful thing called edge

01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,800
which is starting to boom it's

01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,719
everybody's favorite buzzword right now

01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,199
and by some definitions edge is forecast

01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:16,239
to be

01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:17,760
as much as four times the size of the

01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:20,000
of the central cloud data center market

01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,480
from an i.t equipment perspective

01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,480
huge opportunity to take these same

01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:26,000
compute and storage nodes best-in-class

01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:28,080
hyper-scale technology

01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,600
and transform them into the form factors

01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,280
that might not look like racks

01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,040
but leverage the exact same compute

01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:35,199
power and storage capacity

01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,239
to fuel other edge and distributed

01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:38,480
applications

01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:40,000
and then of course if we can't do that

01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,600
then there's certainly value

01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,280
in harvesting the components

01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,800
recertifying those components

01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,719
selling those components into other

01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,960
systems and system builder environments

01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:50,639
and then we always recycle the rest of

01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,239
it as responsibly as possible

01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,760
uh and that's this is the business that

01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,639
it renews in and you can see here that

01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,480
the

01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:58,000
the markets that the equipment cascades

01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:59,679
into is

01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,920
you know as i mentioned cloud service

01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:02,560
providers retail environments telco

01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,080
environments

01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,600
enterprise at large we're doing work in

01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:07,360
healthcare gaming

01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,119
and and the enterprise more broadly

01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,800
right so what you get here when you do

01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:11,600
this is this kind of lifetime value

01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,199
multiplier

01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,960
where we're fully capitalizing and

01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,920
making sure that as little as possible

01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,080
of value

01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,679
is kind of falling falling through the

01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,800
cracks as we cascade through these these

01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:24,400
various different cycles of circularity

01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,000
so what does it take to deliver this

01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,080
right it seems a little bit daunting

01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,040
perhaps but the reality is

01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:33,119
it's happening today right and open is

01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,560
the critical enabler right so none of

01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:36,080
this would ever have been possible in

01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,320
the world of proprietary

01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,000
kind of vendor locked in systems but as

01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,320
the hyperscalers have moved

01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,520
to whitebox systems to odm systems to

01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,840
open compute

01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,600
that enables us it renew as the

01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,840
orchestrating engine of all of this

01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,400
to be to be able to do reconfiguration

01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:54,320
recertification some technical

01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,400
transformation and engineering work

01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,679
uh everything from firmware to storage

01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,159
integration to

01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:00,880
software validation and so forth to be

01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:04,159
able

01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:06,239
to then certify warranty benchmark and

01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:08,000
deliver these solutions into the market

01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:09,600
in the same way that you would expect

01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,199
from an oem solution right in other

01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,920
words no compromise to quality and

01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:13,600
performance

01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,280
fully warrantied think about these

01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,600
things as you know

01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:19,440
certified pre-owned bmws with 5000 miles

01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,560
on them right you expect exactly the

01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:22,159
same performance

01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,000
but you get a significant advantage in

01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:25,520
terms of cost and sustainability

01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,600
right so open hardware is the thing that

01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,639
enables all of this open systems

01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,760
firmware enables it

01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:32,159
of course these things are mostly

01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,560
running in linux heavy environments

01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:36,159
kubernetes and so forth so open source

01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,760
is really the catalyzing

01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:39,600
uh factor here and then of course

01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,679
there's a tremendous amount that goes in

01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,199
beyond an engineering work into the

01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:44,560
global operations and logistics

01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:47,199
footprint that it takes to

01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:49,040
to you know to do all of the reverse

01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:50,560
logistics and the flows of equipment

01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,239
and then of course the market making

01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,920
right what really

01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:55,600
is happening in addition to the services

01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,000
and solutions and products

01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,960
is we all need to come together to help

01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,560
this thing happen

01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,320
right as i talked about at the beginning

01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,600
it's an opportunity and we've seen from

01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,480
a financial and a sustainability

01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,560
perspective

01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:08,560
but it's also our imperative right we

01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,000
are we have a negative consequence to

01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,480
the power of our technology

01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,400
that is tied very much to the the

01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,159
resources that the software demands

01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,000
and the hardware that that that embodies

01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:19,040
those resources right so we need to come

01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,040
together and

01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:23,199
and move forward in a more sustainable

01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:25,520
model the good news is as i mentioned

01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:27,040
it's viable it's happening today the

01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,639
embodiment of this this connective

01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,920
tissue that connects those upstream

01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:31,920
upstream first lifetimes and the

01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,679
downstream second lifetimes is something

01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:37,040
called sesame by it renew

01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:39,679
this is a a full solution portfolio

01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,560
of rack scale hardware that it renew is

01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:43,440
providing

01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,840
proven hyperscale technology right as i

01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,520
said fully warranted fully supportive

01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,280
think about this again as a certified

01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,040
prion bmw

01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,320
dependably available at very large

01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,639
volumes right

01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,920
uh it is expected in the next couple of

01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,520
years that the top

01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,600
like seven or eight hyperscalers will

01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,520
decommission more equipment

01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,360
more than 10 million servers a year

01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:05,600
right much more equipment in the top

01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,360
five oems sell collectively right this

01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,840
is a massive stream of equipment

01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,800
it's available very dependably at very

01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,480
large scale

01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,080
which means that the downstream markets

01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,800
can depend on and can plan their

01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,199
roadmaps

01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,000
and their infrastructure on it reliably

01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,360
right

01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,840
something we haven't mentioned i talked

01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:23,760
about the system level tco before

01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,080
this is specifically the hardware tco

01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,040
here we are able to bring solutions to

01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:30,080
market that are

01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:32,080
30 to 50 percent more cost effective

01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:34,400
than a comparable oem solution

01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,199
and importantly that is normalized to

01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,960
performance

01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:38,880
right so again no compromise to quality

01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,119
fully warrantied no compromise to

01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,880
performance at the same performance

01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:44,880
whether that's cores per rack containers

01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,040
per rack users being served

01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,920
iops teraflops whatever your performance

01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,320
metric is

01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,280
30 to 50 better total cost of ownership

01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:53,360
and that's because

01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:55,119
of just the fact that it's circular

01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:58,000
re-certified equipment

01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:59,360
um give you a sense of of how what it

01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,480
takes to make these things viable for

01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,080
the broader markets

01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,679
has to be super easy right the

01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,600
downstream markets don't have the

01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:07,280
resources that the hyperscalers do

01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,639
so the solutions have to be plug and

01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:11,360
play integrated

01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,960
rack scale solutions that come with that

01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:14,560
are configured to meet the broader

01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,320
market needs whether those are

01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:18,000
our containerized environments those are

01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:20,159
virtual environments those are ai

01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,080
environments those are vdi environments

01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:23,600
you know converged environments whatever

01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,679
the model is

01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,280
full rack scale solutions can literally

01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:29,280
be wheeled in plugged in and played

01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,679
we're doing software certifications

01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,320
things like obviously the the kubernetes

01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,400
stack

01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:36,239
vmware and so forth right to meet the

01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:38,639
needs of the broader enterprise market

01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:40,080
that hasn't historically been able to

01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,800
take advantage of all this hyperscale

01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,400
innovation

01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,000
because the broader markets just don't

01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:45,040
have the resources and the supply chain

01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,040
isn't designed to

01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:49,520
to meet those needs and this is what

01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:51,600
this is the game changer on that

01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,440
so just coming back here to talk about

01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,280
you know why this is so important

01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,480
you know it's truly a win-win-win on the

01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:58,080
upstream side of the business

01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,239
think about if you're a hyper scaler and

01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,440
you can recover value

01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,880
from your decommissioned equipment

01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,239
that's tied to racks as opposed to

01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,360
components there's a significant

01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,960
opportunity there

01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,800
potentially as much as 50 billion

01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,199
dollars over the next 10 years

01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,800
for just the top like 10 hyperscalers

01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,920
right because they're recovering so much

01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,800
more value than they were able to

01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,880
historically

01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,719
because of this circular economic model

01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,080
on the downstream side

01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:21,760
we've done independent research with a

01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:24,159
third party that has characterized

01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,960
as much as a 10 billion dollar a year

01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:28,080
market

01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:30,960
for recertified open hardware this

01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:31,520
is places that are budget constrained

01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,000
that

01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:36,000
that need integrated solutions that want

01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,920
open and odm hardware have not been able

01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,360
to take advantage of it historically

01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,280
and want and want to be able to

01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:42,719
piggyback on and and

01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:45,119
slipstream behind this hyperscale

01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,880
innovation and those that creates

01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:48,080
motivation on both sides right which is

01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,199
which is the beauty of how this thing

01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,800
comes together

01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:53,119
talked about the sustainability and the

01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,199
system level tco benefit here

01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:56,159
significant opportunity for us all to do

01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:58,320
much better

01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:59,679
on both of those fronts and then lastly

01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,000
something i haven't touched on but is

01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:02,880
super

01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,679
important is that about between 40 and

01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,600
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:06,960
of the global population is still not

01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,280
online and

01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:11,280
the un sdg the sustainable development

01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,920
goals call for universal access that

01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,679
drives

01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,199
economic development and it drives

01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:17,199
equity and prosperity for

01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:18,880
all of us as a global community if we

01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:20,880
can get people online

01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,080
uh and digitally connected especially

01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,000
now in the era where

01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:25,280
telehealth and education and so much

01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,800
more is online

01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,639
and the problem here is that there's as

01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,400
much as a hundred billion dollar funding

01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,880
gap in getting that infrastructure in

01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,800
place

01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,800
now of course that's not all i t but if

01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,960
we can take these circular solutions

01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,239
and we can deliver infrastructure into

01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,719
parts of the world that are not yet

01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:41,520
online

01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:43,280
at much more cost effective uh you know

01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:45,199
in much more cost effective ways

01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:47,280
then we can accelerate the movement to

01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:49,280
universal access and that gets us

01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,480
on track to both a circular and a much

01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:53,520
more inclusive

01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,960
economy so we think this is a huge

01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,960
opportunity

01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,400
all of these uh factors come in

01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,159
beautifully together from a financial

01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:02,320
and sustainability and a human

01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:04,080
access perspective uh we're super

01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:05,520
excited to work with all of you on it i

01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:06,800
hope this has been interesting and i

01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:11,280
hope you have a great summit

01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:13,520
thank you very much

01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,719
thank you ali and thank you for all

01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,800
today's speakers

01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:18,000
i hope everyone enjoys the rest of

01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,320
today's sessions

01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,119
