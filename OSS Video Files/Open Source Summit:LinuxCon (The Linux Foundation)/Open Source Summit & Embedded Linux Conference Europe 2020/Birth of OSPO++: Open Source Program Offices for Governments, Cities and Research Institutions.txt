hello welcome to birthman oswal plus

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,120
plus

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,719
ospos for governments cities and

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
research institutions

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,200
quite the long title it would be longer

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,199
if we'd actually spelled out

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,480
ospo means open source program office

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,560
but it's probably a good thing to

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,359
clarify right at the beginning richard

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,359
probably a good thing so speaking of

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
which claire who are you

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,720
well my name is claire dillon i'm

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
speaking to you from dublin ireland

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
which

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,079
doesn't look as quite as sunny as it

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,280
does in the picture here today but i'm

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,880
delighted to be here

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,719
um and i work with moss labs

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,719
i also work with moss labs i'm richard

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,640
litter i'm calling in from

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,320
green vermont although it's slightly

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
more red and yellowish now

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,760
as fall has hit us and today we're going

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,280
to be talking about

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,120
open source so open source is

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,120
the future i believe if you're at this

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,079
conference you probably already know

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,000
this

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,760
open source is the practice of licensing

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,680
your code in a way that other people can

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,960
use it and modify it and adapt it

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
regardless of where they come from or

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
what they're doing and this has

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
generally led to a huge boom in

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,080
technology in the past 10 20 years

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,040
if not longer where now open source is

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,759
everywhere

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,479
so people are able to use code which

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,880
they haven't

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,080
paid for themselves to basically

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:27,280
accelerate

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:28,880
their work and as richard has said

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
it has definitely been the driver of the

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,439
tech economy for the last little while

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
we have been seeing huge growth across

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,000
all industries

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,840
and but i think one of the most

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,200
interesting things about open source in

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,360
the last little while

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,799
is the emergence of new business models

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,079
and value streams that have been

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,200
emerging because

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,320
it's not just about the idea that um you

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,159
know

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,240
which people had this idea in the past

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
that it was about hobbyist developers

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,479
building their passion projects

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,040
but these days there's serious money in

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,040
open source

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
part of that serious money basically has

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,360
to be funneled through corporate ospos

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,280
so as claire said earlier these are open

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,879
source program offices

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,800
and essentially if you have a large

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,560
like enterprise you need to have someone

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
who is managing what open source means

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
for that company

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,879
so these are the sort of six roles that

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
you have

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,640
within a corporate ospo and they do all

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,319
of these things first you have

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,400
policy experts people who are really

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,800
good at deciding what policy is going on

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
what

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
what license we want to use how do we do

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
that how do we

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
um integrate our ideology of open source

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
to our company and collaborate other

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,080
people

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,440
then you have compliance and legal well

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,959
are we making sure we don't have any gpl

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,160
licenses down the stack are we making

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,680
sure that we're not trading on anyone

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,599
else's patent toes

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
how are we going to do that and then

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,720
another job that the corporate

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
ospo has is measurement of open source

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
activity right so

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,680
how much open source we actually have at

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
this company how much are our developers

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,319
doing this in their spare time

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
how much are we working with other

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,680
people what other open source projects

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,040
do we depend upon

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,040
claire can you talk about the next three

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,760
points yeah i mean

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,920
alongside all the above the open source

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,080
program office also looks at educating

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,080
the developers about open source uh

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,680
coding the development practices the

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
tools the legal

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,879
issues that we've mentioned above also

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,040
they're often involved in

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,400
i suppose being the interface to the

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
various different open source

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,319
foundations

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,319
or the various different um institutions

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,360
that they may have to work with in order

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,959
to actually do their job

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,879
and they're also involved in this idea

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,319
of being an advocate for open source

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,720
within the organization

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,239
and providing communications around

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,159
their activities so that people

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,440
understand what's happening in open

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,120
source in these institutions

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,120
but i think when we think about osmo

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
plus plus we want to go

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
a little bit further because that

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,920
construct has worked incredibly well

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,519
in corporations and in fact the linux

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
foundation and the to do group have done

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
an awful lot of work to help

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,120
organizations understand what they look

00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,599
like and to get best practices around

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
this

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,680
but when we start to think about taking

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,080
that ospo construct

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,680
and actually bringing it to cities and

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,519
governments and universities

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
it can often look a little different

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,760
so part of that is you have to think

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,959
about other institutions cities and you

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
know governments and so on

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,240
and how do they have ozpos right what

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,120
does a university ospold look like

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
obviously it's going to be slightly

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
different you don't have just a

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,479
management structure that's hierarchical

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,479
it's much harder to make things move

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,680
fast in university settings we all know

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,919
and we'll get to more of the differences

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,800
later but for now think about this idea

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,639
of well what would it

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
look like for a city for a government et

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,440
cetera um

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,280
part of that is that osmo's don't just

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,199
cover source code they also cover

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,800
all sorts of other open things open

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,320
asterisks as i like to call it right

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,320
open data

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,560
open finance for some like ngos

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,440
open hardware open scholarship how do

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,320
you make sure that

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,919
academics are getting citations for

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,080
their work and getting it

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,680
recognized for it there's a whole ton of

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,320
things that go on

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,759
in that sort of setting but the main

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,199
thing that we want to talk about is the

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,639
plus plus for ospo

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
right for corporations you have just a

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,919
single ospo that runs that corporation

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
maybe they collaborate maybe they don't

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,800
the universities and cities and

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,479
governments these are institutions that

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,759
are based around community principles

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,199
from the get-go

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,800
and so we think instead of just having

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,759
an ospo there we should have a

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,080
collaborative

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,520
network of ospos that interface with

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,840
other ospos

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
and have a really structured way of

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,919
sharing

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
all the advances we have with open

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
source and how to build osbo so that

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,320
they can keep their costs down

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,240
while magnifying their effect

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,919
and it's really important because even

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,960
as we talked about the value of open

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,880
source earlier

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,080
when we think about that in the context

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,479
of uh

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,680
cities or regional governments or

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,680
universities

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,520
none of them can do what needs to be

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
done to solve the world's problems alone

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,080
so

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,520
you know in many respects you know it's

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,000
fine when you're thinking about building

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
the code

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,560
that your company is going to be

00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
commercially dependent on but when

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,400
you're thinking about solving the

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,240
world's problems

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
you kind of got to work together around

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
that so this idea of

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,440
being able to collaborate becomes much

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
much more important when we think about

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,680
these

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,680
constructs in a public setting

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,160
so we just talked about collaboration a

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,000
lot but why now in particular

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,639
well we think there's a couple of

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
reasons not regarding the huge amount of

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
political stuff happening in the states

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
at the moment

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,160
there are other global challenges that

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,360
can be met through collaborating between

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
ospos

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
great example would be climate change

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,400
there's a ton of work which is going on

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,919
into climate change which is open source

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,199
and if we collaborate on that it means

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,199
people don't have to keep reinventing

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
the wheel and that's a time-sensitive

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,440
issue

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,199
claire do you want to talk about social

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,880
impact yeah you know this is a passion

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,880
point from my perspective because

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
you know i i came to the open source

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,160
community and

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,280
i had already heard so much about the

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,840
idea of um

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,199
open source accelerating how you how you

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,039
build software and

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,039
the various different value around that

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,039
but for me one of the most important

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,319
things is this idea that open source can

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,400
help build trust

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,759
and with the users of the technology and

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,720
a great example of this

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,759
is um ireland's covert tracker app which

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
when it was built

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,919
um in collaboration between the health

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,360
service executive and a company called

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,039
near form in ireland

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
when they built that they decided to

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,599
open source the code

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,520
in order to allow privacy experts to

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,039
examine the code and give it a thumbs up

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,160
so that no one was going to say oh the

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,919
government is tracking my

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
my you know my whereabouts and all the

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,360
rest of us and they did that

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,800
and as a result it had one of the

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
fastest take-ups of

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
any app of its kind in the world and

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,479
like that had a dramatic

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,160
immediate effect on ireland's ability to

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,479
actually combat this disease so

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,479
it's it's just such a an important thing

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,960
these days because trust

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,160
between citizens and governments and

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,120
it's so important

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,120
when we think about digital

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,960
transformation that people get on board

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,520
with the technology that is being built

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,360
and maybe that it should be feeling like

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,520
it's a little bit more transparent

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879
and trustworthy and open source gives

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
you that which i think is incredibly

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
important

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,919
and as a result actually i think that

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,199
there have been a lot of public policy

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,160
changes that have been happening in the

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,919
last while

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
and for for the reasons we've already

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,400
mentioned because of the potential

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
commercial benefits or commercial impact

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,240
because it builds trust

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,759
but also in places like europe there's a

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
lot of conversation that's happening

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,720
around

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,199
um tech independence or or at least

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,560
removing the risk of being dependent on

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,840
any one corporation or country

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
and this brings us back to the

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,880
collaboration i mean really

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,919
when we think about when we're investing

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,240
public money in in creating the software

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,320
that's going to help us get the future

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,080
and it's really about this idea that we

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,680
should all be doing this together and

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
we should all be equal partners in this

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
so there's a lot of public policy

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
discussions that are going on at the

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
moment

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,839
and all around the world about making

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,839
that a reality

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
so one of the questions then is going

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,959
back to a previous point what does an

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
asphalt look like what does an optical

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,600
plus plus

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
look like uh when it's at a university

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,920
setting when it's in a governmental

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,120
setting

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,320
or you know in a city so one of the

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
first things that an hospital needs to

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,279
do there is

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,160
do an assessment of the ecosystem first

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
where is it

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,000
compared to other universities or other

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,279
cities or other governments and secondly

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
what's going on in its purview with its

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
citizenry

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,640
so if you have say a city which has an

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
osbo you need to see

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,839
what city services can be offered that

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
are open source what open source code is

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
already being used

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,600
are the people from your city which are

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,440
doing open source which could be brought

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,959
in somehow or supported

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
which is one of the other main points

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,480
right how do you support academics you

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
work with at your institution who are

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,680
making open source

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,200
code how do you support students who are

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,920
doing that how do you support

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,880
translation and research dissemination

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,760
and making sure that

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,120
their work gets out properly a lot of

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
people who write code aren't very good

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
marketers

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
right so an ospo should be part of that

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
as well

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,440
relationships and interface how do you

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,120
interface with other cities

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
right how do you make sure that your

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,880
code doesn't just live with you

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
and just open source is put out there

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,920
and nothing happens to it

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,160
one of the ways you do that is you have

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,920
collaborations how do you make sure

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,000
that that works that's kind of the job

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,839
of an oz pod there

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,040
and similarly to what we described in

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,040
the corporate ospo

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
looking at the skills required and

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,480
recognizing that the skills required

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,320
in the context of a city or a government

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,519
or university may be different than that

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,800
in a corporate context

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
so therefore we have to look at the

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,120
skills and again the awareness of the

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,320
activity and and making sure that people

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,959
understand what's happening

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
i mean these these are fairly similar to

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,120
the various

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,959
themes that we had in the corporate

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
hospital but maybe now richard we can go

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,519
into

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,760
what they may look like in the specific

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,040
context of both the university

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,720
and the the the municipal aspects

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,959
so let's look at the university of plus

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
plus

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,560
sounds good to me first one obviously is

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
research right universities are known

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,040
for doing a lot of research they're also

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,399
known for education

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,920
so we'll get to that in a second but

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,920
research is one of the main things we're

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,519
all supposed to do really really well

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,959
especially for organizations or

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,200
universities which

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,320
have a large research arm right you want

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
to make sure that that's getting out

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
there and that things are actually

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,560
changing the world this is great for

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,560
both the academics and the funders and

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,880
the university administration

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,880
everyone kind of wins here um

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
translation and dissemination is also

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,600
part of that

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,959
right so there's often a very large

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
section of the university that's just

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
called translation

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,880
that's one of the main goals of the

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,240
administration is making sure that the

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
work that's being done there

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,399
has an impact on the world and so being

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,839
able to amplify and accelerate voices

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,120
within the university is one of like

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,680
the core parts of the university ospos

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
education and skills if i can interrupt

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,760
you there richard we've heard from

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,000
people

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,160
in universities like for example syed

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,839
chaudhry who is the director of the open

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,560
source program office in johns hopkins

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,200
university

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,760
and he talks a lot about this idea that

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
and

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,279
that that artifact that result of

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
research that is

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,839
software is such a valuable thing but so

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,560
many universities

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,279
only measure their ability to monetize

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,000
ip

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,440
around that software and if you only do

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,360
that you're only going to get a small

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,320
percentage of all the available software

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
that might be available in the

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
university

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,480
but if you think about the idea that

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,040
that software could actually have

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
an impact even if it isn't got even if

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,639
it hasn't got

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,920
an immediate monetary value and it could

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,320
still have an impact

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,320
and therefore it's another pathway for

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,399
universities to be able to translate

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,839
that research into impact

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,600
of course part of making sure that your

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,600
translation is working is also

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,200
working with future translation efforts

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,959
which means training

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
current students to be able to do open

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,079
source effectively

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,000
and not just open source code we already

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,279
have that in say our cs programs

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,480
but also training people to run ospos at

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,160
universities

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
building the next generation of leaders

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,079
who are good at

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,079
you know purveying open source gospel

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,600
around the world

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,440
also a very important part of the

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
corporate osbo

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
also a very part of the university osfos

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,680
which we need to think about when we

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,920
think about what it looks like

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,760
and back to having social impact and

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,560
local impact for universities

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,519
so often the universities have a

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,079
priority

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,000
to make sure that they are giving a

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,200
benefit back to whatever community they

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,839
actually exist in

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,200
and we know that the the programs around

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,880
open source program offices and

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,519
universities can often have that as a

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,360
goal

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,880
and again looking to johns hopkins

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
there's a wonderful example they have

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,240
there of the work that they have done

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
with saint francis neighborhood centers

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,040
in baltimore's uh city center

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,720
where they've taken open source code and

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,720
with the students getting involved

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,880
they've actually been able to

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
have real impact on the ground with

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
software that

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,959
those neighborhood centers wouldn't

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,560
ordinarily be able to access

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,240
and do it in super quick time because

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,639
they were able to collaborate using open

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,800
source

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
so it's a fantastic way for for for

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,839
universities to be able to have

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,600
a real immediate social impact in their

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,560
environment

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,880
and for funding too in terms of actually

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,120
the

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
the ospo being a center for being able

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,560
to interface with

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,600
with various other ospos and with

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,519
institutions

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,199
and with funding bodies per se as well

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,639
because with all the public policy

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,199
changes that is happening

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,040
around open source there is a lot more

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,680
funding available that has this

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,279
this explicit stipulation that the end

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,680
result has to be open

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,360
and in that respect and osmo plus plus

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,079
can actually identify those funding

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,800
opportunities

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,240
and even create joint submissions um

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,240
within a network

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
uh so that so that universities can go

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,760
after that so

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,959
um it can be an important focal point

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,839
for actually bringing funding

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,839
into a university

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,519
so that covers osmo's at the university

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,240
level municipal levels are slightly

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
different

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
but also kind of the same that's why

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,079
we're putting them both under the osmo

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,079
plus plus

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,600
heading one of the things that's really

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,480
important for cities

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,680
as opposed to say universities um where

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,120
it's also important too

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,839
don't get me wrong but it's really

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,639
important to have transparency and trust

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,360
um our modern democracies for those of

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,000
us who are in

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,199
awesome democracies depend upon trust

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
and citizen services depend upon the

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,240
citizens knowing that their vote matters

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
and that their politicians are looking

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,279
out for them

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,560
in some way now this is kind of at the

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,240
ideological level

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,199
uh often it doesn't really seem that way

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
if you ask the average person on the

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
street do you trust your government well

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,720
no not really

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,279
but with open source that's particularly

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,199
true

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,040
and it really helps this whole process

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,120
along claire made a really good example

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,199
earlier about the covet tracing app

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,399
in ireland which was a government

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,560
initiative right

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,920
and by being open source it was they

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,120
were able to engender trust in the

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
populace because people were like oh

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,759
yeah that looks pretty good we haven't

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,800
had a ton of security experts saying

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,639
this is awful

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,480
or if they did say that we worked in

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,959
those bugs very early

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,800
go ahead claire i have another one um i

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,360
was speaking earlier about the

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,639
the work that johns hopkins has done in

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
saint francis neighborhood centers in

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,360
baltimore i remember being part of one

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,040
of the events

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
in baltimore where they were talking

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,440
about um the ability

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,959
for citizens to get engaged in that

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,240
software and to actually have the

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,399
accessibility to

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,759
to kind of make changes to that software

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,279
can really help

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,199
uh change how the citizens feel about

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,320
their relationship with the technology

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,560
providers because i

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,440
there was one phrase that really stuck

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,680
with me

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,560
one of the participants said we feel

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,279
often like

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
like technology is being done for us but

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,720
actually we want it to be done

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,079
with us and i think that that's such an

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,880
amazing way to look

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,240
at how open source can be employed by

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
municipal and governments

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,360
and municipalities and governments

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,800
because really

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,240
if we want citizens to get engaged

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,399
with the future and digital

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,160
transformation then then giving them the

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,320
opportunity to see what's going on

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,519
and even maybe participate in that

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,279
community is is a huge benefit

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,880
which segway is right into point two

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,600
which is scaling municipal services

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,799
um lutes is an open source platform

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,439
that's used to do participatory

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
budgeting

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,640
so that citizens can actually decide

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,160
where budgets go this is used by the

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
city of paris at the moment as well as

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,559
budapest and baltimore

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,160
so it's a trans country transcontinental

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,000
thing which is open source

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,439
and allows people to actually say we

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
need more garbage collectors in

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,199
our around the smell right and so people

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,360
have actually said that they

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
feel more like they're part of the

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,839
system like they're

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,200
actually doing something that matters

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,559
and that they can see real changes on

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,480
the governmental level

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,600
which from a european perspective is

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,840
amazing because that isn't something

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,679
that people often say

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,200
and that that example of the test is a

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,799
brilliant one because it was actually

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
the foundation of the work that was done

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,120
in baltimore

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,640
but i've heard that recently it's

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,039
actually been taken and and

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,919
it's been implemented now in budapest as

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
well so

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,600
when we think about scaling these

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,280
municipal services it's not just even

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,200
on the ground in the cities where

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,039
they're created but then that source

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,679
code can actually be used around the

00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,679
world

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,360
very quickly with with low effort and

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,280
resources can be reused

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
and for great again great benefits for

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,799
the citizens which is

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,559
and when when the new citizens see it

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,760
working in a previous city it can really

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,480
it can really help us

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,919
get off the ground even quicker it also

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,440
help with policies you know policies

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,400
used in one city are often adaptable to

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,039
another one

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,760
so it really scales that out which means

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,400
less money

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,360
less time just movement and progress

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
going forward

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,720
and involving the citizenry which is

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,000
excellent also makes it much

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,240
go it also helps to have

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,280
um you know some expertise in the

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,679
municipal osbo

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,400
around policy development because so

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,200
often

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,840
uh people like these ideas but don't

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,360
really understand the practical steps

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,760
that they may have to go through

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,760
in order to make them a reality so one

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,919
of the real core competencies

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,280
that's very particular to a municipal

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,320
osbo um

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,720
is is that ability to understand how to

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,919
make

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,160
policies real um and how to use

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,760
the osbo as an instrument to make that

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,440
policy real and impactful within a city

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,679
also how to influence and advocate other

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,200
cities and more collaborations

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,640
and make sure that there's someone there

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
who is actually being the champion for

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,360
open source

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,720
that's part of the point of the ospo to

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,520
hold a vessel for these people to do

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,840
their work

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,120
so that open source code can really help

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,679
people out

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,679
but there's also a lot of food or fear

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,000
uncertainty or doubt that still lingers

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,240
in the

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
system around open source and you know

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,520
um i

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,679
i i kind of you're very you're very

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,360
aware that some of the stories that were

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,799
surrounding you know the narratives that

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,600
were surrounding open source from

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,160
say 20 years back are still prevalent uh

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
today

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,600
when when people who are not familiar

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,880
with the great advances that have

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,559
happened in this ecosystem

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,160
if they're not familiar with those they

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,840
still think that it's a it's a group of

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,559
hobbyists who are

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,440
building whatever their their hobbyist

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,600
projects but they

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,640
they're not probably aware of the

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,919
amazing

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,880
um structure and the maturity of the

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,559
whole open source

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,000
ecosystem so it's it's incredibly

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,159
important to have someone

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,039
who can watch out for that and then to

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,720
be provide

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,240
this again center of excellence for

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,400
understanding uh

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,679
where the open source community has come

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,720
to and

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,720
and help share that news

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,440
part of influencing and advocating for

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,000
open source and osbos in general is of

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,919
course telling

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
stories so i run a podcast called

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
impactful open source where i look at

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
these stories of how source code has

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,159
gone through

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,960
cities governments organizations ngos

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,480
etc

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,559
particularly through osbos and the osw

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,159
plus plus network

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,760
and shows where open source has actually

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,360
made a real change in the world

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,880
so we're actively trying to collect

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,600
these stories if you have some

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,280
i would love to hear them and the goal

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,039
there is to make it easier for everyone

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,360
else to say osbos exist and we should

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,840
have one at our city

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
which is exactly what we said in ireland

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,440
um

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,240
so i'm i'm very happy to share that in

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,000
ireland

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,679
uh liro which is the irish software

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,799
research center um

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,400
has formed a new ospo and is part of the

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,720
ospo plus plus network

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,440
um and it's very new in ireland and

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,919
we're still

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,679
working around what that will look like

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,039
but we've already had

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
the first meetings of that ospo plus

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,120
plus

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,240
um group with the researchers in ireland

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
that are interested in this and it's

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,720
already

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,640
yielding results where where the

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,080
researchers involved were able to share

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
their challenges and share best

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,400
practices around this so

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,880
it becomes immediately apparent of the

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,799
value of having a central point

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,240
for researchers to gather around and

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,720
tell their stories and hopefully we'll

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,640
get to

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,640
be on the podcast uh soon richard

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,760
you will be uh one of my first guests

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
was actually syed chowdhury who you

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,440
mentioned earlier who is

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,120
running the ospo at johns hopkins he's

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,799
done amazing work there

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,799
particularly with covet actually they

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,320
built a wonderful atlas of

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,159
what's happening with cobit during the

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,120
world which was a collaborative open

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,039
source effort

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,039
so we talked about that on the podcast

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,760
and also he's just a great example of

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,919
how to build an osbo at a university

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,600
another great story of ospo's coming out

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,799
of the osbo plus plus network

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,799
is open at rit with stephen jacobs rit

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,880
is a fairly large university in upstate

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,240
new york that does a ton of research and

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
stephen jacobs has set up there the

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,919
first real program for teaching students

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,200
how to do open source

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,200
and also getting them jobs and

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,159
collaborative efforts and making sure

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
that

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,400
it fosters the whole culture of open

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,159
source at the university level and works

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,320
with other universities as well

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,960
right so he's been working together with

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,480
saeed and others in osbo plus plus

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,400
so it makes it easier for him to get

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,080
this off the ground

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
probably one of the better examples of

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,240
this as well is cross

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,200
cross is the center for open source

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,400
research

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,159
at uc santa cruz uh run by carlos

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,280
maltsson ensemble eg

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,960
stephanie legi and what they've done is

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,880
they got a large grant from sage weil

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,760
who runs seth which is a large storage

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,760
program

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,440
and that grant allows them to actually

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,840
foster graduate students

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,799
to work on the work that they want to do

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
with help

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,320
and funds from corporate sponsors so

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,640
that

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,000
at the end of their you know phd they

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,520
have a job waiting for them because

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,400
they've already been doing open source

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,039
the entire time so how do you combine

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
together

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,480
academia with research uh cross is a

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,760
great example of this

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,400
another one would be brandeis

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,320
not only is it a great example of what

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,440
you can do within the university but um

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,080
i think even back to the point of uh

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,240
how you can get investment through your

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,440
activities in open source um one of the

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,840
other reasons why cross

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,760
is incredibly uh great story is that

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,320
they are cash positive i believe so

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,159
um it's it's it's marvelous to see uh

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,919
such an initiative actually be able to

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,960
get a return on investment of up from

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,400
their activities

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,640
speaking of returns on investment

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,039
brandeis right now is running the first

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,320
basically ospo plus plus training camp

00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,440
where they have a program at the

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,799
university to teach

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,400
people how to become heads of osbos

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,000
it's very easy to find you know open

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,840
source courses or a professor who

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,919
teaches open source or

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,520
a way of doing that at a university

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,880
level in a sense of like having a

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
student who likes open source can be

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,400
supported in some way

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,000
ad hoc it's very hard to find a

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,679
university that's dedicated

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,679
from the administration down from the

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,520
courses down in teaching people

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,200
how to open source in the future

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,960
brandeis is the first of this

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,880
and it's super exciting to watch them

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,039
investing in the entire ecosystem

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,480
from the get-go

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,799
which is what we're doing at oddball

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,320
plus plus so we're trying to make sure

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,480
that we hold a space for people to have

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,960
these conversations around what osbos

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,559
are

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,320
how to work together collaboratively and

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,240
how to do it at the city level you know

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,159
government level and how to effectively

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,080
strategize to do that effectively

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,159
i think some of the learnings that have

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,039
happened uh from the ospo plus plus

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,520
working group

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,880
have already been incredibly helpful for

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,080
anyone who's starting up

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,600
their own ospo or in fact even

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,200
a long way down the road because

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,640
everyone has unique challenges and the

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,000
sharing has been incredible

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,760
and but one of the things that i have

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,799
found again

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,200
incredibly um impressive is is that

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,039
we've

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,640
we're already seeing collaborations

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,000
coming out from this working group it's

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,799
only been in place a couple of months

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,919
but we've had

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,760
uh joint funding uh proposals in place

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,080
uh there are discussions going on now

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,159
for collaborations across curriculum

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,640
development and skills programs

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,240
and so i think it's a it's a marvelous

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,120
working group to be part of

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,640
um and i hope we can find some more

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,400
great participants um

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,159
from this pod from this presentation

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,679
and richard it probably would be a good

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,159
idea for us to actually share

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,200
how people can actually get in contact

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,159
with us if they want to find out more

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,320
most likely send an email to info

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:54,480
mosslabs.io

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
uh we will respond so we're very very

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
excited to have

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,880
pretty much anyone who's interested in

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,480
building an osbo and connecting to other

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,000
people join us

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,400
we have a website which is nascent so

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,120
the url will be out by the time this is

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,960
released

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,159
which is exciting there's impactful open

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,440
source uh

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,919
the podcast which you can look up on

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,039
apple on spotify and go ahead and listen

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,400
to that

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,720
and for now that's the email it's right
