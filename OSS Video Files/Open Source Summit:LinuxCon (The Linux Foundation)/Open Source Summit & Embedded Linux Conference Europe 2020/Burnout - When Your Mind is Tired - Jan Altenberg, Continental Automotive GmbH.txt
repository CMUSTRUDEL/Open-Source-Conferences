okay

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,440
hello everyone so my name is

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,640
jan i'm working for continental

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,920
automotive

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,480
well i've been presenting

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,199
at the erce and open source summit quite

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,080
a few times before

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,840
so but actually this is the first time

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
where i'm not really speaking about a

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,320
technical

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,600
topic even though it is

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,239
a topic that really pretty much affects

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,680
interestingly many many technical

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,480
persons

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,039
so this year i'm going to speak about

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,039
burnout

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,280
so just to make one thing clear

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,719
i am it's not my intention to give a

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,719
like a medical or scientific correct

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
description about this topic

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,920
so i'm i'm not a medical doctor neither

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,280
a psychologist nor therapist

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,159
i'm an engineer and this is basically

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,200
um yeah the point of view from which i

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,080
would like to

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,960
to look into this topic so it's it's

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,040
really pretty much

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,720
as you will see from my own experience i

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,119
would like to dive into it

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,000
into this topic and well at the end of

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,560
the day raise a bit

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,880
of awareness of this thing which is

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,479
actually becoming unfortunately

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,200
a increasing problem so

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,079
before we go on um let's have a brief

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,439
look at the

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,119
agenda so um actually i would like to

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
start to give you a bit more background

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,840
why i decided to

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,560
present about this topic

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,640
i well we will look into what is burnout

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
how does it look like and how can we

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,719
spot it we'll have a

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,799
closer look about the symptoms and how

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,399
they evolve over time

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,920
um we'll talk a bit about how we can

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,680
deal with burnout and and

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
for all these steps we'll just not look

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,160
into from from one perspective we'll try

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,879
to cover this from different perspective

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,440
like from the perspective of a affected

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,920
person

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,720
from a co-worker or from a team lead so

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,680
how can we

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,640
deal with the things and how can we help

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,920
out

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,640
and well most importantly we'll also

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,680
have a look

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,720
at i mean what can we do to

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,000
avoid burnout situations

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,680
okay so but um well first of

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,040
all why did i decide to talk about this

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,239
topic

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,599
um actually i thought about this quite

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,959
some time

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,000
but i never really got the motivation to

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,760
to make a presentation

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,640
about this and then at this year's

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,360
fosters first them early this year

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,000
i saw a presentation by andrew hutchings

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
um

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,519
which was called recognizing burnout

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,840
that was a

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,360
very very good presentation so thank you

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,640
so much andrew for giving this

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,920
presentation and

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,200
that finally got me the motivation um

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,760
to to go ahead with this talk

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,840
um so at the end of the day um as you

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,239
can imagine

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,000
my motivation is coming from personal

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,760
experience

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,840
so i felt burnout some years ago

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
and i i had to take some time off

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,480
actually

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,720
at the end of the day i've been quite

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,680
lucky even though

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,360
it was i have to admit a very unpleasant

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
experience

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,799
and well during that time i've been a

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
team leader

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,480
responsible for a team of engineers and

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
well after my personal experience i i

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
decided that

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,680
i will do the best i could probably

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
i probably can to avoid that one of my

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,560
team members

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,560
is going to to a similar situation

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,120
and what happened

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,640
is actually then one of my team members

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,200
suffered a burnout

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,840
and to be honest this is still something

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,400
that

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,920
bothers me and makes me thinking because

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
well

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,079
you all think what what could i have

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,199
done better um is there something i

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
could have done

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,040
um and and i think this this is for me

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,280
still more bothered some

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
than my own experience that i was not

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
able to avoid this unpleasant experience

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,479
for

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,240
for my team so this gave me the

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,600
motivation

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
to look into this topic i did a lot of

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
reading

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
i talked to many people to many affected

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
persons

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,680
to just discuss the experience

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,000
what i realized at the end of the day

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,440
there are actually many many affected

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
persons so that was

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,120
was really surprising that many people

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
even if my

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720
many of my friends actually knew about

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,199
this topic

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
um have been affected by this topic or

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
at least

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,880
know someone who was affected so

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,479
i easily realized that this is

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,080
definitely becoming an increasing

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,800
problem

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
but at the same time i could also see

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,160
that

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,280
there is still a big lack of awareness

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,840
in communities

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,720
also in companies people do not really

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
know how to deal with burnout and and do

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,919
not really have a feeling what what

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
what turnout really is and this is the

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,160
intention of this presentation

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,840
to give a bit more background and to to

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,280
raise the awareness about this topic

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,199
okay so first of all um

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,639
we're gonna start with the question what

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,919
is burnout

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,199
it sounds like an easy question

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,080
but to be honest it is actually

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,440
not easy to answer because burnout is a

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,840
very complex topic

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,479
with many many different aspects so it

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,440
is

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,680
very individual looks different from

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,720
person to person

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,520
if i should summarize the topic i would

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
say

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
it is a state of mental and physical

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,400
exhaustion

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,400
which is at the end of the day usually

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,240
leading to a collapse

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,000
the root cause of this state of

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,120
exhaustion is

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,840
long-term unresolved stress

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,880
and when you do a bit of reading you

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,919
will often read

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,280
the definition of long-term work-related

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,080
stress

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,600
and i highly disagree with this

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,479
definition so i would say

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,960
it is not necessarily work-related

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
stress

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
at the end of the day

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,039
the cause is stress

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
but even still the world health

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,120
organization grades it as a phenomenon

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,039
caused by work-related stress

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,720
once again i'm not a medical doctor but

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,560
i highly disagree with this

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,680
so i would say it is caused by

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
unresolved stress

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,360
but since it is not work related i would

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,960
say the risk is not related to any age

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
or to your job or to your work

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,720
experience

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,199
it can basically hit each and anyone

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
and well how does it look like

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,919
pathologically

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,720
the symptoms are at the end of the day

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,080
in my opinion not distinguishable from a

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,319
depression

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,360
um what might be different is the

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,479
context so it

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,800
is the root cause is stress related

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,319
but the symptoms are very very similar

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,319
so now

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
that we say it is similar to a

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,840
depression so we might get an

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,560
understanding that we're talking about a

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,000
very serious disease

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,880
um well still there is raising awareness

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,960
but

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,039
we're still on a way to understand this

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,680
problem and just to to prove that there

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,479
was

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,639
lack of attention for quite some time

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,520
even the world health organization

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,919
um did not great burnout as an official

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,599
disease before 2019

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,919
so just last year burnout has been added

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,879
to

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:06,160
icd-11 which is the 11th edition of the

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,800
international classification of diseases

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,680
just so that means that just one year

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
ago

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,319
world health organization put burnout on

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,400
their official catalog

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,599
of diseases so

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,800
okay now that we talked a bit about

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,440
what is burnout i would like to start

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,879
with a couple of risk factors so because

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
that that was the thing

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,919
what i started with when i tried to

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,399
understand this

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,479
problem and when i realized that there

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
are so many people affected i try to

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,479
understand

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,039
what is the root cause why are so many

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,080
people

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,920
suffering burnouts these days so

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
i try to figure out what are the risk

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,640
factors that are causing

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,959
stress and frustration and basically

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,160
stress and frustration is the root cause

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,519
for burnout situations

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,160
so let's have an overall look of which

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,680
risks

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,720
we have nowadays so a big issue

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,360
i see is that nowadays we

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,200
are always on we are constantly

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,680
available for each and everyone you know

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,080
we have smartphones we have computers

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,320
we can be reached by social media by

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,440
email by phone

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,200
everywhere at any time and

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,000
i mean this was not the case 20 years

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,560
ago and

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
um nowadays it's really that you have

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,680
actively

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,920
to take some time off so you have to

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,880
actively decide that you don't want to

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
be reachable

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,160
or that you do not want to communicate

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,240
so

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,000
this is definitely a big risk that we

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,279
are always reachable

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,080
and have to actively take a step back

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,519
at the same time we have a big

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,200
information overload

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
we have so many options to get

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,880
information we have

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,839
to deal with so many different sources

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
of information

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,320
we have to create that information and

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,440
together with this constant availability

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
i mean we

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,560
our mind has to deal with that this is

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,880
very stressful for us

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,360
and we need well we have to learn to

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,399
take our time off

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,240
um another issue i see and that's

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
actually also very interesting is bad

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,440
communication

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,519
what i find interesting here is that

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,000
i mean we have so many new ways to

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,519
communicate so we're always reachable

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,480
we're always on but we just use

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,399
the well the the all these options for

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
communication just the wrong way

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,640
instead of just efficiently exchanging

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,880
the information that is needed

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,880
we always put the pressure for enough on

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
us that we need to communicate that we

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,440
want to be reachable

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,680
and that we exchange information if even

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,000
if it's not unneeded so it's a bit that

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,800
we have so many options to communicate

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,839
but we

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,480
just um use it the wrong way so i think

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,440
this is a

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
big and growing problem in our society

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
and

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,120
definitely one of the root causes why um

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,399
yeah so many people are suffering

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
stress-related diseases

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,200
so for sure there's many

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,880
other um personal risk factors

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,120
um and it's not it's not just one factor

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,839
so usually it's a combination of things

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
right

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,240
so from a personal perspective what is

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
always a risk is a high workload

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
so it's not just a high workload but

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,880
high workload can always be a risk

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,519
for sure stress and once again not only

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,480
work related

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,279
extremely high ambition can be a risk

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,040
because

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,640
if you have high ambition and this is

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,560
the case for most of the technical

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,120
people

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,560
it's hard for you to take a step back

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,760
and it's hard to accept that you need a

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,959
break

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,440
this definitely can be a risk another

00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,760
risk

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,040
is that you do not really take your time

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,279
off and

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,760
it's not about the amount of time so

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,079
when i prepared that slide

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,000
i discussed a bit with a friend and

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,120
originally i wrote here not taking

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
enough time off

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,639
and during the discussion we came to the

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,680
conclusion that no it's not about the

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,720
amount of time it's

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,399
about the quality of time so you need to

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
take your time off that would mean

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,000
you don't read your emails you you

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,880
switch off your phone

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,360
so you just take the time for the things

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
um

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,040
you love and you're interested in so

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,839
it's about the quality of the time you

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,880
have

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,120
um because if you don't do that um you

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,000
start mixing up shop in spare time

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,200
and this is definitely something very

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,399
problematic

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,399
and is also well known course for stress

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,279
so for sure there are also risk factors

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,399
that can be given by a company by a team

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,800
or by working together in a community

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,639
and also the first point here was um

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,880
given by a friend of mine and i think it

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,639
it is a very good point

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,480
this is a classic specifically in

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,880
companies that you

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,079
have unclear role definitions or the

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,560
tasks that are

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,399
put on a person are not fitting the

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,279
specific rule

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,519
because that that might cause that

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,279
people feel overwhelmed with the tasks

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,399
they have to do

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,480
they might get frustrated because they

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,200
don't have an idea what is really their

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,079
role or what what is expected from them

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,320
and this is definitely a risk because

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,959
this can come without any attention so i

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,000
mean

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,519
if you just start up with a new team um

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,760
you you don't do the proper role

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
definitions um so you

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,120
i mean you just forgot something there

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,199
was nothing you

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
actively did wrong or it's just

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,519
something you forgot but that could

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,360
cause

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,959
um stress and frustration because people

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
just could not deal with the tasks they

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,120
get on

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,720
their desk another point

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,639
is missing appreciation this is also

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
very important and the common things

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,560
everything in companies

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,959
um i mean you need to receive some

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,360
appreciation for the work you do

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,480
and i mean it's it's not just about the

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,839
appreciation

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
being there it's about i mean the

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,920
appreciation has to be

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,160
actively communicated and i mean if you

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,800
don't receive appreciation for the work

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,959
being done

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,800
you get frustrated and you get stressed

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,000
out

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,320
i mean both topics that i mentioned here

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
before are also closely related to

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,120
leadership

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,639
in a community or in a team so if you

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,320
have bad leadership or lack of

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,120
leadership in a team

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,320
this will definitely influence the way

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,920
of working

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,040
and this definitely can frustrate people

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,880
and also closely related to this topic

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,519
it's communication um if a team

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,880
communicates bad or does not communicate

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,880
at all

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,320
this this is a serious issue and it's

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,959
it's really a topic where we

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,720
should have a closer look then because

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,320
one of the main learnings i had in my

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,440
professional career is

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,079
that having a good culture of open and

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
transparent

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,760
communication is really important so if

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
you fail with that you will completely

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,480
fail

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,440
and that communication topic

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,079
is a big and underestimated risk factor

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,360
in a team

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:30,639
so that can lead to a lot of

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,720
frustration and to a lot of stress

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
and what is important to understand here

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,959
is that

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,040
bad communication is definitely an issue

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,160
but the biggest problem is the

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,920
communication

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:47,040
that is not happening at all so

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,360
that might sound a bit weird but there

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,079
is

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,120
a very nice example here so there's a

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,279
short story given by paul watslavic

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,360
he was a austrian communication

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,720
scientist

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,440
and he gave as an example

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,279
a short story which is like there's this

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,600
guy who wants to hang a picture

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,959
so but he just has the picture and he

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,839
has a nail

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,399
so he's just he just needs a hammer but

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,920
he doesn't

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,040
own a hammer so he cannot hang the

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,839
picture so what comes to his mind is

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,279
he could ask his neighbor for a hammer

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,519
but then

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,440
he thinks okay but can i ask him because

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,440
yesterday my neighbor didn't really say

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,959
hello to me and he looked pretty pretty

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,360
strange and

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,360
now that that i think about it he never

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,839
really said hello to me

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,680
um so

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,199
what's the problem with this guy i mean

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
if he doesn't really say hello to me

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,440
he's got a problem with me

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,199
and obviously he won't borrow me his

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,680
hammer right so i mean but

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,639
that's that's not nice from him so i

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,800
mean i would

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,000
give him everything he needs so and the

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,920
story continues

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,120
and he's doing circus in his head and at

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,600
the end of the day

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,680
what he basically does is he goes to the

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,360
neighbor's house he knocks the door

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,799
the neighbor opens the door and he just

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,400
yells at him well

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,480
just keep your hammer you bastard

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,400
this is i pretty much like this example

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,520
because we can see that

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,240
there's a serious conflict obviously

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,559
coming out of nothing because there was

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,959
no communication happening at all

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,079
the whole story was going on in the head

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,520
of one person

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,360
and if he would have spoken which means

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
that he would just have asked for the

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,039
hammer

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,360
there won't be any issue at all so

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,840
um and i'll come back to this point over

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,160
and over again

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:45,039
communication is important

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,039
and it is a key aspect

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,400
okay so now that we spoke about

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,640
what is burnout and what are risk

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,160
factors i would like to speak about

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,039
typical symptoms

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,120
that people show who are getting

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,480
stressed out

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,640
um so once again this is very individual

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,919
this can look very different from person

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,559
to person

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,559
um but these these are the most common

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,799
ones and usually it's it's a combination

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,559
of symptoms that usually evolve over

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,919
time so we'll come back to that

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,880
but so the classical ones are problems

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,720
to concentrate

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,360
that's usually the starting point so

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,960
people easily get distracted

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,120
therefore their work is getting less

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
effective

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,799
you have a and i i can confirm that from

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,799
my own experience you have a continuous

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,039
feeling of tiredness and you remember

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,799
the title um of the presentation is when

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,720
your mind is tired

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,559
and this definitely you have this is

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,120
definitely the case we have a continuous

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,520
feeling of tiredness

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,160
this usually goes along with physical

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,520
problems

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,520
so like continuous headaches or

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,520
getting sick on a frequent basis

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
um

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,679
so um

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,120
um also a very common thing is

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,760
that you have sleeping problems

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,200
and so that the thing is you you cannot

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,200
really get into sleep

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,679
therefore you you you have trouble

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,160
getting out in the morning

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,039
um so and for sure that that really adds

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,840
up with the

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,840
um continuous feeling of tiredness you

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
have

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,559
so for sure there are also some real

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,280
more serious problems like

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,960
losing interest in activities like

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,440
sports and hobbies so

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,400
this is basically when you come to that

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,919
point

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,520
um you you're definitely um getting into

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,480
serious trouble because

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,559
um this is these are typical symptoms of

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,240
a depression so if you lose interest in

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,760
things that have been important for you

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,720
before

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,480
this also usually goes along with the

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,799
reduction of personal contacts

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,880
also many times other changes in

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,480
behavior like the extroverted person

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,840
getting introverted

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,440
a calm person easily gets stressed

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,880
so or many other changes

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,520
in in behavior of a person and also one

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,600
very classical thing is

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,679
escaping into other things so people

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,320
somehow realize that something is going

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,440
wrong but

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,360
you just escape from it um so the escape

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,280
is usually some kind of addictive

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,840
behavior

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,080
that could be classical addictive

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,440
behavior

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,280
but like alcohol abuse or whatever

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,720
but this could also be doing something

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,120
like extreme sports

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,320
um training seven days a week two times

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,480
a day or

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,240
i don't know doing base jumping whatever

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,080
just um escape

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,919
from the problems that you somehow

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,559
realize but you you just

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
escape from it

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:19,120
so now all of these symptoms

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,520
they usually add up over time

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,600
they do not come from one day to another

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,720
so therefore we have to be the look at

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,480
how things evolve

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:32,000
over time and um

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,120
a very common thing is and that many

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,159
affected person can

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,080
can confirm that is that people start

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,400
doing vicious circles

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,840
um you could draw these vicious circles

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,159
for any of the symptoms i've i've shown

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,159
before and

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,720
but the classic thing is how our burnout

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,720
evolves is that

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,240
basically you start getting tired

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,320
at the end of the day that makes your

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,440
work less effective

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,039
but if you are a motivated person and

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,760
you really want to achieve your goals

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
what

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,679
most of the people would do is they try

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,120
to compensate somehow with more working

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,360
time

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,320
but that's a bad decision because i mean

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,880
if you're tired

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,919
you increase the working time what

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,080
happens is

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,960
that tires you even more so what you

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,520
would do is

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,080
you try to compensate but that drives

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,320
you even more and you you would just

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,120
go on with these circles unto the point

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,320
where you could

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,120
just cannot do it anymore and at the end

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,760
of the day you collapse

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,320
so this involvement takes some time it's

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,640
very different from person to person

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,320
but there is some involvement so now you

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
would think okay this

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,320
this involvement should be spottable

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,919
right

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,280
um yes it is portable but

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,159
the problem here is that as an affected

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,559
person

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
it's hard or mostly impossible to spot

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,880
the symptoms

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,280
you on your own you just don't realize

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,840
that something is going wrong

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,679
other people around you they have a good

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,400
chance to spot it

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,159
so this is why communication personal

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
contacts are important

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,840
because then you have to chance that

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,760
other at least could try to tell you

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,840
something is going wrong

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,000
but at the end of the day as an affected

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,159
person

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
i would say you just cannot spot it

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,520
because you're at a point

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:32,320
where you actually lost the ability

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,720
to reflect your own behavior so it's

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,520
always good to have people around you

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,480
communication once again is a key aspect

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,000
you can also put

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,320
measures but we'll come back to that

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
later

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
now

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,919
coming back to the evolvement of

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,120
symptoms so

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:58,559
as mentioned this is a thing that comes

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,320
over time basically

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,919
so you start at some point you just get

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,600
tired

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,840
and then at some point you easily get

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,880
distracted and then you get headaches

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,120
you get often sick

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,720
at some point you lose motivation and at

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,480
some point it's just too much and you

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,480
collapse

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,799
um so this involvement i mean this can

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,480
be very different from weeks or a month

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,120
to years um but once again in fact that

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,919
person

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,080
won't realize that involvement so

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,600
unfortunately most of the people just

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,400
realize it when it's too late when you

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,720
just

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,320
completely collapsed because we just run

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,240
out of energy and you cannot do it

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,919
anymore

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,240
you can also have a different view on

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,240
this

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,480
if you compare it like that you say you

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,240
charge your batteries in your spare time

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,039
how it usually should look like i mean

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,559
you should start the week with 100

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,200
charged batteries um i mean for sure you

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,279
you lose some energy over the week but

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,880
in your spare time over the weekend you

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,400
should be able to recharge your

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,480
batteries you start the next week at 100

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,080
how things usually evolve when you get

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,880
burned out is that the

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,159
your time off is not enough to recharge

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,799
your battery so you just

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,000
do not take really the time of so you do

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,159
not have the chance

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,480
to recharge your battery so you start

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,760
one week at 100 the next week at 80

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,039
percent

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,400
the next week at 70 percent and well

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:32,240
at one point you end up with a collapse

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
because you just cannot do it anymore

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,799
so now what happens here is

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,520
when this collapse comes for an affected

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,000
person

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
i mentioned i mean you do not realize

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,919
these symptoms on your own so for an

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,279
affected person it feels like that

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,840
this collapse comes out of a sudden

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,799
um this is definitely not the case

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,279
because there was

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,039
a long story before where you ran into

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,919
serious trouble and while you got

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,240
really seriously stressed out but i mean

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
it

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,120
just feels like it comes out of the

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,200
sudden it is

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,520
definitely very individual once again

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,559
but usually a feeling of being mentally

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,559
completely

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,400
sucked out and that usually goes along

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,919
usually also with a physical breakdown

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,320
you just

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,960
cannot do anything you're not able to do

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,679
anything

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,039
you not able to do the most simple

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,120
decisions

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,440
so it's very individual but it is

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,480
definitely

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,480
a serious condition

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,320
so now if someone is

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,559
in that condition and is in serious

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,159
trouble so what can we do

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,600
and first of all let me start with the

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,480
perspective of friend

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,760
of a coworker or a team lead so what can

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,840
you do

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,840
to help someone out

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,400
so first of all the only thing you can

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,240
do is you can try to make an effect

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,880
affected person realize the problem

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,559
that sounds way easier than it is

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,480
because the problem is you it's not just

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,760
that you could tell hey man i think you

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
you burned out

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,440
um because the fact that person just

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,559
won't realize

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,640
um so what i can tell is you need a lot

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,919
of patience here

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,880
and this is easily explainable because

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,159
um if you think about how communication

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,399
happens

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,760
it's not just that you say something and

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,520
that makes it

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,679
straight into the brain of another

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,120
person person so i mean another person

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,039
needs to listen and do some

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,520
interpretation the things you are

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,120
saying and also to do some reflection on

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,640
their own behavior

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,559
so now in the case of a person that is

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,399
getting stressed out or burned out

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,679
this interpretation won't work pretty

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,440
well

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,200
which means that the outcome of this

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,760
interpretation

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,600
would not be trustable so this is just

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,600
like we would run a program in a

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,679
piece of memory that is giving

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,200
continuous bit flips so we just cannot

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,799
trust the result

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,559
so even if we tell a person that person

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,559
might not realize that something is

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,159
going wrong

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,000
so the key takeaway here is that if we

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,840
want to help we need to listen and we

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,919
need to be patient

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,159
and we need to understand that because i

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,159
mean that could also make us angry if we

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,080
just want to help someone and we have

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,960
the feeling that this person is not

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,880
even listening to us so i mean that

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,440
person might be listening but

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,200
just won't realize what we try to tell

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,279
and um i mean

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,320
most probably they won't even remember

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,840
afterwards that you

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,440
that you really talked about these

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,480
topics so

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,039
you need patience please do not force

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,360
anything

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,440
that could make things wavers at the end

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,720
of the day

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,200
you need to make people realize

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,279
that something is going wrong and that

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,440
professional help is needed

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,200
at the end of the day this is the only

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,559
thing you could do this is the most

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,640
important thing

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,640
but i mean there's no guarantee that you

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,679
can help and this is also a fact that we

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,840
have to accept

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,760
even with a lot of patience it might not

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,880
be possible to really help if the

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,960
person does not realize

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,279
so what can we do as an affected person

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,320
first of all the most important step is

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,480
to accept

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,960
the situation that sounds easier

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,480
way easier than it is but once again the

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,520
problem is you're in a state of mind

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,279
where you don't

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,039
but you cannot really reflect your own

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,960
behavior

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,480
and i mean you would realize when you

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,399
really collapsed

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,080
and as already mentioned that for you on

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,440
your own that collapse come out of the

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,200
sun

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,960
so you need to think okay what went

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,960
wrong and you need to accept that

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,720
situation

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,080
it is important to understand that

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,440
you're not a loser

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,039
you did not fail at all because you have

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,640
this feeling of fee

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,240
you like a loser but this is not the

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,840
case you're not alone you're suffering a

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,760
serious disease that others have

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,919
suffered before

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,080
this is something you have to accept and

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,840
you need to come to a state where you

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,480
can talk about the situation

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,320
and this is pretty much the basis for

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,360
all the next steps you could

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,200
you could probably take um you need this

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,279
acceptance so for all for the whole

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,880
recovery process this is a continuous

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,480
thing you need to accept the situation

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,480
you need to talk about the situation

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,919
which kind of help is really needed this

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,200
is very

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,799
individual and it needs to be decided by

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,320
a professional that means you should

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,360
talk to a doctor and see

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,360
what is best for you

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,200
well in any case taking really taking

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,399
time off and taking enough time off is

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,399
important

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,600
and if you return to your daily business

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,000
you should do that by

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,360
step by step not going from 100 from 0

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,679
to 100 percent

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,679
just do it step by step and this is

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,600
important because what we also have to

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,919
understand is that

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,760
i mean there are many ways good ways of

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,799
recovery so don't worry

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,960
the way might be long but

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,760
even after the recovery process life

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,960
will be slightly different

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,000
because i mean like any serious disease

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,399
also this disease

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,600
will leave some scars which means

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,840
there's a very high risk

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,039
to fall back to old behavior and bad

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,720
habits

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,880
there's a high risk to run into a

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,320
similar situation again

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,200
and so you need to continuously work on

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,279
your behavior

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,679
this is a fact that you have to be aware

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,200
of if you've been to a burnout situation

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,519
so you continuously

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,320
need to accept the situation and to work

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,320
on the situation

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,600
so now last but not least we've been

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,600
talking a lot now about burnout what are

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,360
the risk factors how it looks like and

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,440
how we can deal with it

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,200
but i think most importantly what we

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,600
also need to understand is what

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,399
can we do to avoid this kind of

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,559
situation

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,720
how what can we do on our own or what

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,919
can we do in the way we work together

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,880
to prevent these situations so now

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,640
starting from the personal perspective

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,720
what can you do so what i can

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,440
recommend you for my personal experience

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,519
is to implement some kind of personal

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,880
alarm system

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,640
which means that the thing is you cannot

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,279
grade your fee your state of health

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,679
just based on your feelings because once

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,679
again

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,360
if you're getting stressed out you won't

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,399
realize that something is going on

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,519
so you need to put some measures so what

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,360
i really recommend is

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,519
think about what is important for you in

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,720
your life what are the most important

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,480
things so for me

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,799
most important thing is to spend time

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,360
with my friends in my family

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,519
and i also want to spend time for doing

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,799
sports so i'm a cyclist i'm into cycling

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,799
so training

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,159
means a lot to me that is really

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,279
relaxing me so i

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,559
really want to do that to relax

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,039
so now um what happens if i

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,159
lose energy or if i do not have enough

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,399
time for sure

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,000
i would skip sports um just to be able

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,399
to spend still enough time with

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,399
friends and family and this is basically

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,360
the step where i realized that things

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,200
are getting risky

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,640
so i need to take counter measures

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,640
because what would happen in the next

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,480
step if i lose even more energy i would

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
also skip time with friends and family

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,519
and then

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,760
i'm already in a very serious situation

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,559
so i would need to take countermeasures

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,480
so

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,919
i really recommend to implement some

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,279
kind of alarm system

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,080
and most importantly also make others

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,080
aware

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,320
of your alarm system so others could

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,640
spot that some things go wrong like for

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,640
me

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,320
if i won't show up for training for

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,320
cycling for a few weeks

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,320
i mean the guys i'm training with they

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,679
would usually realize that something is

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,080
going wrong and they would

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,159
talk to me and ask me why don't you join

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,279
us for the training

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,039
so this alarm system is a pretty simple

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,279
thing i mean for sure it's not a silver

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,480
bullet but it helps a lot to put some

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,480
measure in your daily life

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,639
well there's definitely more you could

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,440
do once again

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,560
take your time off and really take your

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,679
time off

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,679
i mean that means um turn off your phone

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,639
don't read emails just take your time

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,800
off

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,760
do not focus all your passion on your

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,359
job

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,960
this is also something i could tell you

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,960
from personal experience what i

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,560
always try to do is to do something at

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,639
the same or even higher level of passion

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,399
so the same passion i bring into my job

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,679
i want to bring it into something else

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,320
in my spare time

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,639
just to have some yeah counter measures

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,440
in your spare time

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,280
and for sure um i mean whatever you do

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,960
this cannot avoid frustration or

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,800
conflicts this is natural

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,399
in i mean when we work together there

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,679
will be conflicts and there will be

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,839
frustration

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,919
but you should talk about it i mean once

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,399
again communication is a very important

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,320
point

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,839
and we learned that communication that

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,320
is not happening can be a serious

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,800
problem

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,440
so but what can we also do when working

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,720
together

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,599
like what can co-workers do i mean at

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,800
the end of the day

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,720
we should have a culture where we value

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,599
each other where we talk to each other

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,640
where we listen to each other this is

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,839
very important

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,320
and what we can also do as a co-worker

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,320
for sure we can spot changes in behavior

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,160
so if we see that someone is getting

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,680
tired or getting sick on the frequent

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,359
basis or just

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,599
shows changes in his usual behavior

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,760
then we should talk about it i mean for

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,599
sure once again we need patience we need

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,440
the people make realize but we could

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,800
talk to others we could talk also to

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,960
other team members we could

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,240
make the team lead aware so there's a

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,880
lot of things we could do

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,520
if we spot series changes the behavior

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,520
of a person

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,119
so and another important point we also

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,040
should look at the

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,480
like leadership perspective so what

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:06,400
could a team lead or a community lead

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,520
do to avoid that team members get

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,599
are stressed out so

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,720
most importantly and i've mentioned this

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,560
before

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,160
i think it is important to establish an

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,119
open and transparent culture of

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,320
communication

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,240
yes this is a leadership issue you need

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,880
to give people the feeling

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,560
that i mean they can speak up they can

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,920
talk about their problems and you should

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,400
be a good example i mean

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,440
it doesn't help much if you tell people

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,640
talk to each other

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,119
and you do not talk to people that

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,839
does not make any sense at all so it is

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,320
also

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,520
specifically up to the to a team lead to

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,400
a community lead

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:48,400
to establish a good way of communication

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,760
for sure you need make people feel

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,440
valued so

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,200
we've we talked about this also for the

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,640
risk factors if people are not feeling

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,040
valued they they get frustrated

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,720
what we have to learn is for sure um if

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,640
you're needing a project we usually

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,160
talk about the topics that go wrong for

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,280
sure because we need to deliver

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,320
something we get the

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,480
need to get the work done

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,240
so but we need to learn that we also

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,839
explicitly state what went good

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,320
this is important i mean

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,359
we need to address both and at the end

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,680
of the day we need

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,000
to give feedback this is this is very

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,119
important

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,320
positive and negative feedback but

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,440
giving no feedback at all is the worst

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,280
thing you could possibly do because if

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,960
you do not give feedback to a team i

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,480
mean that gives the impression that you

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,520
do not really care about

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,920
about the work that is being done and

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,800
this

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,720
does not make people feel valued so and

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,359
there's a reason why many companies have

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,960
actually

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,800
mandatory trainings in giving and

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,680
receiving feedback so that might sound a

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,599
bit weird but

00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,160
it is very important

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,960
and also you have to give people a big

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,720
picture

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,560
of yeah why their work is needed

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,640
that means make your decisions as

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,880
transparent as possible

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,880
sure but always everything can be

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,880
transparent but make decisions as

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,640
transparent as possible

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,640
tell people why their work is needed and

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,480
why their task is important because

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:26,000
some specific tasks could look

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,960
boring or useless but if you understand

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,119
that this is a

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,400
very important puzzle piece for the big

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,119
picture then

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,880
i mean this gives just the completely

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,560
different motivation to get that work

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,280
done because you know it is important

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,200
and you know why

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,880
it is needed um i think it's also in the

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,160
responsibility

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,520
of of the on the leadership level

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,920
a leadership level that uh you make sure

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,560
that

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
people take enough time off and not just

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,160
taking

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,720
the time so and really taking the time

00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,480
off

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,000
so it's not just once again about the

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,400
amount of time

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,079
it's really about the the quality time

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,160
they are taking off and i mean

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,320
as a team lead you need to make sure

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,000
that your guys take the time off

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,599
and that and i've done this before that

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,680
could include that you just switch off

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,200
their email or their vpn access just to

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,200
make sure they take their vocations

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,240
if there are conflicts within a team we

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,880
need to understand and address it i mean

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,760
conflicts are natural we just need to

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,520
understand it

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:33,200
and if we have continuous conflicts

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,119
we need to understand the root cause

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,560
and i mean for all the things that go

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,359
wrong in a project

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,920
it's i mean it's easy to find a culprit

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,640
and this is usually what happens

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,760
you people just try to find a culprit no

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,760
what you should do

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,359
is go and find the root cause i mean

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,680
it's like um

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,920
the one of the main role of engineering

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,280
is a problem that you do not understand

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,560
will always hit you back

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,880
very badly and this just does not apply

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,720
for

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,320
just technical topics i mean this is

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,000
just the main rule we need to understand

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,160
problems so we can address and we can

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,440
solve it

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,520
also a topic for team leads is

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,520
spot changes in behavior for sure if you

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,160
see that one of your community members

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,400
one of your team members

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,359
shows a different behavior than usual

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,440
talk about it

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,280
try to address it and last but not least

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,880
i know it's a difficult topic but we

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,640
need to give people enough time for

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,040
their task

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,160
for sure if we work on a project if time

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,000
is running out

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,280
we're hitting a deadline and i know we

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,200
all like deadlines

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,319
right specifically that nice whooshing

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,079
sound they make when they pass by

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,760
so we usually get stressed and want to

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,599
get things done but

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,599
what i learned from an old engineer in

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,480
the early days when i just

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,359
finished my studies what he always told

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,760
us is if it's urgent

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,680
take your time and that means for sure

00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,599
that won't change the urgency of the

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,880
topics but just remember

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,400
take your time to think probably

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,240
properly of what you need to get done

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,920
and this is something i mean from a

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,720
leadership perspective you need to make

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,800
sure

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,720
that your team has the proper time and

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,960
the proper environment even

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,960
if things are getting urgent

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,599
okay so um

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,319
this was basically a lot of topics

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,359
related to burnout

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,640
so let's quickly try to summarize um

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,640
what i've been talking about

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,560
what have we learned so at the end of

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,560
the day we have learned that burnout is

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,160
a complex and a very serious topic so

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,040
once again it is

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,200
very individual um it looks different

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,960
from person to person

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,800
but there's a lot of things we can do

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,920
so we have learned that there are

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,480
symptoms that are evolving over time

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,480
but these symptoms are really hard to

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,880
realize or hard to spot for an affected

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,880
person

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,079
so but as a coworker as a team leader as

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,319
a friend we can spot these symptoms and

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,359
we can try to address it

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:20,640
but also remember here that this

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,400
is a continuous effort and it needs

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,680
patience because the affected person

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,640
might not realize

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,040
but we can try to take counter measures

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,040
early

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,520
as an affected person we have

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,040
to accept that the recovery process is a

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,119
continuous effort

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,000
so that means that

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,880
we need to accept the situation and

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,359
continuously accept the situation

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,839
we need to talk about the situation and

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,760
just continuously we need to i mean we

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,280
need to remember that in our daily life

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,920
and once again remember

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,839
we can put measures you can implement

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,920
your personal alarm system

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,240
just to spot early if things go wrong

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,000
again so once again it is a continuous

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,359
effort

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and well if you want to take one key

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,440
message

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,880
from this presentation then

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,520
i mean we need to come back to the

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,119
communication

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,960
i cannot stress that enough good

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,800
communication is

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,720
a key aspect so if we fail with

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,000
communication we will fail with many

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,200
things and that will just

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,119
cause stress and frustration for a team

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,240
and for a community

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,920
so please remember good communication is

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,800
a key aspect for

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,000
avoiding burnout situations it is the

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,920
key aspect for

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,800
dealing with bernard situation and

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,720
it is the key key aspect for recovering

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,760
from bernard situation so

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,040
at the end of the day communication

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,119
is the key

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,640
this is pretty much what i wanted to

00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,560
tell

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,119
once again it's it's important for me to

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,599
raise awareness on this topic

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,440
let me take the opportunity and thank

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,000

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,520
that gave input on this presentation so

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,079
basically this presentation was an

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,160
outcome

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:19,119
of many many conversations

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,160

to each and everyone who helped me out

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,079
and i hope i know it's a very complex

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,880
topic

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,839
it's um not that easy to explain so i

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,480
hope

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,960
it was kind of understandable and for
