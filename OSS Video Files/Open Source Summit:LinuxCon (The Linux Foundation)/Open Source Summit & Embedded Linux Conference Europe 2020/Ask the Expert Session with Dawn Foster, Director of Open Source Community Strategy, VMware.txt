	00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,360
hello everyone

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,679
how are you i am here

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,720
to answer questions i can answer

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,439
questions on

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,880
lots of different things so feel free to

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,480
ask away

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,160
there are a few topics that i'm

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,160
particularly passionate about

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,320
and happy to answer answer questions

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,119
about so things like

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
the chaos project and open source

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,559
project

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,600
health metrics i'm happy to talk about

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,040
governance

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,480
leadership careers in open source

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,239
so it looks like uh my first question is

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,680
about my work on the chaos project and

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,000
how we use open source

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,280
open source project health metrics at

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,039
vmware

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
so this is something that i am

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,960
particularly interested in

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,559
and quite passionate about frankly it's

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,719
something that i enjoy doing

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,280
so my work on the chaos project i'm a

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,000
governing board member and maintainer

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,280
for the project so i help lead one of

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,360
the the working groups

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,840
and i'm involved in a couple of the

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200
other working groups as well so it's a

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,200
it's a great project it's full of

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,920
friendly people so if you like data and

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
metrics

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,200
it's kind of a cool place to get

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
involved it's also

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
one of those projects that you don't

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
necessarily have to contribute code to

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,439
participate to

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
so it's one of those projects that we're

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,600
always looking for people to help us

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,439
define metrics so how do you use them

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,759
what questions are you trying to ask

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,960
what should a metric look like and then

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,880
we also

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,479
then implement it in software so we have

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,799
grimoire lab and

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,799
auger which are two of the software

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,560
tools along with craiget

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,159
that are part of the ks project so we

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,360
have lots of tools

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,759
um that can can help people

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,360
measure their project health so uh in

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,840
the past i've used grammar lab

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,680
a lot i decided at vmware to give auger

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
a try so that's the one that i've been

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,479
using most recently

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,759
what i what i liked about auger is that

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,200
it allows me to do a lot of

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,479
customization

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,920
on the metrics so it basically

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,160
provides me with the back end so it

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
stores all of the data in a database and

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
i can query it

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,480
and do whatever graphs i want to do

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
around it

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,480
some of the things that are important to

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,160
us at vmware i look at for our projects

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,239
i look at things like

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,920
contributor risk are there enough people

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
contributing to the project

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
that if one of them won the lottery and

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
went away tomorrow would

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
it still be um would it still be viable

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,720
and we still be able to maintain it

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
i also look at responsiveness so one of

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,080
the thing one of the guidelines that we

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
give people

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,959
for um

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
for time to response for pull requests

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,720
is two business days

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
so we look at that i look at whether

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
they're closing about as many pull

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,000
requests as they get

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,959
and i also look at release cadence to

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
see if

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,400
we're releasing fixes which to me

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
indicates that we're also you know

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,760
fixing security

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,680
security issues and other things like

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,480
that

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,159
um so there's another question about

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,950
girls in stem

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,959
and chaos um

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,440
[Music]

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,800
so i mean i i do think that it's it's a

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,080
particularly

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,319
interesting um project to contribute to

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,000
for all kinds of different people so i

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,120
certainly think that that

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,680
women who are involved in in stem so

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,239
science technology engineering and math

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,360
um

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,280
are particularly i think would be good

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,560
for the chaos project so i do think it's

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
something that people can get involved

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,519
in

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,519
we also do you know a number of uh like

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,159
google summer code and things like that

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,080
so

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,440
if there are some people that um that

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,840
want to get paid

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,040
to do this we can we can look at that

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
the next time google summer of code

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
comes around so i do think it's a really

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
accessible project for

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,680
for people from various um you know

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,159
underrepresented backgrounds

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
so my presentation this is the other

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,599
question my presentation scheduled for

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
later this week is about collaborative

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,360
leadership and governance why is this

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,760
important for open source projects

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,599
i think that there's there are a lot of

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,320
things that we maybe don't spend as much

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,120
time

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,759
thinking about as as we should for open

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,960
source

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,479
projects so collaborative leadership

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,120
um and and and governance is something

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,560
that

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,840
i certainly think a lot of us don't

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
spend enough time thinking about so you

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
can look at

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,759
i like to i like to frame things in

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,960
terms of risk that's how i frame my

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,680
metrics things are

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,520
higher risk lower risk but it's also how

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
i look at a lot of open source

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,919
projects so i tend to look at things

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,600
like is it under a company

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,120
is the project owned by a company or is

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
it owned by a foundation

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,800
if it's owned by you know a nice neutral

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,000
foundation like cncf the linux

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,720
foundation apache

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,400
software foundation those are those are

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,479
great places to host projects

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,919
and it's probably slightly lower risk

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,160
than it would be if it's

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,280
controlled by a company for example when

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
you are

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,080
basically at the whims of the company

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
and with it being under neutral

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
foundations you can you can get lots of

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,320
people involved you have you know

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,000
contributors can move in from all kinds

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,080
of different companies and you get this

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,080
really sort of diverse

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,759
group of people and i think you can

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
innovate better on projects that way i

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,600
think

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
that's i think that's the reason

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
kubernetes has been so successful was

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,560
because it was donated to cncf where we

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,919
could all

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,080
contribute to it in a way that um

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,840
i think helped it get a lot of traction

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,840
within the ecosystem

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,240
uh let's see what makes a company a good

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,639
open source

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
citizen in open source projects this is

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,080
something we also

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
spend a lot of time thinking about in in

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,479
vmware and we've actually

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,360
our engineering team along with a

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
collaboration

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
from the rest of the open source program

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,840
office has put together a

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,319
really nice list of internal guidelines

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,639
for

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,000
how to be uh how to participate well in

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,240
open source projects and how to be a

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,800
good corporate citizen

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,240
i think there are a few key elements in

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,880
being a good corporate citizen

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,440
in open source projects one of them is

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,400
that you

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,800
you really do have to put the community

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,919
first

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,680
so you've got this open source projects

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,919
have this weird triad so they've got

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,880
individuals who are participating a lot

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
of those individuals

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,800
are employed by companies but they're

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,919
participating in this community so

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,280
you've got this individual

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,560
community company triad and

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,400
it's important for you to think about

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
the the company first or the sorry

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,199
not the company don't think about the

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,919
company first think about the community

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,440
first

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,080
so what is it that the community

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,520
needs and if what you're trying to push

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,520
through because it's what your company

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
needs isn't what the community needs

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
you're just not going to win that battle

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
um you're going to be frustrated and

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,880
it's going to be unpleasant

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
and and you lose employees that way to

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
be honest

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
so i think that really is kind of the

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
key to being a good

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,400
corporate citizen in open source is in

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,160
what you know everything that you do

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,960
really thinking about what the what the

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,960
community needs

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,360
um what do you love about working in

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,560
open source

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,479
so i love this question uh because it's

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,080
you know it's sort of funny like i i

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,759
grew up on a farm in

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,759
ohio and everybody i knew

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,360
worked in factories and on farms that

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,919
was that was my whole world view

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
uh to be honest growing up and i sort of

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,800
ended up

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,560
looking into being able to to go to

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,919
university and get a computer science

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
degree

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,199
and you know my first job out of out of

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,319
college was

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,319
as a cis admin for uh was unix at the

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,479
time it was in the 1990s

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,599
and and this sort of launched this whole

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,759
career for me

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,000
and because i was a cis admin i used a

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,960
lot of open source projects

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,080
and then when i went to intel a few few

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,919
years later

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,599
they got me involved in a whole bunch of

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,000
of open source work

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,960
and what i found fascinating was that

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
you know these

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,720
these communities work really well

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,720
there's all this kind of there's all the

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,039
structure behind it that maybe you've

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,479
not not noticed if you're not involved

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,039
in the community

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,240
but by being involved in these

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,919
communities

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,120
i have met people all over the world

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,759
i you know if you had told 15 year old

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
dawn foster that um i was going to get

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,879
to travel the world

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,800
and go to lots of conferences and all

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,880
kinds of really exciting places and give

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,680
presentations about technology to other

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
people

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,640
i would have been like you're crazy that

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,240
is not a job people don't pay people to

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
do stuff like that that's you know

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,800
that's

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,959
that's fun that's not really not really

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,040
something you get paid for

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,120
but the people i've met are super

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,440
interesting and i can

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,880
realistically i can go a lot of places

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,040
around the world

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,720
and and i know people from these open

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,600
source projects that i've worked in and

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,360
i can

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,120
get together with them for for coffee or

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,360
for a drink or lunch or something

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
and it's it's really really kind of cool

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
because these are interesting people to

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
talk to

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,399
they're you know they're fun to be

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,480
around and so it's just this

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,839
the people that i've met has just been

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,959
been fantastic and that

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
fantastic and that really really is what

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
makes the

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,640
what makes the community

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,560
um can you talk about the uh

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,399
balancing the needs of the individual

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,680
the company and the community within

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,120
open source projects

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,959
i kind of talked a little bit about that

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,560
because that is that is sort of the

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,160
the triad that i was talking about

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,279
earlier but you know as

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,560
an individual your your company

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,279
has things that you want them to do um

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,399
the community has things that make sense

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,880
for them

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,880
and you as an individual have to end up

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
balancing these two things so how do i

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
get things done that

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
are things that you know the company is

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,279
going to pay me to continue to do this

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,959
really awesome open source job

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,399
but how do i do those in a way that it's

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
something that the community actually

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,640
needs and wants and is going to be

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,200
is going to be interesting and so being

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,240
able to um to balance that

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,640
is is hard but it's one of the things

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
that

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,880
will make you successful as an employee

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,240
in open source

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,240
um so christian patterson asks what role

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
the foundation or project charter

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
in fostering community or making a

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,279
breaking community

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,600
um so i do think that the

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,959
project documentation the what i would

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,760
broadly call governance

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,279
um so things like project charter

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,279
decision making documentation

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,440
things like that i do think that that

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
can make or break the community so if i

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
look at a governance

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,760
a governance dock or a foundation that

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,600
maybe isn't

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,800
it isn't very neutral it's completely

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,800
controlled by a company

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,880
or almost entirely controlled by a

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,920
company and it's not clear

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,880
how i as an employee of some other

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,440
company or

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,240
as an individual who's not employed by a

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,320
company

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,399
how can i participate and be effective

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,000
and if i like it how do i move into a

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,920
leadership position

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,680
and if that's not clear i think a lot of

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,079
people just don't tend to participate in

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,040
those

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,160
those types of projects because if you

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,839
know if it's something that you really

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,279
love to do and you start to get engaged

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,600
and it's just not clear that

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,040
it becomes clear that you will never

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,320
really get to do any real work in that

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
project because you don't work for the

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,160
right company

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,959
i think is very um disheartening to a

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,800
lot of people

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,959
and i do think that that can definitely

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,320
kind of make or break the community

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,680
um the other things that i think are

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
important things like you know code of

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,560
conduct

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
good contribution docs so that people

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,560
know how to contribute

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
um

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
yeah and like you know contributorship

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,000
there's so much that you can do that i

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,920
you know

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
broadly kind of falls under governance

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,760
that really can help

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
uh make the the community great

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,760
um denise hello denise

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
um so denise asks uh you went back to

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,720
school recently

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,079
how has that new degree enhanced your

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,839
boss journey

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,320
um yeah so i i spent 20 years in tech

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,680
i for my midlife crisis decided that i

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
was going to quit my job

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,839
move to london and get a phd and i was

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,040
going to study collaboration within the

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,240
linux kernel

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,320
as my um as my project for my phd

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,279
which was which was loads of fun it got

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,639
me

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,399
back involved in things that were more

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,000
technical again so this is one of those

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,600
things you move up within company

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,279
you start managing more people and then

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
you're managing more people

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
and then you sort of work yourself out

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,279
of getting to do anything technical

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,680
again

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,680
so what this gave me an opportunity to

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,399
do was play around with the

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,880
grimar labs tools all huge data sets i

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,959
wrote piles and piles of python code

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
um i also wrote piles of piles of r

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,320
which was really kind of uh

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,000
terrible and horrible um

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,279
but but it was you know honestly it was

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,399
it was a lot of fun because i got to

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,600
play with data i get to learn

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,399
interesting things

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,120
and and i really did i really didn't

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,440
enjoy that

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,800
you know and then going back getting you

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
know going back into the

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,399
the tech industry which was always my

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,440
plan from the very beginning

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,120
um i you know i've been able to do a

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,720
little bit more of the the metrics i've

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
been able to kind of work it into my

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,279
jobs uh

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,519
since then which has been which has been

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,160
pretty cool

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,440
uh christian asks what kind of metrics

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,959
do you like to look at when

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,760
evaluating community contribution um

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,279
yeah so when i look at the vmware open

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
source projects there are there are

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,600
really

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,959
four things that i look at so i look at

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
i look at contributor risk

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,240
are there enough people contributing

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,560
that if one of them left that we'd be

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,199
able to sustain the community

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,600
um in the project i look at whether

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,440
we're merging prs in a timely fashion or

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,639
we're sorry responding to vrs in a

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,480
timely fashion

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,320
i'll look at whether we're closing about

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,560
as many pr's as we open

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,399
so not not necessarily merging them but

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,320
closing them so even the ones that we

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,959
aren't going to merge get closed in a

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
timely

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,000
fashion and then i also look at releases

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,680
which i use as an indicator that we're

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,680
we're fixing bugs we're applying

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,120
security patches and then we're

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,320
you know pushing a release so that

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
people can then easily easily get those

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,440
so those are some of the things that

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,560
that i look at and then we also look at

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
things like you know this project have

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,760
code of conduct are the good

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,680
contribution talks there's there's loads

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,120
of stuff that i look at when

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,320
evaluating community contribution

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,800
um dirk i feel like this is a

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,399
loaded question from the boss how about

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,399
source communities changed in the last

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,000
two decades that you've been involved

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,399
um so i have indeed been involved in

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,880
open source for a very long time

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,079
um i think a lot has changed in open

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,120
source communities

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,800
uh over those those two decades so you

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
know originally most of the communities

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,639
looked like the linux kernel it was a

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,440
mailing list you sent patch diffs

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,160
um and most of the interaction happened

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,600
there

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,519
i think the tools have evolved

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,959
significantly so i think with the

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,240
introduction of github

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,079
and it becoming so incredibly prolific

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
within the industry

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,920
that's that's really changed the entire

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,360
model for how we

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,600
how we engage with people and how we

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,600
collaborate on on projects

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,279
and so i think that the tools have

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,040
changed significantly

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,279
i also think that there is a

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,000
concerted effort to make these

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,079
communities much less

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,480
let's just say to make them much more

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,519
accessible to people and

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,279
a fun place to participate so you know

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,720
20 years ago a lot of the open source

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,040
communities were super

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,160
toxic um especially to to new

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
contributors

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,240
and there you know there wasn't always

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,920
uh you know much of a push to get a lot

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
of people involved

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,759
and and when you did try to get involved

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,279
you you know people didn't treat you

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,560
very well if you were if you were new

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
and you made a little mistake or you

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,040
didn't know what you were doing

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,480
um and so that i think i think was

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,519
really hard to get engaged in open

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,079
source projects

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,000
contrast that with kubernetes which has

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,519
a really clear contributor ladder so

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
this is what you do to get engaged in

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,680
the project and move up within it

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,519
here are the mentorship programs that we

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,079
offer you here's the new contributor

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,160
workshop

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,360
that you can go to to learn how to be a

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,000
new contributor

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,839
here are the piles and piles of amazing

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,759
contribution docs that you can read if

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,199
you have questions about

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,800
you know any part of the the

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,560
contribution process

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,639
and here's the contributor experience

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,920
sig where you can go and

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,920
and you can ask questions and you can

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,959
learn more and you can um you can really

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,000
get involved

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,639
so i really do think that um that that's

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,399
been the other

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,399
like that just the kind of culture of

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,639
these projects and being more welcoming

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,160
and i still think we have a long way to

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,160
go when it comes to diversity and

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,920
inclusion and open source projects

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,199
but i do um you know i am optimistic

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,480
about the progress that we've made so

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,759
far so i do think we're

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,320
you know moving in the right direction

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,079
it just takes some time

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,880
um so cassandra asks what are some

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,279
successes

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
that you can share some lessons learned

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
that could be applied to someone's

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,959
someone's own project wow i don't know

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,439
where to start with this one one of the

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,679
things

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,600
um one of the things that i would say is

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,079
that every open source project

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,600
is different so that's actually one of

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,799
the things that makes this an amazing

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,839
job that i could do for

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,439
20 plus years is that um every community

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,640
that i work in is a little bit

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,319
different but what that means is that i

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
do think you need to be careful

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,480
not to compare your project with other

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,679
projects that are very different from

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,880
yours because it's easy to get

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
discouraged you know

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,160
my project doesn't have this this other

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,120
project has this so you know

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,240
be careful about comparing the projects

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,679
too much

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,600
but one of the things i would encourage

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,080
you to do is learn from other projects

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,160
and see

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,440
how you can apply some of the changes

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,520
or some of the things that another

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,559
project is doing back into

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,240
your project so uh yeah i mentioned the

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,919
kubernetes community before

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,200
it's always the example that i give

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,320
people when they're looking to grow

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
community

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,200
and because it really they really have

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,880
loads of documentation and mentorship

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,200
programs and

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
um shadow programs we can shadow

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
somebody for

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,039
for a role and then maybe eventually

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,039
take over that role

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,559
uh so they they have all kinds of good

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,960
things i'd say learn

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,679
learn as much as you can from from other

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,160
other projects

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,160
uh rob asks did you ever encounter a

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,039
community that drastically changed an

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,799
atmosphere

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,039
and culture um that's a good

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,320
question i would say that none of the

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,200
projects that i've been

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,600
directly involved with have maybe

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,760
drastically changed in in culture during

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,919
the times that i was involved with them

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,960
i would say that i do think that the

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,080
linux kernel

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
has changed quite a lot um when it comes

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
to

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,240
when it comes to culture from you know

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,039
looking at it 20 years ago to looking at

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,480
it now

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,640
you know i certainly think there's you

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,960
know still progress to be made but you

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
know they have a code of conduct

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,080
they're involved in the outreachy

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,559
program where they get

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,280
you know lots of really great interns

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,520
who do

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,360
cool work from underrepresented

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,360
backgrounds

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,679
um so i do think the you know the linux

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,480
kernel is is certainly is certainly

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,840
getting there

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,840
um i think the biggest one of the

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,919
biggest challenges that they have is

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,679
is kind of the the tools that they use

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,039
so it's not particularly accessible to

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,640
people who

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,160
aren't intimately familiar with how how

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,679
mail english should work for open source

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,919
projects which makes it um

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
a little bit a little bit harder i think

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,400
for for new people to

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,400
to engage in in those projects um

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,000
yeah i think that's probably probably

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,799
the example

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,559
that i would that i would use and i

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,039
think we're

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,080
are we out of time i think this session

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,240
ends at

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,640
25 past which is which is right now

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,840
so i guess i guess the session's over so

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,320
thank you all so much

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,840
for coming come to my talk tomorrow i'm

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,200
going to talk about

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
a lot of the stuff that i talked about

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,400
here it's kind of focused on leadership

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,280
and governance but i will touch on some

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:10,480
of the other things

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,480
