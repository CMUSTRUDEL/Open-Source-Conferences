	00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,920
welcome everyone

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,919
so as this is a birds of a feather

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,519
session

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,679
feel free to open up your camera

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,799
um open up your microphone if you want

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,400
to chime in

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:23,039
it's really an informal

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,920
session so i'm here only to facilitate

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,519
make sure that we're all adhering to the

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720
code of conduct

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,760
but this is a session for you as much as

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,880
for everyone so feel free to take

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,120
part i prepared a few things

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,120
to kick off the conversation

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,680
but if you have ever been to a

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,399
bird's-eye feather really it's

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,399
free for all

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
because we are at the official starting

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,320
time

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,960
i'm just going to let you know what i

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,960
prepared

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
i have a couple slides about the

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,439
challenges that we are facing

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,960
with metrics about open source

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,560
projects open source communities

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,960
i have a few things about how the chaos

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,880
project is addressing these challenges

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
and what we can learn from the chaos

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,119
project

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,439
and then i have a section for open

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,240
conversations and to talk about lessons

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,320
learned

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,159
the lessons that we learned through the

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,640
chaos project

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,360
that i learned through my phd

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,680
researching

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,720
open source community health

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,119
but also your experiences so this is

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,079
why we are in an open zoom call where we

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,600
can all

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:54,000
chime in and talk and share what we have

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:58,240
to share a little background to

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,280
me for those who might not know me yet

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,079
i'm georg link i'm originally from

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,200
germany

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,759
so it was very great very good to see

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
that

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,760
we have some from germany

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,000
dialing in today and i work at pytergia

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,360
a company that provides metrics

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,760
analytics about

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,640
open source projects about software

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,000
development projects

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,959
and i came to biterger because i was

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,319
very involved in the chaos project

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,040
and chaos is short for community health

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,920
analytics

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,519
open source software where we want to

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,560
understand the health of open source

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,400
communities

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,400
and build a network of people who are

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
interested in this topic and how do we

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
use metrics to understand community

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,720
health

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,040
so metrics around open source

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,360
communities and the health of projects

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
is something that i've been working with

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,760
for quite a while

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,159
so thank you for joining the session

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,159
today

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:09,120
when we talk about metrics

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,720
the it is on the one hand we're talking

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
about the method

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
of measuring something and on the other

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,519
hand we're talking about

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,720
the outcome the results that we get

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,959
and so when we look at open source

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,560
communities they have project data

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,640
a lot of this data is you know

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
automatically generated just because we

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,480
are working in the open we're developing

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,280
in the open

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,720
all of those interactions produce

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,920
footsteps

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,959
or trace data that we can

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,400
analyze the git log the mailing list

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,720
archive

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,720
the chat history on irc

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,599
so those are the trace data which we

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
need some way of

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,040
getting insights from and that's where

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
the method comes in

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,080
we can also produce our own data if you

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,280
wanted

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,760
more qualitative data we can run surveys

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,799
or interviews or sometimes

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,120
we don't have the data that we want and

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,799
so we have to figure out how to get it

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
but then we have the method so once we

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,840
have the data we have the method to get

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,160
the insights

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,080
and in my analogy here we're going from

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,840
a cloudy day to a sunny day

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,440
where we the clouds clear up and we can

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,320
see

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,800
so that's when i think of metrics really

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
what

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
what we're talking about what i'm

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,840
talking about

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,600
and i'm going to pause throughout this

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
session because it's a personal feather

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,880
session

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
you're all welcome to chime in if you

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,040
want to

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:54,320
open your microphone and add something

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,560
feel free to do so at any time

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,840
you can also raise your hand or write in

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,120
the chat if you want to add something

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,160
i'll have an eye on that and

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,160
make time for you

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,320
so if you want to understand how our

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,080
open source communities are doing how

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,120
the project is developing

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,960
evolving there are several challenges

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,960
that we all are facing

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,000
and those challenges i group them in

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,120
legal and ethical challenges

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,840
organizational challenges and technology

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
challenges

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,840
when we talk about the legal and ethical

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,880
challenges

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,639
this is where we think about laws like

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,880
the european general data

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,880
protection regulation gdpr

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,360
where the european union has given

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:58,400
all eu citizens autonomy over their data

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,639
which the question

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,479
often is in open source if someone

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,560
participates in open source project

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,160
and they're giving away their data

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
and they know it will be publicly

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,479
visible are there any concerns with

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,560
analyzing that data and would you become

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,039
a data controller by the gdpr law

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
which says that if you analyze the data

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
then

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,319
you need to let the data subjects our

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,120
open source community members who are

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,120
who whose names or email address or

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
contributions we're analyzing

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,680
you have to let them know they need to

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,680
be able to opt out

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,720
we also have data privacy issues

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,240
or questions is it fair to expose

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,360
someone

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
how do we do this are we

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,120
letting everyone know that they can opt

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,240
into the analysis

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,680
or do we go the opposite way and we say

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,520
hey

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,919
analyzing the open source community in

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
project is good for the community we do

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,120
this

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,360
and it's expected by the members that

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,599
this is something we would be doing but

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,759
we still given way for someone to opt

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:16,960
out

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:20,000
so those are legal ethical challenges

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,400
and i'm gonna pause here

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
for a second to see if anyone wants to

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,759
chime in

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,080
again this is a birds of feather session

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,000
thank you for everyone who is here

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:36,400
if you joined late also welcome

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,680
the as a birds of feather session

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
we are all welcome to talk and have a

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,440
dialogue

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,120
that's why we are in zoom today and not

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,120
in the main conference platform

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,879
so in the chaos project where we develop

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,039
metrics for for you to choose from

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,879
to if you want to analyze open source

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,680
projects

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,440
we recognize that these legal and

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
ethical challenges

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
we can give some opinions on them but we

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,039
cannot solve it specifically

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,080
for you because it depends on

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,360
what data you're analyzing depends on

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,080
who's in the community what where you're

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
located

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,919
so there are different laws that we need

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,840
to

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,840
pay attention to

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,440
moving on to organizational challenges

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
when you start analyzing open source

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,560
projects

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,959
and you find a good tool that does that

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,160
which i have some recommendations later

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:50,080
then it's often like opening a fire hose

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,160
a fire hose of data and unless you have

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
a specific question you're trying to

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,800
answer or strategy for how

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,320
to analyze the data and derive meaning

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,760
from it

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,640
you'll be overwhelmed and

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,000
so a challenge is what is our strategy

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,320
what do we actually want to do

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,600
with the open source project with the

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,720
community

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,600
and how can we use the metrics

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,880
to make meaningful decisions to check

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,880
whether we are on track

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,839
and get actionable insights

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,279
if we start having data

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,000
and metrics about open source

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,000
communities

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,600
our communities are often very

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,720
opinionated themselves

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,880
and they want to be in charge

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,000
or they want to be asked before we

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,959
do something so giving

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,560
information to the community before

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,600
creating a dashboard

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,720
a community dashboard or something is a

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,720
generally good idea

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:10,240
we also have technical technological

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,440
challenges um and again i

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,200
feel free to jump in at any time if you

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,000
want to add something if

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,480
you have an idea and you have an example

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,680
that you want to bring in

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
please do just you can

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,720
let me know that you want to speak or

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,760
you can just unmute yourself and

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,839
let me know as well so technical

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:39,040
technological challenges well one

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,680
is we have to actually get the data

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,760
the data in open source project is as

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
diverse as the different tools that we

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,240
use

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,720
we have mailing lists we have a

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,399
repository on github or gitlab or we

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
host it ourselves we have an issue

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,640
tracker

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,920
a forum of wiki an

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,760
instant messaging service

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,160
open source communities are all very

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,079
diverse no two communities

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,279
look alike and even if we say we all use

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,040
a mailing list

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,120
which there are many communities that

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,600
don't do that anymore but even if we say

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,160
we have

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,000
mailing lists there are different

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,760
different versions different

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,880
providers and so getting the quality

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
data

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,480
is something that we all need to get

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,079
through because we need to collect

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
the data that we're interested in

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,160
we have some solutions for that in the

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,760
case project again i'll

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,440
talk about the tools here in a little

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,720
bit

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,959
another challenge is managing identities

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
so one reason we might be interested in

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,560
having data about

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,519
our communities is because we want to

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,320
give

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,279
active contributors a vote at the

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
upcoming

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,680
board elections or you know it's

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,080
something that i've seen

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
and being able to say hey this person

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,240
[Music]

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,560
xyz is the same person as y zx

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
is really helpful just because they use

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,240
work email and

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,760
personal email or because they have a

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,880
different username on

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,480
github than they have on twitter being

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,880
able to say hey this is actually the

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,399
same person it's really valuable

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,399
because then you can see the whole

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,200
picture of what they are contributing

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,519
to our open source community

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,959
and then it's not just about collecting

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,000
quality data

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,360
always keeping up with api changes

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,680
and managing the quality of

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,680
data we have but our contributors the

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,880
identities merging

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,360
but we also need to have a way of

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,240
reporting on that data and visualizing

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,959
that

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,440
having dashboards running regular

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,240
reports

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,519
so maybe we have people that we need to

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,200
report to

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,040
maybe we have managers that care about

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,040
hey how is our community doing

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
so being able to take the raw data and

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,839
make it

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
into something meaningful

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,120
now there are some super experts

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,519
that just look at open source

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,600
communities and they

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,560
they can tell you hey it's going really

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,120
well

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,680
here are the things that you can improve

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,880
but

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,160
for the most part if if you're normal

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
like me

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,000
then it's really hard to do that and

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,800
this is where

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,240
together we can be better stronger

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,079
faster

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,880
and this is the second part where

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,360
i have some things to share about the

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,760
chaos community

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,360
and again if there's a birds of feather

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,680
i saw

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,920
new people join in you're welcome to

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,000
speak up if you have something to share

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,880
this is a very

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,639
very open format i just have some slides

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,839
too

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,760
share some thoughts that i've had

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,079
and unlike being in a room where i can

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
stare at you and ask you hey do you have

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,240
something to add

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
i'm really inviting you to to speak up

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,680
there's a

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,839
session for all of us so if you have any

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,839
questions or thoughts or examples

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,199
let me know so

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,800
together better stronger faster

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:38,000
this is what we're doing with the chaos

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,560
community and so going through these

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
let's say

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,560
together is the chaos community we've

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,920
started

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,120
at about three years ago

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,920
um at the linux foundation the there's a

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,160
metrics

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,600
community that is older but we've

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
started at the lynx foundation three

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,440
years ago

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,160
with the goal of bringing together

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,720
industry

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,399
academics i was earning my phd at the

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,839
time

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,920
tool makers like peturgia where i work

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,600
now

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,079
the practitioners open source

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,320
foundations community members like

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,959
yourself

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,399
and we want to understand okay what is

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,480
community health and

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,680
how do we understand that through

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,880
metrics

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:30,000
building out tools that we can use

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,040
so that's what we set out to do

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,680
and now we're becoming better we are

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,880
developing

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,000
chaos practices we're talking about

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,199
how do we actually analyze

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,040
communities how do we use the metrics to

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,519
scale up the work we do

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,959
how do we reduce bias in our decision

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,279
making

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,120
how do we manage our communities our

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,360
engagement with these communities

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,800
through the data that we are collecting

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,680
how do we support

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,680
decision making

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,639
these are all things that we are talking

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,680
about in the chaos community

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,480
and having this community of practice is

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,199
really

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,399
helpful and we produce blog posts we

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,519
produce

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,320
all kinds of things to share this

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,880
one thing that we are producing or

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,880
creating

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,079
in the chaos community are metrics

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,880
and this is where we become stronger

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,959
because we are starting to have a

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,040
unified language

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,120
about how we are measuring our open

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,160
source communities and projects

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,279
we are becoming stronger because we can

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,920
use the metrics that others have already

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,240
vetted

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,079
and said hey this is how you collect the

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,000
data this how you analyze it

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,079
here are some thoughts on what this

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,519
means

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,800
in chaos if you go to chaos.community

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:03,440
metrics we have a list of

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,160
almost 50 metrics now and every year

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
we keep adding more and the way we have

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,520
organized the

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,360
work in the chaos community is in

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,360
working groups

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,120
because different people care about

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,760
different things and measuring different

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,199
things

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,360
we have working groups one is on

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,799
diversity and inclusion

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,640
one working group is on risk one

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,799
working group is on evolution you see

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,440
the trend here value

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,679
and common are other working groups and

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,200
each one of them is defining

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,880
metrics that they care about so

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,480
code changes here the example i have on

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,320
the screen is

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:46,160
in the evolution working group

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,520
and code changes is our word for commit

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:54,160
we just chose a more neutral term

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:57,120
code changes um

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,440
so there's a buffet of metrics that you

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,880
can choose from

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,760
if you want we can do a deep dive into

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
the metrics i'm just listing this here

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,080
as an option of thing

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,080
something we can talk about

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:19,440
we also have going to faster so

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,760
together better stronger faster if you

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,600
want to start

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,520
analyzing an open source community or

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,520
project

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,120
we have some software that you can start

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,840
using

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,200
and the software already solves many of

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,360
the technical challenges we talked about

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,640
we collect data from many different data

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,039
sources we can

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,280
present that data we can manage

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,760
identities

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,520
the grimola project which you see here

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,840
at the top right

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,720
is being used by big fortune 500

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,200
companies

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,000
to understand their open source

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,000
engagements

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,360
and projects agar is something

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,240
is a tool that is developed by the

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,679
university

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,160
of missouri as a

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,679
playground where we try out new metrics

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,280
and

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,880
some of you on this call might have

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,160
already played with this as well

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,039
and found it to be useful to

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,320
run queries against the data so gremolab

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,720
and auger are the two

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,919
big tools that we have in chaos that you

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,640
can just

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,799
start collecting data with but they're

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,600
very different philosophies

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,400
so something we can also talk about if

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,400
you're interested

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:44,559
the g with the looking glass that's uh

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,480
short for oh that's the tool cricket

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:52,320
and it's used for the kernel report

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,200
and to understand basically like get

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,240
blame who made changes to the source

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,039
code

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,360
but not at the line level with get blame

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,520
you only see who edited the line

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,120
with cricket you actually can see who

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,039
added this variable

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:12,240
or who last edited this function name

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,200
which might be helpful to know who you

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,200
can ask about it

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,480
so in the chaos community we can

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,559
together get better stronger faster

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,080
in having metrics and analytics and

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
understanding open source

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,039
communities

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,400
now is the part where i would really

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,760
like to hear

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,080
from you all about what have you done

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,280
with

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,120
metrics so far what you have you learned

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,559
um i have a few more slides to

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,360
spark ideas or thoughts but if you have

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,799
something

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,559
you want to share with others or if you

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,360
have questions hey there's an open

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,640
format

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,840
maybe there's someone on the call who

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
has some ideas for you

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,400
maybe this is when speaking um one

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,000
thing i was wondering when i hear about

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,919
community health is a common

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
understanding at least within chaos

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,840
what a healthy project at least is i

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,280
mean some projects maybe it might be

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,280
healthy if they

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
change over time some projects might be

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,840
healthy if they don't change at all

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,840
to take this metric for example

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,360
and that is something we are talking

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,240
about

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,039
in the community as well that some

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,159
projects are

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,960
growing some are it's very stable and

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,840
some are

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,840
even declining as you said very stable

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
the definition that i like the most is

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,960
to say

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,360
a community has the potential

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,159
to continue developing quality software

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,799
because you're putting the focus on

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,360
quality

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,080
software the output but you're also

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,240
putting

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,039
focus on the community that it can

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,039
establish that

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,240
and that that's the definition that i

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,840
like the most

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,840
that i'm using in my own work

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,919
does that resonate with you swim

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,000
in a way i mean this is really pretty

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,440
result so

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,280
i mean when looking at your work you

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,919
could also think about other parameters

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,919
like

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,840
who are the people who are involved it's

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,840
maybe also interesting aspect but

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,080
i like the aspect that it's just for the

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,520
result

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,440
i mean this game comes with the question

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,039
what is actually quality software it

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,480
might have also some

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,480
different layers and dimensions but

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,799
absolutely and i don't have to be the

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,080
only one who is answering here

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,880
so if anyone wants to chime in reply to

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,760
sven's question how do you define

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,760
community health

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,640
and some communities are not producing

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,760
software

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,600
i know there are many open source

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,880
communities that are not producing

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,760
software

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,720
so there the output might be something

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,919
different

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,000
and or you really just have a community

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,799
that is getting together and so the

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,880
focus of your definition should be

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,919
on other people getting out of the

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,200
community what

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,200
they want to get out of it

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,280
and is it a good experience to be part

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,280
of the community

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:51,360
so bryce asked the question in the chat

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:55,520
how is improper data identified

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,679
and managed and bryce could you

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,919
clarify for us what do you mean by

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:05,840
improper data and do you maybe have an

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:09,200
example in mind

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:13,840
now i don't maybe bryce

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:18,400
if you could add that in the chat

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:33,840
or speak up

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:33,840
you're muted right now

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,840
okay so bryce said i apologize

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,480
i have to say i'm rather ignorant but i

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,600
imagine

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,320
someone with not the best of intentions

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,320
might have access and alter

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:06,400
so what the thoughts that come to mind

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,080
listening to or reading your question

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,200
is when we have open source

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:17,520
communities the data

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:22,159
is often public to begin with

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:25,279
and there are some shady characters

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:29,760
who do analyze the

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:32,240
data on extracted form

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,400
one example is get everyone's email

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,880
address and start direct marketing

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:42,880
to the developers in the project

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:46,400
and that is something that is improper

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
it's unethical

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,120
but i don't know if you're talking about

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,120
that kind of analysis

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,840
or that kind of data use

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,120
so if you have something else to add

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:11,840
please

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,840
add it to the chat

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,720
i'm oh no worries bryce i appreciate

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,760
that you

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,880
asked the question i'm just

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:27,360
trying to figure out

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:31,440
you know how best to answer that

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,919
um and maybe i'm just not quite

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,960
understanding either

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,360
one thing that i i was

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,640
that we talk about in the chaos

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,480
community is that

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,760
we have different reasons for having

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,320
metrics

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,919
and different points in time when we

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,039
want to understand what is happening in

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,120
our communities in our projects

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,279
so here on the left you see a dashboard

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,360
when you're driving a car

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,360
you just want to see it how fast am i

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,600
going and do i need to

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,559
you know apply the brake or the gas to

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,600
get up or down to the speed limit

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,679
do i need to fill up the tank again how

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,480
am i doing on gas

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,600
so there are some things you need on a

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,000
day-to-day

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,320
operations basis as you're working in

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,960
open source communities or projects

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,880
then you just a quick plants easy to

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,919
understand metric

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,120
but sometimes your car breaks down you

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,399
have smoke coming out

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,240
you know everything stalls you pull over

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,320
or you just have a regular maintenance

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,799
check once per year

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,840
and you go to a mechanic who has the

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,159
vehicle inspection

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,279
report that he fills out and there are

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,440
many different metrics

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,480
how are the brakes doing how is the um

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,159
the shocks how the tires

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,840
and so taking a deeper look at the car

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,200
and we can do the same thing for our

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,399
open open source

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,720
projects and communities where

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,640
we can look at the data on a day

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,679
day-to-day or week-to-week basis how are

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,360
we doing

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,600
are we growing um is there anything

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,720
that we should be paying attention to

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,360
but then

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
occasionally we do some stepping back

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
and

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,520
thinking about hey what's our overall

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,159
strategy

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,919
are we engaging the people that we want

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,440
to engage

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,559
um is there any bottlenecks

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,840
that we should be focusing on and that's

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,840
when reports come in

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,080
so again i'm opening this up do you have

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,360
any

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,279
experience with dashboard metrics or

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,880
report metrics

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,480
um i don't want to call on in one

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,520
specific i'm just opening up

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:59,840
the floor if you have something you

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:59,840
would like to add here

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,080
so another thing that

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,559
we hear or i hear a lot in the chaos

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,039
community

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:21,840
is that people would like a baseline

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,320
being able to say hey we're doing better

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,919
than

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,799
last year and for that we actually need

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:32,080
to know how no how did we do last year

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:35,440
so we need to start collecting

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,039
data early and have it ready for

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,320
when we do want to use it

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,440
so part of it is to listen and

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,200
when you start the metric journey

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
just start collecting everything that

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,640
you can you don't know what you will use

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,440
in the end

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,320
but at least you have it now this is to

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,399
start

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,320
you cannot always look at all the data

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,520
that's where strategy comes in

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,520
which i'll talk about next

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,440
but you you want to have that baseline

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,279
or sometimes you're not

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,880
using your own history as the baseline

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,720
sometimes you want to compare yourself

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,919
to other projects like here in the

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,039
screenshot

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,960
i compared the two chaos projects auger

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:20,559
and grimola

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,640
and i was very surprised to see that

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,760
they evolve about the same even though

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,559
they have completely different

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,039
development

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,320
teams and there's very little overlap in

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,919
the

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,799
contributors and

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,520
what i what i think well i don't

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,760
actually know

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,399
what is happening but i i know that

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,679
during google summer of code

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:47,440
there's a lot more outside contributions

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,880
or from outside the community

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,080
so i think that those are the spikes

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,080
or some of the spikes

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,720
if you want to start getting uh

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,200
visualizations like this

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:07,600
i can recommend check out cauldron.io

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,320
it's a service that builds on top of the

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,640
chaos grimoire lab technology but you

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,519
can just go to golden io

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,440
put in the repositories github

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,960
repositories or gitlab repositories that

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,360
you want to analyze

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,919
and you get information and you can

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,640
compare projects you can

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,480
get metrics on multiple repositories

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,840
combine them into one

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,840
project a really useful tool

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,760
so collect everything

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,440
start listening to your community have

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,720
the metrics ready for when you do want

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,240
to use the analysis

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,240
and also some metrics you can go back

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,600
in history like the git log you have the

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,919
full history

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,679
that you can analyze other metrics if

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,600
you're interested in

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,720
how your number of stars on github

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,000
evolves

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,880
there you have a two week

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,640
time window to collect the data through

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,519
the github api

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,080
and so you cannot get the history of

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,120
that

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,720
beyond or further back

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,279
through the api so you want to start

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,200
collecting that to build up your

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,200
graph your history

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:36,159
again i'm opening this up

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,159
is there any thoughts comments

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:45,440
concerns questions

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,120
so in addition to collecting all the

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,799
data we actually need to know what we're

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,279
looking for we need to know what

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,760
the needle is we're looking for in the

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,159
haystack

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,840
and in the chaos project we are

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,720
proposing or

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,720
advocating for using the goal question

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,919
metric approach

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,880
so you start with your goals what do you

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,000
actually want to do

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,480
let's say we want to grow contributors

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,480
then we have some questions for how we

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,960
doing

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,559
how many new contributors did we have

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,799
last month

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,279
how many active contributors do we have

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,159
right now

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,960
and once we have those questions we can

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,080
figure out what

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,440
data can answer those questions

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,039
so if you want to grow the contributors

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,960
our goal you want to know how many

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,320
question how many new contributors we

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,399
have that's the question

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,559
then we can use the metric of number of

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,519
new contributors

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,120
for that last month or for how many

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,919
active contributors do we have we can

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,840
have a metric

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,840
number of active contributors

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,080
so going through the gold question

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,000
metric approach gives us

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,080
not just what metrics should we focus on

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,279
but also a rationale

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,639
for why we look at it and it

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:12,000
we can start to tell the story hey

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,000
number of new contributors is this and

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,839
we are growing our contributors here's

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,839
how we are creating value

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,839
here's how we are having an impact

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,599
we need to start telling these stories

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:34,000
that are larger than the individual

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:48,879
numbers the individual metrics

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:50,879
any thoughts on metric strategy

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,240
another thing that is interesting to

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,000
look at

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:59,359
is collaboration patterns

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,680
and here this network

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:06,720
diagram shows our chaos community

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,520
the blue bars are repositories

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,760
if i were to zoom in in in the dashboard

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,160
which you can find on chaos.biturge.io

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,720
you could actually read the label names

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,119
the repository names

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,800
and then the dots are individual

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,359
contributors

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,560
the larger dots means contributors who

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,720
have more commits

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,839
small dots have fewer commits

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,400
and then we draw lines between the

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,280
people

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,960
the dots and the blue bars the

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,880
repositories if

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,599
a person made a commit to a specific

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,599
repository

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,680
and so we can see here in the middle we

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,920
have one repository that

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,920
has a lot of people who do contribute to

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,240
it

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,839
and that is our governance repository

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:04,560
on the right we have a cluster of

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,240
a few very active contributors

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,160
with a lot of repositories around them

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,160
and then outside of contributors

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,839
and that's that cluster on the right

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,839
that is our grimoire lab project

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,920
and the people in the middle are the

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:25,200
baturgia employees the company that is

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,079
the main steward and maintainer of the

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,560
project so you can see i can start to

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,119
tell a story

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,320
with this visualization with this way

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,320
the data is presented

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,359
and then auger is the repository

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,640
at the bottom there's agar being at the

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,839
university

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,160
they often ask students in classes to

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,119
make contributions as part of their

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,119
learning experience

00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,400
so we sometimes see spikes of

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,200
activity because students have their

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,200
assignments too

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,960
so collaboration patterns is for one you

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,960
know

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,720
what is the map of our community where

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,920
do people contribute to

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,200
how active are they in different parts

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,599
collaboration patterns is also when are

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,839
we contributing

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,720
is it during work hours is it uh during

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,200
weekends

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,160
gives us an idea for what kind of

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,960
community

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,960
are we looking at

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,320
is it professionals who work as part of

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,560
their job on this project or is it

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,800
volunteers working outside their regular

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,160
work hours

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,359
or what time zones are contributing

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,960
where are the people located are we all

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,599
in the european time zones

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,079
are we all in dublin or are we spread

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,440
out

00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:00,800
some from india some from north america

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,480
some from asia

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,440
time zone is a good or

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,160
somewhat acceptable proxy to geographic

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
location

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,240
although you know we don't get the whole

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,040
north versus south

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,800
difference but we get an idea for how

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,400
globally

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400
distributed as our community

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:33,839
and i'm pausing again to see if anyone

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,839
wants to chime in

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,160
ah christopher

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,520
messaged in the chat hi georg i am

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,119
completely new to this field and in fact

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,240
misunderstood the meaning of

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,720
the title of the session i took the term

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,640
health

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,079
literally as i'm interested in the

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,960
social application of

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,320
open source but maybe that doesn't

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,280
matter too much

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,680
talking of stories there is a task

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,800
demystifying metrics and data

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,800
to the lay people

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,359
so there are two things that

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,320
you said here and thank you very much

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,680
for

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,720
making that comment um

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,079
health we're not talking about medical

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,480
health or the health of

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,240
people here we're talking about the

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,680
community health

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,599
so how well are

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,599
the how well is the community doing

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,920
and when i heard health the first time i

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,520
also

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,160
only had the medical health in mind

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,960
maybe that's because i was from germany

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,920
originally and so english was my second

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,320
language i have not heard health being

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,480
used

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,520
for the health of a system a health of a

00:39:52,480 --> 00:40:00,400
machine or health of a car or whatever

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,400
um so yeah there are different uses

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,440
and open source is being used

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,480
quite a bit for so i'm totally going off

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,680
on attention

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,280
and christopher if you want to open up

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,400

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:24,000
say something please do so

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:27,359
you can also stop me

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,599
they're open so

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,480

um i just wanted to you know be polite

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,960
um carry on finish your point please

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,319
oh i was just going to say that there

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,520
are many

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,319
open source projects in the medical

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,000
health

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,950
field libra health new health are just

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,520
two projects that come to mind

00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,200
[Music]

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,119
so yeah that was the only thing i wanted

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,800
to say here

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:06,000
okay um

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,800
but i yeah i mean as i said this is

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
this is a you know first time experience

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,200
for me

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,960
um but i'm fascinated by the the what

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,680
seems to be a

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,000
really different mentality that perhaps

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,680
is

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,560
just part of open source thinking

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,800
um but you know as a newcomer i'm just

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:31,520
stunned really by

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,839
its um i don't know it's potential and

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,440
how

00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:38,880
how how different it is from

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,319
from the way standard ways of thinking

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,359
that the rest of us exist in and yet

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:49,440
you know it does have applications

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:53,200
um at whatever level you're working on

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,240
and it it seems um it seems

00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,000
you know so important

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,119
for evolution as a as a as a planet

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,400
and um but

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,280
um yeah so i'm grateful to all of you

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,079
but i'm also i'm also

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,960
interested in how you set about um i

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,960
mean other than

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,040
having a you know an open door how you

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,280
set about

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,680
sort of um yeah telling the narrative

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,319
of what you're offering to people that

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,839
don't

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,440
speak your language i'll stop

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,640
waffling

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,560
well thank you and before i take

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,560
the air out of the room i'm going to

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:45,839
pause and see if anyone else

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:45,839
has some thoughts and wants to reply

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,680
so as a facilitator i need to be very

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,680
comfortable with silence

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,720
but i yeah so no it's a

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,240
it's a really great reminder that

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:13,839
the way open source works and

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,880
this collaborative first approach that

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:20,400
we have developed in the open source

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,520
projects and communities is something

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:27,839
quite to cherish

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,839
with a lot of potential

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,480
so yeah the the thing that

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,359
this birds of feather is about is how do

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,400
we

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,359
understand this collaboration this

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,119
way of working together through metrics

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,480
and how do we

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,319
um help to enhance it take it to the

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,440
next level and identify where the

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:53,359
collaboration breaks down

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,480
where we're losing out on the

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,980
opportunities that we

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,130
would have

00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:59,130
[Music]

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,079
one thing that you said sorry i didn't

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,359
mean to interrupt you

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:12,560
no no no go ahead

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:15,200
uh one thing that you said was

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,000
we need to tell the story of what we are

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,720
doing

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,720
to others who are not familiar with our

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,400
work

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,319
and this is true for talking about how

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,440
we as a community are doing

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:32,960
about the health and the metrics

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,720
but it's also true about the work that

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,480
we're doing on the software

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,079
or whatever we are producing as a

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,760
community

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:45,200
and talking with the users

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,680
and this is where marketing

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,400
we can learn a lot from marketing

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,839
because

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:56,240
marketing as a profession

00:44:51,839 --> 00:45:00,640
is concerned with how do you take

00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:04,160
what what you have and talk about it

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:08,560
and involve others who are

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:11,520
not familiar with it before who

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,400
use different language identifying what

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,640
words they use

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,079
so those are things that come to mind

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,880
from listening to

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,880
what you said

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,800
yeah um that's that's interesting

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,560
it puts it puts marketing which can seem

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,160
quite aggressive

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,640
into a different light you know it's

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,880
it's it's nice to think of it as a way

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,230
of breaking the ice

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,839
which we probably all want to do

00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,319
[Music]

00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:50,160
um

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:53,599
yeah it's uh

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:56,560
sorry yeah

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,319
as you said marketing we often associate

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,640
with the

00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,720
with the spam that we get and the

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,839
letters in the mailbox and the

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,599
billboards

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,040
but that's just one form of

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,319
communication

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:13,680
um when i studied

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,319
marketing which i i didn't study study

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,839
marketing

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:20,240
marketing was part of my education um

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,440
the emphasis was really about

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,920
communicating

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,920
marketing is the department in a company

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,839
that

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,839
works on the messaging the communication

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,839
so one

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,720
so so moving forward i i'm happy to talk

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,720
more about this

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,880
um but i can also go on

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,880
i have one quick thing to add if you

00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,599
yeah if you want

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,880
um i you know getting back to uh the

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,119
comment earlier about

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,880
storytelling i think i think the

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,000
interpretation of metrics is really

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,599
important like

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,160
you know i'm part of the chaos project

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,599
i'm a big fan of data and metrics but

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,280
but it really only tells part of the

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,960
story like what looks good for one

00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,079
project isn't necessarily good for

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,200
another

00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,680
and i think that there's a lot a lot

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,760
that's

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,880
left for interpretation and i think that

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,920
interpretation

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,760
and being able to explain the data

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,280
i think is really important it's an

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,520
important part of thinking about project

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
health

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,400
yeah thank you don

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:52,400
another thing to consider is

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:57,040
avoid gaming of metrics so

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:59,200
if you're having metrics focused on

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,200
people and they can do certain actions

00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,240
to raise on a leaderboard

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,559
which maybe you recognize the image that

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,839
i have here on the left

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:12,559
it's from our current conference

00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,240
then you get that behavior you get what

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,559
you measure

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,559
and

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,040
with we saw this recently or just this

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,640
month with

00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,119
oktoberfest where the measurement was

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,920
pull requests created it was not about

00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,119
the

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,680
quality and so there was a big

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,119
outcry at the beginning of this month

00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,800
because a lot of people

00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:41,040
started creating pull requests that were

00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,160
not that they were taking a lot of time

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,119
from maintainers

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,960
but didn't add anything to the projects

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,839
um

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,240
if you have been following twitter and

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,079
other

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,680
conversations you would have heard about

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,960
that and

00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,079
hacktoberfest actually changed the rules

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,760
um to accommodate that

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,240
but you get the same thing in your

00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,200
communities if you

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,160
value commits over other types of

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,280
contributions

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,520
then people will start to

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,720
find ways to get more commits making

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,599
smaller contributions

00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,559
having a different commit for every typo

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,559
that gets fixed

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:30,480
so just be mindful about what you

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:33,680
do with the data and how you reward

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:38,400
if there's any reward

00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,400
committee members based on that data

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,640
so those are the things that

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,440
i had brought as a seed

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,839
to the discussion i want to leave you

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,960
with

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,960
some resources so i'm going to leave

00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,319
this slide up

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,640
um i have one one more slide if you

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,599
wanted to connect with me

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,400

twitter and linkedin you can email me

00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:16,400
but really this is

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:20,160
what i wanted to give to you and

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,960
we have a podcast where we talk about

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,839
specific use cases experiences with

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,119
metrics and measuring and community

00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:30,559
health

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:33,440
we have the metrics the software

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,000
and you're also welcome to join we have

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,280
regular

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,760
meetings we have the different working

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:44,559
groups you have a mailing list

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,559
if you go to chaos.community participate

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,559
you can find a community that is talking

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,400
about

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:56,640
metrics and participating and

00:50:52,400 --> 00:51:00,160
don already said she was there

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,400
which i really enjoy always when we

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,400
are on the same zoom calls talking about

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,480
metrics

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:12,720
so this my invitation to you

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:16,480
and i'm again opening this up

00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,480
what thoughts what questions do you have

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:23,839
i don't actually know how much time we

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,839
have left

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,400
this against when speaking i'm still

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,520
trying to grasp

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,119
um what every what is covered by chaos

00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,280
and what is maybe not

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,480
um so one thing or what i really like is

00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,200
when you were talking about this

00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,359
dashboard and made this um

00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,319
example with the car and maybe also the

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,160
car test

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,760
for cars i think it's pretty easy you

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,079
have a checklist of things that you

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,760
want to take like tire pressure and then

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,960
you know okay the car is healthy or

00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,960
working

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,960
but do you have something like those

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,240
checklists for open source projects or

00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,160
is it even possible from your

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,599
perspective

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:04,319
to do something like that that's

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,119
an excellent question and ever since we

00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,920
started

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,559
chaos as our community of practice where

00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,920
we talk about these things

00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,960
the we've been asked hey just give us

00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,200
the

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,640
10 things the five things that we should

00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,040
be measuring

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,520
and tell us whether it's in a good range

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,520
or not

00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:31,200
and we cannot

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:33,359
have these here's what a good project

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,400
looks like here's what a

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:39,280
problematic project looks like

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,280
because every community works different

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,839
and is different

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,599
and so you really need a domain expert

00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,319
someone who is in the community who can

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,359
say

00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:53,359
yes the numbers are how they are because

00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:56,160
we work in this way so just because

00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,680
projects use github and they share that

00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,760
technology

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,599
they have different ways that they're

00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,280
using github

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:09,200
some make it very clear that you need to

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:12,240
link poll requests to issues

00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,200
others are more loose about that where

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,200
you don't need an

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:21,119
issue to create a pull request

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,160
or some use don't even use the issue

00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,400
tracker in github

00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,400
they use the issue tracker over in

00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:32,640
jira so

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:36,000
what we can have is a checklist

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,559
of saying hey you want to make sure your

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,520
community is doing well

00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,200
so you look at the activity metrics we

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,760
can't help you

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,280
say you have 500 commits that's good or

00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,880
bad but we can say hey

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,200
the number of commits is something to

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,280
look at and if there's a change

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,040
in your number of commits that is

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,880
something you know you need to

00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,400
understand as a community is that

00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,680
why is that happening and tell the story

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,440
interpret that so you want to look at

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,599
the community

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:12,880
um the academic research shows that

00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:17,040
code quality can be a sign

00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:19,280
of community health resources

00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,640
do we have financial support do we have

00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,079
all the tools and

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,839
necessary diversity and inclusion if

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,200
you're talking about how welcoming and

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,720
inclusive do people feel

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,480
are they enjoying being part of the

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:34,079
community are we welcoming

00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:37,760
new people in do we have a good rotation

00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,359
of people coming and leaving because not

00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,880
most people don't stay forever in the

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,720
community

00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:47,119
what's our bus factor do we have too

00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,440
few people who carry the bulk of the

00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,440
work

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:55,040
um so we do have these questions and if

00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:59,200
you go to the chaos

00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,200
metrics you can see them

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,960
and we're building out more and more of

00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,839
those

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,599
so sven did that help you

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,040
get the difference of what chaos does

00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,760
and what

00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,200
does not do this really leads me in the

00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,839
right direction

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,960
i mean there's a lot of work uh some

00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,280
work on

00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,280
those issues also on how to build those

00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,400
community like social architecture

00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,400
said something other singer so

00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,040
i feel something in that direction maybe

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,079
background of my question was um

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,640
i had situations where i was thinking of

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,880
new

00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,760
uh of open source projects or maybe

00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,000
starting

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,880
projects then a manager would ask me

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
okay

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,480
why is it successful and so the question

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,760
here is okay what is actually success

00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,839
tell me what you consider

00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,520
success and i can tell you why it will

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,839
be successful and

00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,799
i feel somehow goes in the direction of

00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,760
community health

00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:03,280
as well because maybe sometimes you

00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,079
there's such a situation where you

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,599
really want only

00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,520
two or three people really working on

00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,200
the project or it's

00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,599
maybe the best solution sometimes it's

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,599
not so

00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,040
yes absolutely that's where

00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,359
the gold question metric approach comes

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,680
in you define what does success mean

00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,599
to you or your manager and then you

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,079
figure out how do we

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,079
show that

00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:33,119
oh thank you don for sharing the link in

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,119
the chat

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,000
well we are out of time i really

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,200
appreciate you all

00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,599
coming to this birds of feather and

00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,200
having a conversation about how we

00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:49,200
understand community health

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,359
and how we use metrics um

00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,119
again if you were well if you're

00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:56,880
interested in keeping this conversation

00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:58,480
going join us in the chaos project

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,240
feel free to reach out if you have

00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,119
questions to me

00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:07,040
and i wish you all a good rest of your

00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,040
open source summit europe conference

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,839
thanks for facilitating george

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,839
thanks thank you christopher take care
