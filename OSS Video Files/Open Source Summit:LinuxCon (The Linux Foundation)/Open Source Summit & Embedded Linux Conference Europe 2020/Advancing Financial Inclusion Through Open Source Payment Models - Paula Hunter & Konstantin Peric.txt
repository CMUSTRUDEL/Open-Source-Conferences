hello everyone

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,759
uh welcome to this advancing financial

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,039
inclusion through

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,400
open source payment model session

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,039
my name is costa perry i will be

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,080
co-presenting

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,080
co-presenting with paula hunter hi paula

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,199
i am as i said cosmetic the modular

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,640
foundation

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,280
chair of the board i also am deputy

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,440
director

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,719
at the billionaire linda gates

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
foundation

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,440
in the financial services for the poor

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,440
strategy

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,000
so let's dive in let me ask you this

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
question

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,239
first um do you know

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,520
how people who are

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,300
unbanked and who typically earn

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,409
less than two dollars on average per day

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,409
[Music]

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,720
so here is a symbol that represents

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,479
their lives

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:17,119
because basically they need to work

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,119
all day to pay for things

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,520
it is expensive to be poor because

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,720
if you only have cash to deal

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,360
for your transactions then

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
essentially you are required to work to

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,920
work

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,680
um to pay for

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,119
the tuition of your child at school

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,159
to pay for your utility bill

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,640
to bring money

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
to another family member in another

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,200
village

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,399
who needs the money so you walk

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
and you walk and you walk and you lose

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,719
time

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,920
energy in just dealing with cash

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,119
and having to

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,800
deal all day with cash for your

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,400
financial transactions

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,520
there are still 1.7 billion

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,959
people on the planet in this

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,959
situation 400 million

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,080
africans on the african continent are in

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,680
this situation

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,599
and uh the the situation

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,560
also is skewed uh with a big gender gap

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,440
there are more women in this case than

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,760
there are men

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:46,560
overall from 60 to even 70

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,280
so 10 to 20 gender gaps sometimes

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,480
so digital financial inclusion is

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,239
essentially

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,360
about connecting this

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,360
this population to an adequate

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
digital financial system through their

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,200
mobile phones

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,319
and the instrument for that

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,360
actually was invented 10 years ago

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,440
already the first innovation happened in

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,480
kenya 10 years ago in fact

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,959
more than 10 years ago um with the

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,680
system called m-pesa

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,720
and uh that system essentially allowed

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,599
people

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,680
to send money using very simple mobile

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,400
phones not smartphones

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,239
to to send money to each other pretty

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,080
much in the same way they sent

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:40,000
text messages and this

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,400
um this system that was provided

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,519
not by a bank but by a telco company

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,879
uh has proven immensely useful

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,599
for people in households

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,319
uh that were that are were unbanked and

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,439
done dealt

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,920
only with cash um

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,599
it is an instrument of poverty

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,239
alleviation

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,280
in the sense that when when the people

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,280
get connected

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,560
to a financial system they have a way to

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,840
save money they have they can better

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,320
manage their money they can better

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,160
manage their lives

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,680
and not walk all the time anymore

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,800
the other thing that empeza has proven

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,840
is that it is it can be

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,800
it can be profitable to actually serve

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,000
this core segment of the population with

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,919
a totally different

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,960
business model than traditional banks

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,160
so by 2018 then

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,639
uh this is the situation there were in

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,120
excess of 150

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,440
uh and today actually more than 200

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,199
mobile money operations

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,199
across africa as well in

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,880
south asia and you can see here some of

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,320
the statistics

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,080
but it is for example impressive that

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,600
in kenya 68 of adults

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,280
even more today use mobile money

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,720
daily and you can see some other

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,240
impressive numbers showing again how

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,479
digital technology can serve

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,880
in connecting and increasing financial

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,080
inclusion

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,120
so then uh so

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,440
we are there uh uh today as i mentioned

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
there are still 1.7 billion people

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,960
we came down at the beginning of the

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,960
last decade from 2.5 billion people so

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,840
progress is being made

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,600
but uh there is still a huge uh

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
population out there

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
that we need to connect in the movement

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,560
we essentially need to accelerate the

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
movement

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
uh considerably so a new wave of

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,440
innovation

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
needs to happen and that wave actually

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,319
happened

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,800
in is happening in tanzania and in one

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,080
word

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,319
it's about interoperability of these

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,919
mobile money services

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,919
one of the issues with as good as

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,160
i've shown you the mobile money was

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,160
from many perspectives one of the issue

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,440
that remains is that the majority of the

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,120
mobile money

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,120
operations are siloed in the sense that

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,400
the standard and receiver of the payment

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,440
need to be on the same

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,639
network so if you think about this if

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,600
you had a

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
phone uh where you could talk to people

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,800
on

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,039
only on the same network as you would be

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,240
useful but obviously not

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,319
very pervasive and so this next wave of

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,680
interoperability happened in tanzania

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,120
when the four

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,479
mobile money operations started

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,160
inter-operating

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
and uh what what is happening so that

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
was

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,840
a few years ago today uh

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,960
there is um uh a program that is driven

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,199
by the

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,880
tanzanian central bank that will connect

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,639
the whole country

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,960
in an interactive way not only the

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,720
mobile money operations but

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,000
uh also uh the traditional uh banks

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,520
uh and hence a women

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,400
woman in tanzania that is uh

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,240
that has a mobile wallet on a mobile

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,120
money operation now can

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
reset and receive money between many uh

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,319
across all of these mobile money

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
networks but also

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,879
uh from bankers you can receive salary

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,919
from a bank account you can pay

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,319
other people who have a bank account so

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,240
let's

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,720
look at uh what actually does

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,520
interoperability bring

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,879
let me play this short video to show you

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:13,080
what happened in tanzania

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:54,870
a few years ago

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:54,870
[Music]

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,720
so you can see how interoperability

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,040
actually enables this scaling

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,640
that is needed and that i was talking

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,760
about and today

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,959
um the there is a project on

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,880
on the scale of the whole country not

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,839
only on the mobile money operators

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,560
to have interoperability entertainment

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,399
platform

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,279
on a country scale and mojo loop as we

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,920
will see

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,920
is the technology that enables this

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,640
so interoperability as i said is the

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,080
next wave of

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,839
innovation that will hopefully

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,040
allow us to reduce the 1.7 billion

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,080
people number

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,320
i hope to zero by the end of this decade

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,920
by connecting systems uh together

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,959
and mojadoop was actually developed

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,600
as an open source as a software

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,800
that provides easily this

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
interoperability

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,040
between different systems be it uh

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,640
mobile money operations be it uh

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,279
even um blockchain uh systems

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
and uh so mo mojo loop has been

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,640
developed as

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
one of the key assets that will enable

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,880
this acceleration

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,279
and hence accelerate financial inclusion

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,320
before handing over to paula let me just

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,640
tell you a little bit

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,000
how these country-wide programs

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,160
work uh today tanzania

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,560
was a pioneer as we say but there are

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,399
many other countries and regions

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,200
in africa and south asia who have uh

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,160
also progressed uh and typically there

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,560
are these

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:52,399
four layers that require attention

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,680
rules rails accounts and applications

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,160
rules are as the name says

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,320
everything that's required about setting

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,240
up the right regulatory and governance

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,959
framework because uh it is not because

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,000
we

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,560
deal and have services for the poor that

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,680
there shouldn't be rules and regulations

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
at the contrary

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,160
we should protect this population even

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,440
more against fraud

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,279
for example so very important aspect

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,000
rails is the actual infrastructure

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,880
and this is a collaborative space where

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
mojado

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
plays where mocha loop is an enabler to

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
provide

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,040
essentially a shared country-wide or

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,160
even regional wide in

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,839
payment infrastructure that has the

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,600
characteristics that pola

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,640
will talk about why is this important

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,760
it is important so that there is a rich

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,639
ecosystem of accounts be mobile money

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,240
wallets

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:57,680
or traditional bank accounts uh thriving

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:02,000
on these rates but even more importantly

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,519
to connect new innovative applications

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,320
to these rails that serve the population

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,320
for example solar pay as you go

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,120
transportation services

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,760
all these services that require vast

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,360
amounts

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,440
of small value payments so that's the

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,839
stage that i wanted to set

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,079
for uh mojadoop and i i will now hand

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,000
over

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:31,760
to paula who can explain

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,399
how moja loop enables this

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,519
economy that is open where everyone

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
benefits

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,959
from an economy that includes everyone

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,480
pola

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,480
please the floor is yours

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,160
thank you costa i'll switch over to my

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
deck

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
okay so thank you everyone for joining

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,560
us today

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,600
um i want to talk a little bit more

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,760
about

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,639
the modes loop project and the mojo loop

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,440
foundation

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,160
and how we can address uh the the issue

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,360
of financial inclusion that costa has

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,680
given you some insights on the first of

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
all

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,880
uh as as costa mentioned mojo loop is an

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
open source software stack

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,360
it's designed to enable interoperability

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,399
across payment service providers

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,200
so this was a fundamental decision made

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,440
in how we address financial occlusion is

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,880
to leverage the benefits of the open

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,480
source development model

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,480
to deliver this functionality to the

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,880
marketplace

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,880
the the design of moji loop was based on

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,959
financial inclusion principles

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,120
uh detailed by the gates foundation

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,040
to provide an open loop group

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,120
interoperability between providers

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,839
to have adherence to international

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,240
financial inclusion standards

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,079
have a push payment model with immediate

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,839
funds transferred

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,240
and same-day settlement so no waiting

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,240
for

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,839
cash uh adequate system-wide fraud and

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,160
security protection

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,320
and as i'm sure you all can appreciate

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,000
collaborating on addressing fraud and

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,000
security protection across a

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,839
group of participants is a more

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,519
efficient way to address this than

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,000
as a silo we wanted efficient uh

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,560
proportional identity and know your

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,639
customer

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,720
requirements we wanted to meet or exceed

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:38,399
the benefits and utility of cash

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,079
in these days of covid we can certainly

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
appreciate the fact that more and more

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,720
countries around the globe

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,240
are trying to reduce their use of cash

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,839
and of course what we wanted to do is

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,880
make sure that the platform was

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,079
customizable so that folks could adjust

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,199
the platform to meet their needs and

00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,480
um and their both the regulatory and

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,160
their their local needs

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,680
and how are we doing this well first of

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,880
all what we decided to do

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,639
uh earlier this year is launch the moja

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,880
loop foundation

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,320
and this foundation similar to many of

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
the organizations that you may be

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,079
affiliated with

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,040
has a mission to deliver open source

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,079
software

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,880
to address uh the financial

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:27,519
inclusion mission

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,560
we're doing this with a with a mix of

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,920
participants

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,440
we have the the generosity of charitable

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,279
organizations such as the bill and

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,360
melinda gates foundation

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,720
uh the rockefeller foundation omidyar

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
network who are

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,560
aligned with us on our mission and want

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,120
to help support our efforts to

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,440
to address this challenge we also have

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
technology providers such as google coil

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,600
modus box

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,360
ripple george digital and cyberin these

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,920
companies are

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,720
very uh well positioned in the payment

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,320
space

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,160
they understand the challenges we're

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
trying to address with respect to

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,040
financial inclusion

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
and they're bringing engineering

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,720
resources to bear to help us

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,839
address this this challenge

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,920
the mojo foundation was formed

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,600
this year as i mentioned but we've had a

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,839
lot of history

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,639
since 2016 where we kicked off the

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,839
project

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,680
as an open source development effort

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,839
we've gone through three full phases of

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,240
development over those years

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,000
we're now in phase four development

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,759
wrapping that up this year and we'll

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
move into phase five

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,440
so we have a pretty robust code base

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
already in place

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,199
and in fact have several deployments uh

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
underway

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,959
right now one of those deployments is

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,720
malwali which is a joint venture between

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,199
orange and mtn

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,399
two very large mobile network operators

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
in africa

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,320
and they're collaborating to deliver a

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,199
mojo loop

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,880
based system to their customer base and

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,920
that has recently gone live and will

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,559
continue to expand across the continent

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,959
we also have the bank of tanzania which

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,360
is

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,039
uh currently in development of a mojo

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,120
loop based platform

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,079
as costa alluded to earlier in his

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,880
slides

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,600
so we're in a really good position now

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,199
to

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,799
leverage all that hard work our

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,679
developers have put into this

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,000
the code base um and and start rolling

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,720
out

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,559
new deployments around the world i mean

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,079
we we talk about africa a lot and it's

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,440
an important sector for us

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,720
because of the uh proportion of citizens

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
that are unbanked

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,960
uh but they're certainly uh used for for

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,520
this platform all over the world

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,640
um even in in my own country the united

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,160
states there's still

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,160
a disparity in uh financial services

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,080
delivered to the poor and unbanked

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,919
as far as how we uh go about the

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,400
development of mojo loop

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,760
uh what we've done is we we certainly

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,640
have a community driven

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,280
driven development process uh that said

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,559
we

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,200
adhered to an agile development model um

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,039
we are rapidly designing building

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,000
configuring testing and

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,320
rolling out new iterations uh three

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,919
three

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,799
four times a year um our our community

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,440
meets four

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,160
four times a year for a week uh in fact

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,080
the week of

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,280
october 19th they'll be they'll be

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,600
meeting

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,520
um uh faced not face-to-face i'm sorry

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,120
virtually we used to hold them face to

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,720
face but as you know we're all in a

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,559
virtual world now

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,799
but at those meetings um what the

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,960
community does is evaluate progress on

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,559
work to date and establish priorities

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,120
for the next program increment

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,559
and then we just rinse wash repeat this

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,799
is a cycle that we're now

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,480
this is our 12th program increment

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,280
starting the week of uh

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,880
october 19th so the community is pretty

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,679
well accustomed to

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,840
a mode of operation and welcoming to

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,160
others that want to jump on board and

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,840
contribute to the work streams

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
that community does vote on the work

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,760
streams based on

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
on market requirements and gap analysis

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,480
and then that

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,520
sets the priorities for the next program

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,679
increment

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,120
that said it's a very open process it's

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,320
inclusive of developers

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,320
implementers and customers we we welcome

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
all to those those convenings they're

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
always

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,400
open and free to anyone that wants to

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,440
participate

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
and the agenda spans from business

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,120
issues to

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,360
technical issues to market issues um

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,280
so it's it's a very diverse set of

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,320
people that are contributing to those

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,400
uh workstream discussions every every 12

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,320
or 13 weeks

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,640
we entered phase four of our development

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,120
cycle in january of this year

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,880
as i said we're wrapping it up and um

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,600
we'll start phase five in january 2021.

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,679
so uh we'd welcome you to hop on and and

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:57,120
join us in that effort

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,120
i'd be remiss in not identifying some of

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,280
the key technologies that are the

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,840
underpinnings of the mojo loop

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,120
offering of course it's a linux based

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
solution

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,440
but there are many other technologies

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
that you're probably familiar with

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,679
that are dependencies in rolling out

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,640
emoji loop instance

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,159
so as you see noted here many of you are

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
probably affiliated with some of these

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,159
open source organizations

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,400
and we thank you for your ongoing

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,919
support of those platforms

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,320
that are so important to our work

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,240
the other thing about the mojo loop

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,440
that's important to note is that

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,640
we have um we're hosting agnostic

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,760
uh we have uh amazon web services uh

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
platform that we're using for

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,400
development

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,640
we have azure instances that have been

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,159
tested out uh but what we're finding

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,080
particularly in developing countries

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,760
there is a need and an interest

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,720
in holding the the the deployment close

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,960
to home

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,320
there's regulatory issues there's data

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
privacy issues

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,919
and so we want to make sure that any

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,320
option is open to

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,320
to the customers they can use a

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,200
cloud-based service or they can host it

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,400
on premises

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,840
themselves uh there's a lot more detail

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,360
about the technology

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,200
and for those of you that know me it'd

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,320
be dangerous for me to go too far into

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,080
the architecture

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,240
but there is a lot of information on our

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,120
github repository about the architecture

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,120
and all these

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,120
technologies and how they how they play

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,200
in in the design of the system

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,960
so i'd encourage you to check that out

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,159
at the link shared on the slide

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,320
for a little bit more about the

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,559
community um

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,559
as i mentioned we've been operating now

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,440
as an open source project for nearly

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,799
four years

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,840
um and what we've done is over that time

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,240
is developed a very strong base of

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,200
participants

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,919
across all spectrums you know financial

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,240
services

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:55,039
payment platforms uh central banks

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,760
regulators and and developers

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,039
uh and developers are obviously key to

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,080
our code base

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,960
but having over 650 participants

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,400
providing

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,320
feedback requirements input testing etc

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,320
is really important and we'll continue

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,480
to grow this this community

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,799
as the project evolves it's uh the

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,679
community spans six continents in 47

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,640
countries

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,120
so we have a very well-rounded voice uh

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,000
providing input into the project

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,760
um and as i mentioned earlier we have 10

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
members that have recently joined the

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,600
foundation when we launched

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
providing operational and governance

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,919
support

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,919
to to the legal entity

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,880
what we really have set out to do is

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,320
build an ecosystem that benefits

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,320
everyone

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,559
fintechs and banks can use the code to

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,200
modify their existing systems or to

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,200
enhance

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,400
uh what their their offer they have

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,679
today as far as platform

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,559
payments platforms uh

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,320
central banks can speed up deployment of

00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,760
national payment gateways with

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,679
commercial partners

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,640
so a good example that's like this is

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,200
such as bank of tanzania has done

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,039
governments can use mojo loop to deliver

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
support payments to citizens right into

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,200
their mobile wallets

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,760
merchants can have customers pay their

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,799
bills directly from their phones

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,320
and and users uh to to custis point

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,600
don't necessarily have to walk miles

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,440
anymore to

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,280
transfer money to friends and family

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,480
members it can be simply done via their

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,960
their mobile phone so we we building out

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,919
this

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,679
robust ecosystem and again welcoming all

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,120
to participate in the ongoing

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,400
development efforts

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,720
as they progress and

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
well mobile wallets are an important

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,880
factor here

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,919
um and and they've really made cashless

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,640
transactions

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,120
easier but they're often isolated from

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,679
mainstream financial providers

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,760
so we had too many stovepipes and what

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,000
we wanted wanted to do with mogeloop was

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,480
ensure that there was interoperability

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
across all the different players in the

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,440
in the ecosystem

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,720
to allow a consumer to be able to

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:12,400
use the the tool of choice for them

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,679
that makes sense with a relationship

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,760
with a business

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,320
or a bank or government um as needed

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,200
but have the ability to exchange that

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,080
money across

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,440
very various different providers so that

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,960
thus the interoperability

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,200
is so key so how do we

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,720
enable interoperability in this payment

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,679
platform

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,120
there's four key components to this

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,039
first of all there's an interoperability

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,360
layer that connects bank accounts

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,640
mobile money wallets and merchants in an

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,880
open loop system

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,320
emphasis open loop that's that's an

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,760
important uh

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,559
shift for uh payments in particularly in

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,080
in the developing countries second we

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,000
provide a directory

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,880
service layer that navigates the methods

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,600
that providers use to identify accounts

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,720
on each side of a transaction

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,520
so ensure that those accounts are are

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,799
validated

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,320
and um and accurate

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,000
third we provide a transaction

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,640
settlement layer that makes payments

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,039
instant and irrevocable the instant is

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,360
so

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,120
important if if you're making two

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,600
dollars a day or living on two dollars a

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,840
day

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,960
you can't afford to be without that cash

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,640
for several days

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,159
and that's that's something that we want

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,679
to change

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,279
and then what we have is components

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,520
designed um

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,480
for implementing strong internal fraud

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,600
controls

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,600
uh so the fraud and risk management is a

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,000
very important point uh for

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,799
for all financial institutions to

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,559
navigate

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,480
and we wanted to make it a flexible

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,360
approach so that they can

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,320
refine their solution based on local and

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,039
regulatory

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,039
requirements

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,840
i i want to stop for a moment and talk

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,240
about

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,200
the advantages of open source software

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,320
to uh

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,520
to to the uh masses in this room so to

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
speak that are already

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,960
indoctrinated but i think it's important

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,600
for

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,400
us to recognize something that you all

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,600
have adopted uh for some time now

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,279
and and enjoy the benefits of uh in

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,440
the projects that you've been working

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,120
with first of all

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,919
uh with open source and the mojulu

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,120
platform

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,760
the capital cost upfront is lower first

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,080
of all

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,559
there's no licensing fee but also we've

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,559
made it easy for someone to test it out

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,640
download it create an entire mojo loop

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,200
instance on a laptop test it out and

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,760
then

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,039
move from there so very low entry uh

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,559
barrier to entry

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:50,080
and and and testing out the system lower

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,760
maintenance costs uh because the the

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,520
the effort is shared across many

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,520
organizations

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,960
one company does not have to pay for all

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,400
the maintenance costs doesn't have to

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,320
hire all the developers to do the

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,240
maintenance the community will continue

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,520
to maintain it

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,360
there's no vendor lock-in again

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,559
when you when you deploy a system like

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,480
this it's in for

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,159
the long haul it's not you don't swap

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,880
out your payment platform every two

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,640
years

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,200
and so what you want to make sure is

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,760
that uh you don't have vendor lock-in

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,120
you're not

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,039
at the whims of a com of a commercial

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,919
company that might say time to upgrade

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,559
or time to add

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,520
to pay more for new features uh you're

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,480
you're free from

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,880
that lock-in and and also there's a

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,840
lower

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
lower cost to acquire additional

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,919
functionality

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
i mean let's face it there's you know is

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,279
when you look at banking systems and

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,799
financial systems there's some rules and

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,399
regulations that are

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,279
are unique to your country but there are

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,279
many others that are common across many

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,120
different countries and regions

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,399
and when you have an issue with your

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,240
system uh

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,000
you come back to the community and the

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,760
community might work on it

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,840
and find that there's five or ten or

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,600
fifteen other entities that are having

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,240
the same issues and challenges

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,720
so that's through that collaboration the

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,000
community can develop new functionality

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,200
and again you're not opening the

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
checkbook to pay for that

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,960
and the long range uh the benefits uh

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,720
from

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,760
having this this ecosystem are profound

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,159
first of all at the individual level

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,200
it could reach well over a million and a

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,360
half

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,480
billion and a half individuals that

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:32,080
currently are unbanked or underserved

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,559
businesses not only can save money

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,720
with this type of platform but they also

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,600
can open up new avenues for

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,720
transactions and loans to small

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,880
businesses

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,200
and individuals digital financial

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,080
service providers can also

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,279
see tremendous business benefit and also

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,159
take some of the

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,799
uh costs associated with cash out of

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,640
their their operating expenses

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,480
and then governments can have a more

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,399
efficient way to deliver

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,600
uh their benefits and payments to to

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,960
their citizens

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,159
um in a in a more transparent and

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,159
uh interoperable way

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,320
so how to engage um there are a number

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,679
of

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,919
ways for folks to engage uh if you're

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,279

central bank uh you can adopt uh the

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,559
mojulu platform

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,440
use it to extend your current offerings

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,760
or to

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,399

talk to you and help you

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,440
walk through the the code base and

understand what the priorities are

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,600
and how you can engage and it's not just

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,720
coding there's there's testing that

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,559
needs to be done

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,760
there's documentation that needs to be

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,039
updated

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,480
