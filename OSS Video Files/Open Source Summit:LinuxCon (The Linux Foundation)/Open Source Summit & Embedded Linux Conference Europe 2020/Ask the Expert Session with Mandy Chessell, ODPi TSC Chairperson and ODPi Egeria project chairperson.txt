	00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,320
hello everybody

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,440
um i hope you can hear me uh my name's

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,640
mandy chessell and i'm the host for this

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,720
uh ask the expert session so

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
a little bit of background about me i've

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,439
been in the industry

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
um about uh third well well over 30

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
years

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,000
i worked on a large number of uh

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
projects

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
started on mainframe writing in uh

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,960
writing code in uh

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
assembler and uh over the last 30 years

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,040
as you know the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,960
industry has changed dramatically

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,760
and so i've worked on all sorts of

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,879
uh different types of technologies but

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,879
over the last

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,440
200 years i've been working on an open

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,440
source project called

00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,199
odpigeria which is all about

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,840
uh the integration of the knowledge that

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,920
uh tools require from your use of them

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,159
this is called metadata

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
um and allowing that to be exchanged

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,920
between different tools

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,119
so that an organization can be much more

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,960
coherent

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,360
because people are sharing the knowledge

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,479
that they're building

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,240
this came from an idea that a lot of

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,040
regulations were

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
requiring an organization to operate in

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
a very coherent

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,400
way and

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,799
the uh and so we actually started i've

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,400
been working with

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,079
other colleagues in ibm but also with

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,680
customers of ibm who see this problem

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,079
and are wanting to work with us to fix

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,399
it

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,360
so one of the major contributors we have

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,200
is a large

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,880
global bank called ing and we have been

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,159
collaborating together

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,960
to build that technology so

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,079
um i happy to answer questions on the

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,640
technology itself

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
my career uh different things i've

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,640
worked on

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,239
um it's really up to you uh what type of

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,440
questions you're interested in

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
asking um and i believe you can fill the

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,239
questions

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,920
in um in the uh in the application so

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,040
you can send me questions

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,560
and oh got a question

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
let's have a look and uh why did you

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
start working on it it's a really good

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,280
question so why did we start this

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,000
project on open source because

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,519
it's a very complex piece of software

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,959
and you could think well maybe that

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,160
could be a product

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,959
um but the reality is that what this

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,440
technology is trying to do is to connect

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,160
tools that come from different vendors

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,800
different open source projects and no

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,040
one

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
is going to integrate then no one is

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,560
going to allow a single

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,879
technical technology company to be

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,760
the only be that be the sort of

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
centralized

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
point where all this knowledge is is

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
enabled

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,400
so to so to make this work we needed

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,440
something

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,080
that was open fair

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,640
um and we used the linux foundation as

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,800
the

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,680
sort of the keeper of this technology so

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,640
that

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,319
it's a safe place for different vendors

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,080
to work together to come up with the

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,959
standards to build

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,840
the um you know to build this ecosystem

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,799
so

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
it was a big change for me having worked

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,239
in

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,319
building building software products for

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,879
a large company for so many years to

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,360
suddenly

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,239
start working in open source but to be

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,799
fair i

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
i love it i absolutely love the open

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,159
collaboration

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,680
and the fact that everything we do is so

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,440
much better than it would be if we

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
just focus from a single company's

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,080
perspective

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
so that's really why we started and uh

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,720
it's been a as i say it's been

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
it's been a great journey

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,640
so the next question is who else is

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,239
involved in the project

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,560
so um we it's so that

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,080
the the two companies that sort of

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,599
really started it were ibm

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,959
and the and ing but we also have

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,079
sas which is a very large uh analytics

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,160
company

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,720
um who have a lot of experience with

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,520
working with data and metadata

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,880
around um supporting companies building

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,080
their um

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,400
their analytics uh capability so they've

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
been

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,560
very interested um and they also sort of

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,639
like the third

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,680
um the third leg of the school to uh

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,320
to come together to do this

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
then we have other companies that are

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
perhaps a bit smaller

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
but they have very niche requirements

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,800
around

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,840
integration so um one of one of the

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,280
companies is the russian railways and

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,400
also we have worked with um companies

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,560
like manta and um

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
i spoke to a company called pivotal

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,880
recently

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
uh and and so we're seeing um we're

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,720
seeing uh

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,880
an increased interest around this the

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,680
you know the the not not just bigger

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,600
companies but also smaller companies

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,520
and then there are other much larger

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,680
companies or household names that are

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,440
starting to work with us

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,840
but i can't tell you who they are at the

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,360
moment it's really up to them to

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,600
do their announcements when they're

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,479
ready to do that

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,800
um so yeah so we have a very wide range

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,720
of

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,639
different people who are consuming it

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,360
who work for big companies who

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,440
are work for smaller companies and have

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,560
niche products

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,560
as well as people who have to work in a

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,840
very highly regulated industry and need

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
this type of technology

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,160
okay so any other

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,600
questions oh another one coming in thank

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,600
you very much

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,240
um all right so okay while working on

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,479
the project

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
are there things you've learned not to

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,919
do that you can share

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,960
um i think the most important thing not

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,039
to do

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,360
is to keep is to build something

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,199
privately until it's perfect because it

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,680
won't be perfect

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:31,520
and so um what we've learned is to share

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,720
ideas much earlier and to show

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,000
working prototypes and to get that

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,880
feedback

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,639
and you find that there's not that there

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,360
is no such thing as perfection

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,360
everything is working progress really

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,000
and really forgetting to use the

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,000
community

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,599
to get something down is uh is the

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
biggest thing that uh

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,720
uh that we've learned to you know to

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,759
make sure that we always

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,560
you know we we we don't sort of hide

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,759
things for

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,080
uh until you know and then just dump

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,000
this

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
massive feature without really talking

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,560
to people about it

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,880
so that's that's what we've learned not

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
to do

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:31,840
okay any other questions or follow-ups

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:31,840
for that

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,560
okay so the question really next one is

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,879
about the uh successes and

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,879
um

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,800
you think that was an easy one to do so

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,759
uh

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,400
we so there's there's different levels

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,039
of success so one of the things that's

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,240
been incredibly successful is the actual

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,280
technology

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,400
uh because we've built this with

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,599
so many experts around us it does

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,039
things that um that are completely

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,720
unique

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,759
in that it's able to create this

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,879
peer-to-peer sharing environment between

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,879
radically different tools through a

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,280
common language through an exchange

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,759
protocol that combines

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,440
replication of metadata as well as

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,200
federated queries

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
so that core piece which is the first

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,839
bit we did

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,519
that is self-configuring and

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,360
self-managing uh was actually

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,200
quite a major success to prove that we

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,480
could make that work

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,160
um and then building on that as we

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,640
started to bring metadata together a

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,640
whole new

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,720
raft of possibilities has opened up

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,640
and that has led to new modules to new

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,480
capability and things like that so

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,040
one of the major successes has been

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,040
because we are not a commercial product

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,959
we are not tied to a specific

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,839
market um we go where

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,480
the problem is and we've broken down not

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,440
only the

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,920
technology silos but also the thinking

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,519
silos about what a product

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,600
in a particular market can do so

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,920
that is that in itself has been

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,399
incredibly successful

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,040
and then just from the people's point of

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,080
view

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,160
in the in the project there isn't

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,519
a day almost that we don't learn

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,040
something

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,800
so that is also um

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,760
in terms of our skills um we're

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,040
it's like being a starter in that we

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,920
have to do everything we have to make

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,279
the build work we have to sort the

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,040
security problems out

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,920
we have to get the design right we have

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,320
to um get the ecosystem right we have to

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
do

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,240
the advocacy every you know it's a small

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,760
t small community

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,800
and we're doing everything just like a

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,360
startup so the the things we that we

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
learn

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,320
are huge um and then we have two

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,440
um fairly large uh usage

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,519
of this um from a sort of production

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,240
business point of view

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,560
and that of course is really where the

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,320
total value comes from

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,360
actually from solving problems

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,920
real problems um for real people

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,800
and so that's the final level of success

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,079
basically is

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,000
is when the technology is being useful

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,040
to somebody

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,399
um uh okay

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,399
so that was that one let's look at the

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,760
next one so why from the

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,079
from my point of view um two small

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,000
amounts of vacancies in open source

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,480
i'm not sure i'm following it why

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,160
why are there a small number of

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,800
vacancies in open source i'm not sure

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,279
that there

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,640
are maybe you have to give me a bit more

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,160
detail

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,959
um i mean there's two parts to it i mean

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,040
anybody can contribute to open source

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,120
the trick is getting paid for it um

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,519
and organ there are organizations that

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
that bet their business on open source

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,800
and those are the ones if you want to be

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,880
paid for doing open source those are the

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,079
companies to work for

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,880
um and and they will

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,519
value your contribution and your skills

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,760
that are

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,440
part of that open source process so i

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,519
think it's really

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
a question of choosing your company

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,800
wisely in terms of

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,839
who you want to work for the other thing

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,640
i also see

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,040
is larger companies wanting an open

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,320
source

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,079
project to be enhanced and they

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,000
may not for regulatory reasons be

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,959
allowed to actually contribute

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,240
and then that's an opportunity for uh

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,120
software

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,360
um companies and consultancy companies

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,360
who have skills in that project and have

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,480
maintainers in that project

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,519
um can pick up you know um

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
interesting contracts around it so yeah

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,639
i think as i say

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,600
there's plenty to do and i'm sure most

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,800
communities

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,639
will um encourage people to join

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,120
but if you have to still earn a living

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,040
then it's just really looking at

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,040
who's using open source and who's

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,000
actually wanting to be an active member

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,560
in that

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,959
in that in these in these types of

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
projects

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,720
i hope i answer the question

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
any more questions

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,560
okay so the next question is um if

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,600
people are new to open source and they

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,720
want to get involved

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,399
how can they um in any project and i

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,000
think specifically in our project

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,600
so firstly you need permission

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,279
so if you work for a company you need to

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,560
make sure that they they're okay with

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,839
you doing this

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,839
um even if you're

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,600
doing this in your spare time you do

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,360
have to be a little bit careful of

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
conflicts of interest so particularly if

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,519
you're in a software type business but

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
presuming you've got permission to do it

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,360
and you've got the time to do it

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,079
uh then really as you approach a

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,800
community

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,920
whether it's the nigeria community or

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,680
any other

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,959
is think you have to think about how do

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,040
i get them to trust me

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,279
how do i get them to trust me they've

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,560
worked very hard on this software

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:52,079
or that whatever whatever is the product

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,000
and um and i want them to give me right

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,680
access to all their work

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
which is ultimately what you get when

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,839
you become a committer or a maintainer

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,639
on a particular project

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,839
so the price that every community will

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
document

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,440
their process for joining in so just

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,120
being able to

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,480
to you know to be a part of it listen

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,839
talk to people

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,279
uh contribute ideas and then you can

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,320
also go a bit further and start

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,360
contributing

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,800
content to the project and again they

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,040
will have a series of

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,079
um of instructions on what you do

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,440
so for exeria if you go to our github

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,800
repository

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,480
uh you'll see the um

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,880
there's a thing called the community

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,600
guide that tells you how to connect into

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,399
into our group and then from there

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,079
there's

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,440
links to developer guides and um

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,120
how to become a contributor how to

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
become a maintainer

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,399
and all the different sort of procedures

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,399
and

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,519
and processes that you go through and

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,680
that's quite normal

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,000
for an open source project that's under

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,199
what's called open governance

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,079
and that's something that the linux

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,920
foundation does um very well

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,760
there are a lot of open source projects

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,519
in github that are really only one

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,240
person maintaining it

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,360
and so they you really got to connect

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,199
with them and if they want to

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,399
help you to help them then they'll let

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,000
you help them so

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,760
you need to look at the projects in

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
terms of how is it governed but if it's

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,240
like a lineus foundation

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,279
project then in the top of the github

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,440
repository

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,399
you will see all the instructions on how

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,399
to to connect

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
um right so that's that one the next one

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
is a great question

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,720
is leading an open source project

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,680
different easier and harder than leading

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,959
inside a big company

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,959
like ibm so that's both actually

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,279
um and so inside a company

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,639
you have a position and in that position

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,079
you have

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,639
um you have authority

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,079
and if you're responsible for building a

00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
product and delivering certain set of

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,040
functions

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,079
you have that authority to tell people

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,759
what to do

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,040
uh to organize the work uh you know and

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,519
make sure you've got the right people to

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,639
there so you have authority but

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,120
in an open source project then

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,880
people do what they want right they want

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,880
they invest their time

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,040
in the thing that's important either to

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,560
whoever's their company

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,680
or to um or to their own personal

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,519
interest

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,560
so what you're doing in terms of

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,360
leadership is allowing people

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,079
to do what they want while maintaining

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,240
the coherency of the whole

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,720
so the whole point the whole purpose

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,519
around it and then the way that you work

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,120
is much more collaborative things you

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,680
have to sometimes you have to relax and

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,199
let things happen in their own time

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,639
sometimes the project goes and does

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,839
something that you wouldn't have done

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:59,040
but but actually is the right thing

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,320
so it's it it's always engage brain

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,120
before mouth when you're

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,959
leading in this environment because you

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,079
can't make anybody do anything

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:11,280
um and so that's

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,360
it's it's more about the fact that um

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,039
it's it's a style thing it tests hate

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,480
patience sometimes

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,880
but it also um is the most wonderful

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,600
thing because you see things happening

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,439
that you you didn't direct you didn't

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,160
think of but the result is absolutely

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,039
fantastic

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,480
so in that sometimes i see amazing

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,840
things happening in the project

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,520
and i'm thinking well this is easy

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,200
because i didn't do anything about that

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,679
i didn't make that happen i didn't need

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,000
to because the community did it for me

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,720
and um you know we we have um sometimes

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
we have problems

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,080
you know our build machines fall over or

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,120
we get a problem

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,120
and and people just rally around so

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,799
in that respect because it's all willing

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,400
volunteers

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,440
it's easier as long as we're all wanting

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
to move into the same direction

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,799
sometimes there's a little bit of

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,480
negotiation that's required

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:06,880
so um it probably i think

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:10,000
it's very different and for some people

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,520
the um they much prefer to have it very

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,720
clear on what they have to deliver when

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,160
they have to deliver it and what

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,640
resources they have to deliver it

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,120
for which is more like working in a big

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,200
working insider company

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:26,720
than um a more collaborative style

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,440
for me personally i prefer the the open

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,799
source

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
uh approach um but it's the time when it

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,520
gets

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
um a little bit difficult is when i need

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,160
when the when the company i work for for

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,760
ibm needs

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,000
the open source project to do something

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,160
specifically by a certain date

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,240
and that that can that can be quite

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,679
quite uh quite fun

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,919
so um yeah so is it is it

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,720
yes is it easier harder i just think

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,960
it's different

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,280
and uh different people prefer different

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,080
styles

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,880
um so that's hopefully that's a good

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,320
enough answer

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,760
so next question is what do i love about

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,799
working in open source i think you can

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,720
probably tell

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,480
that i do love working in open source

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,120
and um

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,080
and it's been all my career i've worked

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
on

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,360
the next generation of technology so i

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,720
was i

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,039
started on mainframes and i

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,720
then moved to working on distributed

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,080
unix systems

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,160
and enabling transaction processing

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,760
software to work on those distributed

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,320
systems at a time

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,080
when people believed you needed to run

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,440
serious business applications

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,840
on a mainframe and that these

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,760
small distributed systems were really

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,200
never going to be

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,799
um uh strong enough to run a business on

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,640
which of course

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,799
as uh you know you look back on that you

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,160
think well that's just ridiculous

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,840
um and then after that um i started

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,760
working on open standards

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,840
and corpus standards and implementation

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,280
of that and again it was like well these

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,520
open standards won't work you need

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,280
proper you need that that

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,039
that the security of a proprietary

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,159
system um

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:12,080
and uh so and then i worked

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:15,200
um much more on um data oriented systems

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,520
and uh using metadata to control

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,679
the use and expansion of data so each

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,240
stage of my career has been

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,000
that next generation beyond the current

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,600
product today

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,480
and so one of the reasons i like about

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,039
open source is it allows

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,640
that stage of development to happen in a

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,120
very

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,320
effective way so we iterate we

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,000
collaborate

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,080
and we can deliver and explore new areas

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,919
um in a way that it's very difficult for

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,280
a product team that have to

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,280
basically earn and earn a living from it

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,360
and that's that to me is is the way that

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,039
that releases innovation to me is is it

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
is the most fantastic thing about open

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,360
source

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,200
oh next question that's a good one do

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,799
you have a lot going on any personal

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
tips for work-life balance actually no

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,840
i'm looking for them if anybody's got

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,280
any good ideas

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,520
one of the things i've found over the

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,880
last six months while we've been

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,240
working from home is how much effort i

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,480
have to make

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,960
to make sure i have time for myself and

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,600
and so i have one room where my laptops

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,679
are

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,520
and when i leave those rooms i am i've

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,880
left work so to speak

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,720
um but the one of the reasons why i find

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,200
it so difficult to come away is that the

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,480
whole project is so interesting

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,840
um that uh you know i i'm sort of

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,960
i want to want to keep working on it um

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,000
but um so for me my um

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,559
my leisure time is is i love hiking and

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,080
uh so if i can get out into the

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,200
countryside

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,720
and um you know sort of work while the

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,039
weather's good

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,559
that's that's how i that's how i get i

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,640
actually get away so i think having an

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,919
interest having something that

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,760
allows you to step away from the very

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,280
deep thinking that's required

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,440
to work on any of these open source

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,280
projects and that's that's the trick but

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,840
if anybody's got any better ideas please

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,840
let me know

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:27,840
any other questions

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,840
i think we've done them i don't think

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,840
i've missed just jabber checking

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:55,840
i've not missed anything out i think

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:55,840
i've got everybody's questions

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,000
okay well i think that's that's the end

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,520
of the session so thank you very much

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,400
everyone for your questions and i hope

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,400
