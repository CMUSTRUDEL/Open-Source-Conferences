so you can see what's being put in or

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,960
what you can maybe help

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,919
uh in the next release we also have a

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,800
bi-monthly

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,800
advocacy meeting

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,039
open embedded has a i believe it's a

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,520
monthly

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,360
happy hour they have a schedule for that

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,639
and i think there's a monthly

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,440
tsc meeting not i'm not entirely sure

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,840
the schedule

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
of that

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,000
all right some other outreach uh

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
is jacques uh we do have a twitch slash

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
yakuto

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,280
youtube put together that uh joseph has

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,120
been doing for

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,120
i'm guessing up to maybe almost two

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
years now

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
um there's some stats we have up to 5

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,919
subscribers 8 000 uh views per month

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,960
almost over 800 hours were watched

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,840
so uh that's

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
pretty cool i think

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,160
uh and also if you want to we have some

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,800
bottom

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400

uh we have a couple more uh rounded out

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,000
with the uh

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,120
first uh the octo project's first decade

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,240
with uh jeffrey and

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
nicolas uh posting that so that that'll

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,960
end on

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,960
um wednesday

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,800
we are also having a summit this year

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,720
it's at the end of the this week on

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,520
thursday and friday

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,199
it's not too late to register so there's

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,520
a link there you can register

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,160
uh and sign up for those two

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,120
sign up for the summit uh if you want to

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
look at the schedule i

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,319
included the schedule for the summit uh

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,759
there's effectively

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,759
two beginner sessions in parallel with

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:34,639
uh the 20 intermediate sessions and

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,599
there's also going to be a a hack room

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,599
with three hands on

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,080
and see and now this is where we turn

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
everything

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,840
over to the community to ask questions

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,639
okay so i've been monitoring the chat so

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,000
looks like

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,680
there are a few issues people can join

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,879
through the

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
event web interface or through zoom so i

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,520
think

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,919
i would recommend everyone to join on

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
zoom just to make sure

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
i think there is some sort of

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,560
integration between the application the

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,319
web application and zoom but

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,120
it looks like zoom works better for most

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,440
people so we are definitely on zoom

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,199
and uh yeah so let's if you have any

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,120
issues just try to

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,520
click on the chat button and join the

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
zoom link

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,759
so um yeah so that's

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,760
where it's difficult the first question

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,049
the first microphone that's always the

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,719
same um

00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,000
[Music]

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,080
yeah uh the rule is that try to i know

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,919
you should be able to unmute as well but

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,680
in general if there are many questions

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,120
maybe it's better to just ask the

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,040
questions

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,040
uh yes i can see that dave

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,440
you can ask the questions on chat and

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,320
then we'll try to answer the questions

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,800
or

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
ask anyone so i see that we have many

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,760
key people key developers from the

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,839
project we have reach out with us

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,839
so hopefully we can take any questions

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,600
today

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,600
so anyone wants to volunteer with her

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,640
so can you hear me yes

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
that works fine yes i would be

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,560
interested to know

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,880
how you guys are dealing with nfs route

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,120
in

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,680
yoktto so some other psp build system

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,240
like pt exists that i use they have

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,240
an nfs root mechanism that just extracts

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
a directory for you that's called root

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
where your root fs

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,399
is and it patches the permissions for

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
the files and folders

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,519
so i can just point and collect it and

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,360
use it

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
but with doctor what i have been using

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,000
so far is that i

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,560
extract a table and then if i run into

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,519
suit problems i have to fix them up

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,800
manually

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
so i wonder does anyone have already

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,839
script

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,800
that does it maybe with using i notifier

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,120
or something or

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,720
how do you guys do nfs route so this

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
would be something i would be interested

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,480
to hear

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,480
what you guys do

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,519
okay so i do not have the answer but

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,000
i'm hoping uh maybe somebody wants to

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
speak up

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
shall i see you're unmute but i don't

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,000
yeah i can if nobody else wants to go

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,600
um the project actually has

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
its own inbuilt nfs server so a user

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,760
space nfs server which runs under sudo

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,079
to handle the permissions

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,399
so um i can't remember the names of the

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,760
script off hand but there is some kind

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
if you look in the scripts directory

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,560
there's something involving nfs root in

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
there

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
and that allows you to take a root fs

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,880
tarball extract it

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,720
and then use it as an nfs

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,480
as an nfs server which you can then

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,600
point a given kernel and piece of

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,720
hardware at

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,160
so that technology should be there

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
it's probably not as well documented as

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,959
it should be but if you have a look in

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,800
that directory you should see some

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,959
scripts that

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
will let you do that and i'm i'm fairly

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,000
sure that it's actually

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,320
tested in one of the in the self tests

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,320
as well

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
okay so i can just rerun the build and

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
it will

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,200
automatically put the newest files at

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,399
the correct location

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,240
um that that's

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,519
that technology will let you host it and

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,600
get the permissions right and everything

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,959
else but you probably will have to extra

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
re-extract the root fs

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,560
after you finish the build i don't think

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
it dynamically updates in place at this

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,399
point

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,920
that's something which would be quite

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,399
nice to add but i don't think it

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,680
automatically does that at the moment

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,160
okay so i use it uh often uh

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,760
i use it a lot so that i can just

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,639
develop on some software

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,920
and just build in my vsp and so mute fs

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
is updated

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,760
it would be great to have this in your

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
tool

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,079
it should be as simple as adding some

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,079
kind of rsync or something like that

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,200
between the two directories run under

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,560
sudo

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,920
at the end of the image task or

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,639
something there's there's probably

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
options there

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,480
but like i said it's just not done quite

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,959
like that today

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,240
okay i'm not sure how well that would

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,079
work that you just

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,079
replaced too many files at once while

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,079
the kernel is running off it

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,760
but i'm not sure about the limitations

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,720
i'm just wondering if so it's something

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
i will try

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,440
that script you have mentioned and see

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,440
if that suffices

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,560
i've done that with my in-house boards

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,000
where i will uh upload onto an nfs

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,079
server and just have my

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,959
uh board uh automotive that

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,800
when you boot comes up so every time i

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,360
build i i i'm

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,120
sending up a new copy of the root file

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,200
system to my nfs server

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
and just do it that way i wrote a class

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,600
for it

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,360
it's in a meta lab

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,160
you can uh i haven't registered it on

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,160
the uh

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,600
layer index yet but uh

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,680
it's what i use for at home if you have

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
a different okay

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,480
so i it it's kind of it's kind of a

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,880
crude way of doing it but it's way

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
around it

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,160
i can

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
probably share i should probably

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,120
register it so people can use

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,120
play around with it

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,240
i'm more generally what i mean if you

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,160
need to i mean we'll try to take

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
questions and answers today if you need

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,040
to follow up and if you talk if we

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,320
talked about something at the buff and

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,320
you want to follow up

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,079
uh there are many ways i mean the

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
octoproject mailing list would probably

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,880
be something now that you've talked

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
about this thing you can send an email

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,600
and hopefully

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,199
you know others can follow up on the

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,600
mailing list

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,600
and then during the conference uh most

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,480
of the people and most of the project

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
developers we've decided to use a slack

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,399
instance

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,279
so if you go on the october on the elc

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,839
main page

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,880
you will find a link to her to join the

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,320
conference channel

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,760
that we decided to use all week

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,199
so you can find us there and ask

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,079
questions more questions or need to

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,079
follow up on anything

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,279
uh can i go to voice nicole yes

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,639
well done thanks uh i just

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,279
uh arrived literally on the slide

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,320
after armin misspelled my name so i've

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,279
been told you owe me a beer

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,120
but anyways uh most serious notes um

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
we've had some discussions on localized

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,399
content

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,880
like german italian chinese india

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,519
things like that so it would be awesome

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,040
if we can

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,880
could get some input by our user base

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
if there is a need for that what are the

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,279
formats that are

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,000
most uh interesting for the specific

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,240
regions

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,079
for example i've been told that india

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,760
almost has no use for written

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,040
documentation it's all videos that they

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,360
consume

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,040
on the other hand in scandinavia it

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
seems to be only written documentation

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
so

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,240
uh where should we be heading that would

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,240
be really interesting for us

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,680
yeah so what joseph just mentioned it's

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,920
a discussion that the

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,199
yorkto advocacy team is having these

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,199
days i think it started a few weeks ago

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,480
what we realize is we have a few people

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,320
who actually produce

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,160
content in like i mean italian

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,759
japanese i mean we have different

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,920
languages and that's something

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
the project itself i mean we've not done

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,000
i mean the the documentation and

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,000
everything we write is mostly in english

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,600
but we are looking at how we can

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,639
actually explore and how the community

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
can actually grow

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,759
uh and just produce languages

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,920
i mean differently i mean materials

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,199
documentation into different languages

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,360
i think joseph you said that you are

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,839
ready to do that in german which is good

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
and uh but yeah so if we find more

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,639
people that wants to help with different

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,399
languages and

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,160
then the next question is what kind of

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,720
content we need to create for

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,000
different languages so that's mostly a

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,360
question for

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,040
non-english speakers if you want to

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,320
explain to us i mean what you think

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,759
would be useful for developers around

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,959
you in your own country that would

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:37,839
actually be a very nice input for us

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:37,839
anybody wants to take a peek

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
okay it seems we're scared everybody

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,120
oh maybe we should ask the question in

00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,240
different languages maybe

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,240
maybe so there is a comment from

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,880
leon

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
yeah so i mean like we talked about

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,640
translating the whole documentation in

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,439
various languages that would be

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,520
way too much work uh but the idea would

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,559
be to create content that i mean

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,039
trainings or things that can help

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,760
i mean spread the dr project in various

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,760
countries

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,280
and in the end i mean yes i mean the

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,720
whole documentation it would be very

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,839
difficult to get that in

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,839
anything else in english

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,320
yeah um one has to say that this should

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,880
probably

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,880
more serve as entry-level documentation

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,760
or entry-level material to get

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,120
people up to speed because um if if we

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,679
would really translate

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,280
the higher level documentation it would

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,240
it would just be

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,600
like um ambiguous in the end the one

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
refers to the german one

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,039
another one refers to the english one

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
and uh

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,480
that that's probably not really good if

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
we have

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,600
when it really comes to the to the to

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,520
the core material

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,120
having stuff in english is the one

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,559
single source of truth and that

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,880
that should not be uh discussed actually

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,679
i'm really talking about stuff that that

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,799
gets

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,880
newcomers in how we get

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,320
people interested that are not like

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,320
starting out with a mega manual

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
okay anyway the key thing here is to let

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,559
everybody know that this is a topic

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,280
that we are concerned about and uh

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,320
if you take that further with your

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,280
friends colleagues

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,559
and want to get back to jose for myself

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,600
and if you have any

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,200
specific need in any specific languages

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,880
joseph myself would like to make some

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,559
progress there so and again i mean it's

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
something that we

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,600
if someone steps up and wants to help

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,760
that we will

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,120
help them but it's not something we will

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,280
be able to do ourselves

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,360
obviously so if you need anything if you

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,080
want to get back to us or talk about

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,120
that

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:11,039
yeah just find joseph or find me

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:13,520
great thanks

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,559
yeah i agree with your comment leon uh

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,559
some conferences

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,000
are more local than others and that

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,840
would be here so then we will need

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,440
speakers at these conferences

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:29,520
obviously definitely

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,559
okay so maybe while we wait uh for the

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,799
next question um i mean

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,760
talked about the yocto summit and in the

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,880
introduction so

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,440
it's uh it's a big event for us uh we

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,440
had

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,640
close to 200 people last time just

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,200
joining us for like

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,760
one day uh this time we do a two-day

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,480
event

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,520
uh with many different i mean a few

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,520
different tracks

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,120
including trainings for beginners people

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,720
who want to learn

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,480
about the project and get started with

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,200
the projects we definitely really hope

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,520
that this

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,320
is going to be a a good and successful

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,360
event

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,799
it's on thursday and friday this week

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,960
after this conference and it's still uh

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,880
possible to join so if you want to join

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,840
or if you have any specific issues

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,760
you can find me or david david who is

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,840
also organizing the event

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,840
and we will help you and guide you for

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
that

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,840
do we know how many people are signed up

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,840
for the summit

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,840
so far

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,679
i think it was a week ago and it was

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,679
more than 50.

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,840
but i'm not sure i mean i just give a

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
number but i'm not even sure

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,960
okay so again uh still hopefully we'll

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,600
get more questions

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,559
uh since we have uh sorry to put you on

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,760
the spot richard

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,880
uh it's almost a new release

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,039
3.2 do you want to talk about

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,960
what's coming in 3.2 and hopefully that

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,320
will

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,159
make people ask more questions

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,200
that's that's a good question um it

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,840
depends what people are going to

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
contribute

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,919
to be perfectly honest oh 3.2 is way too

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,919
late to contribute

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,280
oh sorry right right right i thought you

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,120
were talking about three three

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,240
um yeah three three two um

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
well as you said i mean one of the

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,760
biggest things is the documentation

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,960
transition over to sphinx

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,760
um i kind of see 32 is a bit of a

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,200
more of a stabilization um but we are we

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,799
have managed to update a lot of the

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,799
recipes to be

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,559
probably as close to upstream as we've

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,600
we've been in any of our releases which

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,840
i think is good

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,960
our patch overhead and sort of uh you

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,280
know the number of patches we're

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,039
carrying to various bits of software is

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,840
slowly shrinking over time which i think

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,600
is very positive

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,960
um there's a lot of sort of smaller

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,799
changes in there

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,559
and such as the pseudo fixes which i

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,440
think are going to really help with some

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,760
of the

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,679
um the rare but important sort of um

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,440
corruption cases and so on that we've

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,159
noticed and we need to fix

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,200
so yeah it's uh in case people are

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,039
wondering 3.2 we did have the rc1 build

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,799
which has just come out of qa

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,559
unfortunately one of the patches that i

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,640
i broke one of my rules and took a

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,760
patch at the last minute it's broken

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
things so we're probably going to have

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,799
an rc2

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,320
that will go into qa and then hopefully

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,720
we might get the release out by the end

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,320
of the week we'll see

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,480
but that just gives people an idea of

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,080
what's going on with the release

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,760
was there anything specific you wanted

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,760
to talk about niko

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,120
no no just i mean i think it's good for

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
me

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,559
most of the core people know what's

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,159
going on but i think we we have more

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,120
people here today so

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,159
it's good to know so 3.2 is coming and

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:09,840
as expected

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:09,840
and that's good news

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,919
well uh shall i say something again

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,919
as you said the crowd is too shy

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,760
go ahead okay so uh one topic we had

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,120
last year in lyon

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:31,120
was um the question if

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:34,480
we are uh we are doing good on diversity

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,200
so if we are still all uh white angry

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,720
metal heads in our 30s or some in our

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,080
40s

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,120
by now or if we are like

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,320
how we can get people from from

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,440
other backgrounds in and

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:55,279
how are we doing there uh is is there

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,279
some pro progress on it um

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,880
yeah what's what's the feedback i i know

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,039
that some people

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,720
got in touch with that over outreachy

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,640
and

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,000
at least for for tim and me i can uh

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,400
i can say we we are trying as far as

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,600
as much as we can to to help those and

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,720
um

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,559
yeah get them up to speed but yeah

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,799
are there others who feel like they need

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,840
some assistance or

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:28,400
yeah please step up and uh let us know

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,679
so i mean i think it's a very important

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,360
thing that you describe

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,919
and it's definitely an issue for

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,440
me this community and i encourage

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,520
everyone to attend

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,240
the event on wednesday about the 10

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,240
years anniversary of the project

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,159
and yeah you might realize that this is

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,760
not that this is an issue for the

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,919
project when you see i mean the pictures

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,279
and the people who have contributed

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,480
so and we are in a very special place

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,559
in the embedded limits space itself uh

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,039
so we've tried in the past uh to do

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
things

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,320
and we've worked in the past with for

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,880
example the outreachy

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,720
organization that makes like uh i mean

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,159
internships to try to reach out to

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,000
people who usually i mean

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,840
it might be actually difficult to reach

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,760
out to

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,640
what we are trying and again i mean it

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,159
takes a lot of energy from people from

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,840
this community to actually go and

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,440
and and do these things and i'm very

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,840
happy that this year

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,520
uh we have been able to propose two

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,440
different internships

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,279
to the outreach so there are i mean

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,000
actually this is october so

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,240
by the end of this week uh we will do uh

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,840
we will close the selections of interns

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,960
for two different topics for the octa

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,000
project

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,840
so it's only possible because we have

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,440
people in our community you just step up

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,039
and just want to do that

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,880
and there is a bit of finance side of

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,880
things but that's

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
usually easier to get the finance side

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,600
of things and actually

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,440
i mean find people who really want to

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,360
step up so

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,039
we definitely what we've seen that i

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,559
mean as soon as we open up the outreach

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,200
like a few weeks ago we've seen

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,640
i mean a few new um and new people

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,039
joining

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,919
and with different background and uh

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,440
they just

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,960
were very interested what actually start

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,000
learning about the project

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,840
so we already saw some positive

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,360
things about that and we really hope to

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,159
get more uh

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,000
we will uh support and we will help uh

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,520
anyone who in our community wants to

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,360
help us with this kind of issues

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,279
yeah so you know trevor warner has been

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,600
trying to get google summer of code

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,279
going and you know we just haven't quite

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,559
gotten there yet i was really glad to

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,640
see us get the two

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:42,559
um outreachy internships in there

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,400
you know it's always hard to get uh

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,159
connected with the right people and the

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
communication and the whole process of

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,480
onboarding

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,039
the applicants is tricky

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,760
but it's still just very exciting right

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,159
and

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,480
you know many of you realize i i taught

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,000
in university for five years and

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,520
if you count all the time i was in grad

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,799
school it's way more than that that i

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,559
was teaching

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,080
so it's a very natural for me to be a

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,799
mentor and

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,640
and i love doing it so you know i'm i'm

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,120
putting my money where where my mouth is

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,520
or

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,000
you know walking the walk in that regard

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,399
the best i can

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,760
yeah thanks for that and i mean even

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,840
though i mean

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,520
the octo i mean looks like something

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
which is deeply embedded uh it's

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,480
actually fairly straightforward to get

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,960
started for anyone

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,240
uh like when we talk to interns that and

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,480
for the outreach we

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,080
let them know that they don't even need

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,679
like a super powerful machine

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,080
we can provide all the hardware for that

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
we can provide them in cloud instances

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,640
and we can help

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,200
anyone i mean who sometimes that might

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,919
be i mean like a barrier to entry

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,720
so we will do anything we can to help uh

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,600
again uh

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,039
just try to reach out to more more

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,039
people than what we have today

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,279
but i i think it's important to sort of

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,520
stress that this all comes down to

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,960
community support of these initiatives

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,120
because we have tried to get these going

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,520
we are short on mentors

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,399
and there's a tangential topic which is

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,039
the

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,640
inclusive language and i think that the

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,399
next release is going to see

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,840
we're going to need to make some changes

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,399
and those changes are going to be

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,000
relatively disruptive because we do have

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,919
terminology in there that you know

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,159
shouldn't really be in there

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,440
um but we have put some proposals out

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,960
about how we should go about that and

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,840
put a road map there

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,919
um everybody i think is in you know is

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,520
in agreement we need to go and fix this

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,080
but actually people stepping up to do

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,760
the work

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,480
has turned out to be a little bit tricky

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,159
so far now i have deferred it to 3-3

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,640
because it was getting too late in 3-2

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,960
to take

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,559
invasive changes like that we do need to

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,760
address it in 3-3 but we

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,320
are going to need help um and i'm hoping

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,960
some of the people here um you know yes

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,960
as the

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,559
the people the contributors we all know

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,159
but i'm also hoping we may get some new

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,399
contributors who can help us with

00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,320
uh with some of this uh work yeah that's

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,760
right in fact there are even changes

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,760
that can be done by

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,120
i mean people who are not very familiar

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,159
with the project i mean especially with

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,520
the inclusive language

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,760
i mean there are technical change which

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,039
changes we want to make there are things

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,360
to review i mean help with the

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,799
documentation and so

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,240
i mean you don't need to know everything

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,000
about the project to get started with

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,679
that so that might actually be a good

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,679
way to just get started with us

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,640
yeah and there's there's examples like

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,320
you know toaster and the layer index and

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,679
things like that that are in django

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,720
right and that's a completely different

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,720
skill set

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,399
completely different group of people

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,279
that would would likely be interested in

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,559
working on that

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,880
and that's very different than the

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,559
normal core folks

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,559
in our traditional usage

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,440
it's worth highlighting as well that the

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,440
documentation transition over to sphinx

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,679
does mean that the documentation is now

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,559
much more accessible

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,480
for people to make changes to because

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,039
the doc book syntax was

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,960
pretty horrible to try and work with the

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,200
manuals are much easier to

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,200
to read and to make changes to and and

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,000
to review as well to be honest

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,520
so i think this there are sections of

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,159
the manuals that are dating

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,159
um and need improvement or there's just

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,799
things that are undocumented and so on

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,640
um but i think you know that's another

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,159
area where new contributors can

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,399
very easily make a big difference in the

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,080
project as well yeah you know richard i

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,399
think that's like a very strong point

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,799
and

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,960
once again thanks to nico for such a

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,399
heavy lift on that but um

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,679
you know i i was reading through

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,120
something in the manual just the other

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,640
day and realized

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,760
oh there's a link missing here and

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,120
you know the the barrier so i was very

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,399
comfortable with doc book that wasn't

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,960
really the problem but

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,240
to actually build it and test it was

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,399
non-trivial

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,240
so the barrier to actually make changes

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,799
is very low it's it's about the same as

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,799
just making a change to some recipe now

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,159
it's really really nice much different

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,440
situation

00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,600
i think that's one of the best things we

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,000
did this year

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,840
yeah that's correct the change and and

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,200
that's that's right i mean the

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,960
building and rebuilding the whole

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,880
documentation and locally testing

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,039
the documentation is now just become

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,399
like a one-liner and it just takes like

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,159
a minute

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:19,440
so that's that's a very big change yes

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,559
we just need a recipe now to kill that

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,679
new image

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,840
you could build that for speed bake yes

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,919
okay so while we i mean the thing that

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,200
we are waiting happened so we have a few

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,679
questions now

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,279
um so there was a question earlier so

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,039
somebody i'm just going to

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,039
quickly repeat the question another

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,360
sentence so many work

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,960
uh watch chris talk about combining octo

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,559
and debian the big difference

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,799
is in developer experience for

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,159
application application developers

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,399
having a binary package feed so

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,240
where are we with the octo in terms of

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,640
consistent experience for package fees

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,159
for

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,159
creating this straw

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:07,360
so i just uh used what we have now

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,399
this week in in my own development cycle

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,919
uh based on a talk that stefano

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,519
chitola did back in 2018 at a yacht

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,039
project dev day

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,399
so the problem is that what people mean

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,200
when they say package feed

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,120
isn't hey can you use that because we've

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,960
had that forever right we've had

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,720
the ability to put a package manager in

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
and build your own package feed and use

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,519
that

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,000
the problem is having a publicly

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,200
available package feed

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,960
and there's a lot behind that you know

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,399
there's

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,159
all the maintenance of it but there's

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,399
also liability once you start

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,399
actually producing binaries and making

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,720
them publicly available so it's just not

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,840
a

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,840
not a simple solution

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,600
but people are definitely working on

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,919
that

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,120
i i think that you know in the past it

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,039
would have been very difficult to do

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,279
something like a binary package feed

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,760
um you know we've seen distros produce

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,760
them we went through phases where

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,679
there were challenges in that i think

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,880
the situation has improved

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,720
particularly now we have hash

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,519
equivalents we have reproducible builds

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,039
and so on

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,960
um i think that will help tremendously

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,720
with things like the auto increment dpr

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,320
values and things like that

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,880
so i think it's probably

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,640
a time when somebody could you probably

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,519
need a team of people to do it this is a

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,039
challenge

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,120
so if there is a group of people you

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,720
know fellow co-travelers who would be

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,279
interested in doing that and can

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,279
define the parameters of that binary

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,399
feed then i think that the time is right

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,159
to do it

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,080
but it's going to need people to step up

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,519
and do it because the current sort of

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
contributors working on the core of the

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,399
project

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,840
don't have the bandwidth for that so

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,919
it's a step beyond what we have today

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,240
um i think the the technology is there

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,919
now

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,000
it's just going to the people to drive

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,000
it

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,960
this is this is walt i was the one who

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,039
typed in the question

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,079
um just to be clear i'm talking about a

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,200
package feed not

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,000
of the yakdo project packages themselves

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,599
but

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,200
now that i once i've built my

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,399
distribution

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,079
based on yakito project

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,079
the downstream feed from there

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,079
so are you talking about hosting your

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,200
own

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,839
like having a agl host their own yeah so

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,280
agl

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,119
agl wants to have a package fee based on

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,639
a linux just based on a yakito

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,119
distribution and does

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,560
like i think i think richard just said

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,000
there's a lot there's work that needs to

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,919
be done and somebody needs to step up

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,520
and do it i was just wondering

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,000
if there's any um any anything more in

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,240
flight

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,079
from uh from yakuto with the actual

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,680
project itself

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,560
we've been talking about it but you know

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,400
what you're talking about for agl

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,480
is absolutely doable right because

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,359
you've already got a ci infrastructure

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,079
so

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,599
essentially once you've done your build

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,200
you would need to run the

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,839
package index task and then

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,240
basically run you know rsync to rsync

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,480
that

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,200
um your you know deploy

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,480
ipk or deploy rpm or whatever package

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,079
manager you're using

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,520
directory to your web server

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,240
that would the thing that's actually

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,480
going to serve up the package feed

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,359
so i just did that a couple days ago so

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,359
we can talk about this

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,640
offline or whatever but yeah that would

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,720
be yeah

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,839
we should have john simon says he's he's

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,200
having trouble joining

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,040
but um yeah it would be a good

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,640
discussion to have with uh with john

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,960
simon as well

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,079
yeah i mean i i i'm happy to go over

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,680
that with you guys in

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,520
in some detail because i just did it

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,280
again okay for the first time in a while

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,280
it's really easy to get that first

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,079
package feed it's maintaining it where i

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,359
think there's

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,359
a little bit of um

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,880
exploration that's going to be needed

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,640
and i think but i think the tools are

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,520
all there i know people like mark hatley

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,400
did try this

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,240
um integrating cash equivalents and pr

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,320
service and things like that

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,280
it's not entirely perfect but it's not

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,160
far off either

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,000
um i don't see huge issues particularly

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,359
now we've got the reproducibility pieces

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,280
and the hash equivalents

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,640
which means that this defeat stability

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,839
is there you're not having everything

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,400
change every you know

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,359
every time you rebuild or anything so

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,640
it's close

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,880
it just needs somebody to actually go

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,720
and try it and have a little bit of time

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,000
to fix the inevitable uh bugs that

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,240
you're gonna get when you try something

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,240
new

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,760
yeah and it's something like you know in

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,839
the fedora project you've got the the

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,240
nightly compose that has to happen which

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,720
takes

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,240
you know all the builds that come out of

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,560
koji and puts it into

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,440
the various spins and images and so on

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,680
and

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,160
that extras those extra steps that

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,280
make the thing consistently and robustly

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,240
and reliably

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,960
uh up upgradable and downloadable that

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,000
those are the extra steps that

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,720
we haven't as a community been doing

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,920
because we don't have that

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,240
infrastructure

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
so those are some of the places where

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,240
agl would probably

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,599
find some stumbling blocks but it's not

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,200
insurmountable

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,880
and the the infrastructure sorry the

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,920
code

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,320
the metadata the the tools are

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,920
much better off than they have been in

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,000
in a long time in what

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,400
in my recollection they're very stable

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,400
right now

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,480
okay and i would give a mention you

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,400
asked about new features in this release

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,560
that's interaction between hash

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,079
equivalence and pr service is something

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,359
that was fixed by mark hartley in the

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,680
release

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,119
so that's something new in 3-2 that will

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,599
definitely help with this

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,640
because it was being used definitely for

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,359
what you've just described

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,000
basically yeah the problem for us then

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,800
is that

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,920
we've chosen to stick with the lts

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,920
release so

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,640
we need to think about how how we can

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,640
make use of that

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,599
right and the changes were fairly

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,880
invasive from what i remember so we

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,640
yeah but it's something we should we

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,480
definitely need to look into and figure

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,480
out whether there is a

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,079
um you know an extra layer on top or

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,040
something that this could be done in or

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,640
whether the changes

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,160
because they've stabilized in master

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,760
would become suitable or

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,839
what our general plan is going to be for

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,839
that kind of thing right

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,240
okay so that was another question

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,280
earlier and i'm just trying to

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,839
look at the backlog um is there any

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,720
anything that blocks lib cepcon to

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,800
actually

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,160
merge into oe core now that the placido

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,160
issue has have been fixed

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,320
which are that might again be for you

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,720
um the pseudo issue was fixed by just

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,599
aborting and not running anything to do

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,040
with setcomp

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,599
we just disable it so i think they're

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,440
tangential issues i'm not sure why we

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,839
right what we'd be needing to import

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,839
that for

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
uh cam already uh answered that so

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,520
there's a

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,880
discussion on that patch ongoing someone

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,119
okay

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,200
okay i'm sorry and it would be

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,440
interesting for systemd because the

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,599
systemd is called filtering depends on

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,599
that

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,720
okay so trying to move to the next

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,880
question um

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,720
someone is asking bill is asking about

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,400
rpm this is rpkg

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,280
vstab is reporting that deb is probably

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,760
less used

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,320
but he wanted to get a feeling about how

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,200
people use rpms so pkg and report that

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,720
phd might actually need a bit of help

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,440
so the the main project is mostly using

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,400
our

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,359
dnf and rpm packaging so those are

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,800
that's the most

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,560
tested ipk and opk or o package are

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,599
tested quite a bit as well

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,119
debian's just currently the least tested

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,920
and

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,960
we really just need peace people that

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,200
are using it

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,400
and want to use it to be involved and

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,520
help us

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,800
maintain it um you know it's it

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,280
we we definitely have limited

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,880
numbers of people involved in fixing

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,560
things right and so people that want to

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,119
use something else

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,319
we just really need you to you know come

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,319
join us and get involved

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,079
i would say i've never had any issues

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,760
with either rpm or

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,319
very packaged certainly within the last

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,319
few years

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,079
so those are the two i would recommend

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,079
people use

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,880
i think the question was whether there's

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,880
a percentage and i don't think any of us

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,960
have a percentage as to what split is i

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,119
know both of those are used

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,319
we've got at least two open bugs against

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,680
the debian back end for missing

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,359
functionality

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,960
um and we're struggling to find people

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,800
to add it because we don't seem to have

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,319
the user base there

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
but what the percentage is between the

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,520
two i don't know i

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,599
it this is one of the problems with open

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,040
source you can't tell exactly who your

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,000
users are you can just go buy bug

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,400
reports

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,839
and we know that our package and rpm are

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,839
both used

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,839
okay so there is a question uh about the

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
industrial grade linux

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,599
asking an apertus so i'm assuming this

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,440
is a follow-up

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,200
based on the earlier keynote or

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,000
presentation has there been any

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,680
discussion

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,200
at the with the lf about that because it

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,280
looks like

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,880
that yakuto could actually solve that

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,680
much better

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:05,280
so i guess it's a very open question

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:17,839
anybody is aware i don't think they're

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:20,079
spinning discussion but i could be wrong

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,440
which are aware of any discussion with

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,560
the industry

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,920
i'm i'm not aware of any specific

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,400
discussion on that topic

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,359
um i i know some of the people involved

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,079
are aware of

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,280
project so you would hope that you know

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,640
it would be something that's been

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,319
considered in that space

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,079
it's pro if people are if anybody is

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,200
involved with that you know talk to me

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,599
and um yeah we should at least try and

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,880
figure

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,400
out a way of connecting to that

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,800
community to make sure that we're at

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,920
least being considered

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,440
but yeah it's a good question i'm not

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,440
aware of any discussions right now

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,119
okay just looking at the time uh i think

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,599
we have five more minutes

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,359
um just trying to find if there are no

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,119
questions

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,760
so there are a bunch of discussion about

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,839
topic age uh opec address is rpm and i

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,839
don't see much questions

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,760
i don't see any other questions

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,760
hopefully i'm not missing anything

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,400
okay so one last one last all last two

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,400
questions

00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,839
maybe

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,640
lts status maybe we could should we talk

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,119
about that

00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,119
it's been

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,079
six months now maybe that we've launched

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,280
and talked a lot about

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,560
uh lts lts has been a

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,200
a key request uh to the project project

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,000
members

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,000
quite some time and the project was very

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,160
happy to announce that it managed to

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
figure out how to deal with lts and do

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,319
lts

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,599
so as anybody using lts has

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,520
lts changed the way you use or rely on

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,319
the octoproject do you have any feedback

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,720
on

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,760
what we could do better or differently

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,920
so i'll say

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,359
internally that um it was much easier to

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,119
convince

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,560
all the teams working on different

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,760
platforms

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,599
to switch to lts

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,520
but then that was like an easier sell

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,599
than we've ever had for getting a team

00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,400
to upgrade to a newer yaktor project

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,920
version so

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,920
i hope that's happening everywhere

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,839
i have heard that from a few places as

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,240
well

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,599
um that's definitely i mean one of the

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,680
hope that we had

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,680
reducing the number of key releases that

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,599
people rely on just like by having

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,200
one big lts i mean of course we still

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,599
want people encourage

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,359
people to use the latest release but

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,040
generally these people should be able to

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,560
grade more often than the others so

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,839
hopefully they should be able to keep up

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,839
with the pace of the release

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,400
starting up a new project and it's

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,520
literally

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,319
helped adoption without having having

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,319
lts there

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,560
one thing i'll say is that if people are

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,560
finding the lts useful

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,640
please do give us the feedback if you

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,400
can to show who's using it

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,079
why it's important because the project

00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,599
needs to be able to fund these things

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,119
and to show to be able to fund them we

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,800
need to show that they're actually being

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,480
used and they're useful to people

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,720
so it's kind of like we can end up in a

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,240
catch 22 situation where

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,400
everybody's really liking it but it's

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,560
working well and everybody stays silent

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,560
so if you can give us feedback and show

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,640
us that these things are being used

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,240
that does help us in you know then

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,440
figuring out to be able to try and fund

00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,359
them and keep them going

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,960
so i just want to make sure people are

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,280
aware of that as well that there is a

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,880
connection there showing that these

00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,520
things are being used is important to

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,160
help us

00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,160
make sure that they keep going because

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,839
obviously the members talk to each other

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,640
about it

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:43,839
but if we don't hear it from other users

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,839
in the field then we really don't know

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:57,839
there was a question about the length of

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,839
the lts policy it's two years right now

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,119
so what's the no that was the question

00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,960
right that's the length yeah so the

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,560
length is

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,800
two years again i mean everybody should

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,880
realize that there is there are finance

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,480
things associated with lts when it's

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,920
more work and it's dedicated

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,440
uh engineering work so at the moment

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,280
we have secured the funding to do one

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,920
lts which means that when we start the

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,079
next one

00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,680
after two years we will have to decide i

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,800
mean i mean we won't be able to do two

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,599
ats

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,440
the hope is that we see i mean we assess

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,920
the situation when it's time to get

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,040
there

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,680
and if lts is a success and

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,480
if more members from the project want

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,240
more

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,319
funding to go to the lts we might be

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,920
able to do two lts simultaneously which

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,839
means we can extend the first one but

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,079
this is all things that we

00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,079
we defeat for later so we wanted to put

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,920
the process a good process for lts

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,920
and then i mean we'll see i mean what

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,880
the feedback is and and how to deal with

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,119
the next lts

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,359
but two years is what we set for the

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,359
goal

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:21,599
feedback pitch you ask for feedback

00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,599
mailing list or just talk to paycheck

00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,960
should be able to just relay the

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,440
feedback um

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,960
but something yeah something on the

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,720
mailing list or sort of

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,160
if it's a if it's sent to one of us an

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,599
email or something like that we just

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,200
need to be able to show that there are

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,319
people using it and how

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,000
um that really does help us so yeah

00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,520
anyway we can show the support we also

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,839
put a page on the wiki

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,760
trying to show which projects are using

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,359
the yucta project and i think

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,400
adding something about lts support in

00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,400
there could also be good

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,680
but yeah any way we can show where the

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,240
project's being used and why it's

00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:03,440
important

00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:07,520
really does help us immensely

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:10,480
okay and i think this is it

00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,880
uh so this is the end of the buff and

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,240
again

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,200
there are many ways for everyone to just

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,119
join and talk to any of us uh the slack

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,720
channel the irc the mailing list yocto

00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,480
project slash community and you will

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,040
find all the details join us

00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,000
and there are a few presentations during

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,839
the week this week

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,359
at the event and there is a doctor

which is a dedicated event

00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,480
to the octo project and open embedded so

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,599
thanks

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,079
