	00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,599
hello everybody

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,199
good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,600
wherever you are joining us from

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,439
i'm tracy miranda i'm the executive

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,320
director of the continuous delivery

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,320
foundation

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
and i'll be on hand for the next 20

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,840
minutes to answer any questions you

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,439
might have

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,559
about cicd or devops

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,120
or anything i'm coming to you

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,040
from ottawa canada where it has

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,079
incredibly just started snowing

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,040
so i make that 169 days we've had

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
without snow

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,079
so to distract me from the cold weather

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,920
uh please keep your questions coming in

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,920
and i'll be happy to answer those

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,840
so if you aren't familiar with the

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,320
platform we have a q a

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,879
tab over to the right by the chat

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,840
and you can go ahead and drop any

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,880
questions inside there

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
and while you are doing that i want to

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,880
highlight

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,880
some news i've just seen today

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,680
so there's a new um open source job

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,400
report that

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,080
came out and um this is talking about

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
you know what hiring managers are

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
looking for and one of the key things

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
that that report pointed out

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
is that there's been a huge spike in

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
demand

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
for devops job so from all the different

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,920
areas

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,079
people are definitely looking for folks

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
who have experience with devops tools

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,920
and practices

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680
so that's certainly consistent with what

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
we're seeing at the continuous delivery

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,479
foundation

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,360
that there's a really high demand

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,399
there's a much much greater appreciation

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
that

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
delivering software has become a huge

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,159
differentiator

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,119
for any sort of company whether you're a

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
bank

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,239
or a retail business or a software

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,120
company

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,360
it doesn't make a difference you need to

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
now differentiate through software

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,440
and the folks who can make this happen

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,000
who can deliver software effectively

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
are the devops folks so yeah not

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,400
surprised

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,080
it's an amazing area to be in and

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,080
further than that the the report goes on

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,800
to say that

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,560
uh open source jobs like folks who have

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,599
experience with open source this

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,160
is actually a dearth of them so a huge

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,360
demand

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,959
for people who are um who have the open

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,519
source skill to get engaged with

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,519
projects

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,840
okay so i'm just gonna

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,480
okay so what i'm gonna do um is just

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,319
talk a little bit about the continuous

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,680
delivery foundation

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,959
and what our role is in

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,519
the whole kind of devops ecosystem

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,040
so the continuous delivery foundation is

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,080
an open source foundation

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,480
and it's the home to some of the you

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,440
know most popular and fastest growing

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,440
projects uh for continuous delivery so

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,519
many people have heard of jenkins

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,040
uh there's jenkins and spinnaker those

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,879
are two projects very

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,480
widely adopted for ci and cd

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,400
and then you have the projects which are

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,159
newer in the space tackling problems

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,120
around cloud native

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,120
so this is uh techton and jenkins x

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,680
okay i'm i'm gonna interrupt so we have

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,560
a question

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:57,200
uh which i will answer live and it says

00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:00,560
what defines devops as a job spec

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,200
okay so um i think

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
for when we talk about devops jobs uh i

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,480
think there's definitely

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,159
different camps of how people see this

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,760
so there's often controversy

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,640
around this because um when we think

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
about the

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
original definition of how devops came

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,400
to be

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,759
it it was all about breaking down silos

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,919
between

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
the dev side of the house who uh you

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,360
know traditionally perceived as tossing

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,840
the code over to the ops and then the

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,040
ops

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,040
um who would then deliver that

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,360
so if you think about devops as a

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,080
culture then perhaps you know devops as

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,120
a job spec

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,400
doesn't make a lot of sense uh

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,000
nevertheless um i think over time the

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,199
term devops has

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,919
evolved and you know

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,639
correctly or incorrectly it it stands to

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,000
represent

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,800
um that whole set of practices

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,440
which kind of evolve from the upside but

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
relate

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,479
to to all the tools there so

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
um depending on your perspective um some

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,639
people will take

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,120
a kind of more pure idea of devops where

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,039
the devops team is actually the team who

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,320
are in place to help

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,479
um the dev folks uh

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
you know integrate with ops and kind of

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,320
be those bridge builders

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,840
where others take a more simplified view

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,960
where devops tends to be

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,880
kind of this umbrella for um

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
you know how to use tools whether it's

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,840
you know jenkins

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,120
or spinnaker or terraform so we see that

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,320
term devops used in both those ways um

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,800
in particular like i

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,400
don't want to get caught up in in too

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,160
much like which one is right or which

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
one is wrong i think it's

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,320
useful if many people use it in a common

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,360
way to to use it that way

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,039
so i think devops is just focused on the

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,240
delivery of software

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,919
and a role where you you want to break

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,039
down barriers and work with the tools to

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,039
get the software delivered

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,680
so yeah i think depending on

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
where you go you might see different

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,840
definitions

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,520
from everything from ops tooling to a

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
more higher level

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,800
interestingly enough we're chatting with

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,479
some folks

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,919
at the continuous delivery foundation we

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,400
have a working group focused

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,080
around interoperability and we also have

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,080
conversations there about

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,960
being better about defining things so we

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,440
can avoid some of this confusion

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,400
and one interesting trend um that's

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,680
emerging there

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,240
is uh in the past we've seen many

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
companies

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
have had teams that they specifically

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,840
call devops

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,319
and this is kind of you know some people

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,360
this is

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,360
a bit problematic because if the idea

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,599
is to break down silos between different

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,120
teams then setting up a new team

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:58,240
called devops um perhaps doesn't

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,360
kind of match that ethos but what we are

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,280
starting to see is you know first we saw

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
lots of companies set up devops team as

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,400
their kind of way of saying okay we're

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
going to focus on this

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,759
then as as they kind of mature or things

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,919
evolve

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
um then they find that actually they

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
might rename those teams to better

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,240
reflect what they're doing

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,199
and one great example we had um was a

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,720
company called

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,199
ghost spot check and they um

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,560
are renaming their devops team to be

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,240
cloud ops

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
to better reflect that actually what

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
this team is doing is managing the

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,280
operations and the interaction with the

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,080
cloud

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,199
um everything from kind of the account

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,880
management to the scaling and to

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,400
adopting different technologies so i

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
think that's an interesting trend we'll

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,840
see

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
more about

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,160
okay um so i hope that answers that

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,759
question

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,319
and uh if you want to do any follow-ups

00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:01,520
uh please just let me know

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,879
okay another question um that's come

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,240
in is what is the difference between

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,800
continuous integration

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,800
continuous deployment and continuous

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,599
delivery

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
so that's a great question because uh we

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,680
do get

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,479
um a lot of con conversations in the

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,520
community

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,360
um discussing this and it is a point of

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,240
contention because different people

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,639
again see the definition differently and

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,400
the reason that could be a problem is

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,560
if you're talking at cross purposes with

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,159
someone else or

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,680
it leads to kind of a misunderstanding

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,279
now continuous integration i think

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,640
that is pretty how we see that is

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,680
that is where um developers or

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,839
practitioners

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,360
are constantly committing code and it's

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,200
being um

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,279
built like i don't want to use the word

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,279
integrated but it's being

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,000
whatever the process is to bring it into

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,800
the main line the tests are being run

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,640
and it make sure that you know your

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,880
working copy

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,480
is is always up to date and this is as

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,560
opposed to once upon a time where

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
integration would only happen

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,680
uh as a big bang effect so the

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
continuous uh is important so you

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,800
typically want that to happen once a day

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,399
um and so you're avoiding the situation

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
where code gets committed

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,240
uh you know once a year or things like

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
that

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,360
now on continuous deployment and

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,880
continuous delivery uh

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,680
i think these terms get used

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,920
interchangeably uh personally

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,080
i think it's really important that

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,440
continuous delivery

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,839
represents the entire set of practices

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,839
um that you must undertake to keep your

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,760
code in a state where you're

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,839
ready to deliver so i'd like to see it

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,560
more defined as an engineering approach

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,120
or even a discipline

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,200
but oftentimes people narrow that

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,640
definition and they use it to

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,360
reflect kind of just the deployment

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,560
stage

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,920
of of the the pipeline so then

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,000
continuous delivery and continuous

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,040
deployment get munched into the similar

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,279
thing

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,040
where continuous deployment refers to

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,240
you know actually getting your code

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,360
out into production um and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,519
all all the stages that lead up to that

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,200
so some places you'll read definitions

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,320
and they will just say deployment and

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,320
delivery only have the slight difference

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
but really i think you need to see

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,519
delivery as the

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
overall set of practices which does

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,600
include

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,560
continuous integration uh continuous

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,760
deployment or

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,000
automated deployment and uh

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,279
it does include other things as well so

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,800
testing

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,079
uh security

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,560
test data management and one of the

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,760
the great places um like the accelerate

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,839
book by

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,040
nicole fosgren and others i think that

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,000
kind of gives an

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,200
overview of how meaty continuous

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
delivery is and it

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,560
breaks it down into these eight

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,399
different capabilities so

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,640
i personally like to separate that where

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,839
continuous deployment can refer to

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,120
just kind of the automation deploy um

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,959
things like you're pushing things

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,519
between environments and finally out to

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,519
production

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,839
okay let me find a way to mark the

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
questions as answered

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
and

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,720
okay so i don't know if we've got some

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,600
support um i see the question and i

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,200
can't seem to

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,720
answer uh one of i can't seem to mark it

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,440
as answered live

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,440
um so just

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,800
i will try and figure that out

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,120
okay so the next question we have coming

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,560
in

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,279
is which tools can i use for

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,000
ci cd so continuous integration or

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,920
continuous

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,760
deployment and delivery so

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,560
this is kind of a big question because

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,440
it really depends but i want to give you

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,120
some indicators

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,959
as to how you can go about thinking

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,959
about you know what tools

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:50,480
um do i use now traditionally

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,839
um you know one of the defining tools

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,720
um for this has been jenkins and almost

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,920
everybody

00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,200
has in some way or the other used jenkin

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,560
now jenkins while we often think of it

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,160
as a cicd tool it it really is much more

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
powerful and much more flexible

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,839
than that so it is jenkins is the

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,079
ultimate sort of

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,760
automation server and it is really

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,279
really amazing its

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,600
sweet spot is for continuous integration

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
so that is kind of where the initial

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,240
growth in jenkins

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,360
used it helped kind of define uh

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,240
uh it just helped lots of people to

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,440
manage their

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,279
their ci in in the early days

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,120
and then it built on that and it evolved

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,360
to have pipelines

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
which would help you um actually deploy

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
the code

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,000
and in fact now these days we have a lot

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,760
more people using

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,120
jenkins pipelines than jenkins

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,560
kind of freeform jobs but if we

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,000
go beyond that in recent years the whole

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,839
landscape has really exploded and we've

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,639
had a lot of different kind of tools

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,040
come in

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,720
and one of the key drivers for this has

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,839
been the emergence of

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,079
cloud native technologies

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,360
and what the difference with cloud

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,279
native um

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
to what was there before is that you

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,920
have this

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,399
real strong distributed model

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,079
which allows endless scaling like you

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,959
can scale horizontally you can scale

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,279
vertically

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,560
and it really is kind of very very

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,920
powerful

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
and the same time as cloud native

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,279
technologies have

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,760
emerged we have um

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,680
a lot of different things changing about

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,320
how we

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
write and deliver software so this

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
includes

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,800
things like the move to microservices

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,040
uh traditionally teams would work on a

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,680
single code base so a monolithic code

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,639
base and they would deliver to

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,959
um very few environments now with the

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,040
onset of microservices and cloud native

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,000
technologies uh what we're seeing

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,959
is now uh teams delivering software have

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,480
to contend

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,600
with many more um like locations with

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
the code

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
uh it changes what the definition of the

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,480
application is

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,440
and this you know a big pluriphylla

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,959
proliferation of environments to deliver

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,399
to and as a result um we have a lot more

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,160
tools emerging

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,800
and i'm gonna drop a link to

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,240
the continuous delivery landscape which

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,279
is where we're trying to

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,440
categorize and kind of set out all the

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,360
different tools that come together to

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,680
help you deliver software

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,199
and because traditionally we've fallen

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,560
into this you know

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,519
juicy icd which leads people to think

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,040
i need a ci tool and a cd tool and

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,560
that's it my job is done

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,839
um it's actually much more involved than

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,920
that

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,000
and it does depend you know are you

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,480
starting a greenfield project

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,240
um are you looking at cloud native are

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,680
you trying to move something existing

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,240
and then that you also have options for

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,360
managed services as software as a

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,320
service

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,920
so um the landscape tends to give you

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,680
kind of breakdown into

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,360
big overarching chunks what the

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,959
different kinds of

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,120
areas are and then give you tool

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,040
suggestions in each one

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,800
and then you'll see in some categories

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
um this is broken up by

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
cloud native and traditional so there's

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,320
a category there around

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,720
infrastructure deployments now this uh

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,800
it is an early version of the the

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,440
landscape so it's pretty new and we do

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
welcome

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,720
it's open source so we do welcome

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
contributions

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,759
um so if you have a tool that you're

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,120
seeing is not there

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,680
please feel free to um submit a pull

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:56,720
request and we have a few guidelines

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,720
and uh we can um add that to it

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,040
okay i'm gonna click that it's answered

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,040
live

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,559
okay we have another question that's

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,919
come in

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,839
um and from eugene and it says

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,319
what are the benefits to join the

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,120
continuous delivery foundation

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,319
umbrella for the oss project part of

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,079
being a linux foundation project

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,319
marketing infrastructure funding

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,400
opportunities can you please explore

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,440
this topic

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
okay yes so i assume this is asking

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,720
about

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,679
um from the perspective of an open

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,480
source project

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,400
so it's a great question so why um would

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,000
an open source project choose to join

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,760
the continuous delivery approach

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,919
foundation so we are an

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,720
umbrella foundation similar to the cncf

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,799
we are a sub foundation of the linux

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,799
foundation so we consider cncf to be

00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:00,000
like a sibling organization and

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,480
under this umbrella um really

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,760
where continuous delivery foundation

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,440
helps the projects

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,760
is by helping them grow um

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,799
and taking care of a lot of the things

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,520
that you need for an open source project

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,240
that can benefit from doing them

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,080
together

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,000
so for example we offer a whole bunch of

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,679
services

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,360
um so we have um

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,880
a technical oversight committee which

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,480
brings kind of the leaders of the

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,760
project together

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,240
and then examples of things where

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
we help okay so you brought up marketing

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,280
um

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,880
that that's a good one and that ties in

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,000
a lot to our events

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,880
so for instance we had a cdcon which we

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,880
ran

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,080
two weeks ago and we had each of the

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,440
projects there

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,559
and we provided a space for folks to

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,039
come and meet the project leaders those

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,880
were some of the best conversations

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,880
so it's giving helping with that

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,240
organization of the project we're also

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,640
running hacktoberfest

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,760
across all the projects so we bring the

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,440
projects together

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,720
we help promote we let you know how to

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,360
you know structure your project for

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,600
hacktoberfest uh it's an amazing way to

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,240
get new contributors

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,039
so bringing in new people through these

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,360
programs

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,520
we also sponsor mentorship through

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,799
programs like outreachy which projects

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,919
used to increase

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,760
the diversity of the contributor base we

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,000
provide support for google summer of

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,880
code and upcoming google season of docs

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,559
to help improve documentation

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,160
on top of that there's some other fun

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,679
stuff we

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
the continuous delivery foundation does

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,280
some logos for projects if you've ever

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,960
seen the tacton project

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,480
and tacked on friends it's got some

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,559
great logos so

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,520
we'll set up logos for each of the

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,080
projects

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,640
we also have a continuous delivery store

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,480
um

00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:00,240
which has swag which

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,240

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,480

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,000
have a store

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,200
um which again we offer to all our

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,840
projects

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,880
uh we also deal with trademark and

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,400
licensing

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,640
issues so that we find projects you know

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
typically they want to focus on the code

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,760
so we're doing all

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,039

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,520
