Wow there's a pretty good crowd for a

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:12,030
Friday morning so three things I'm gonna

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,059
tell you the bad news I'm going to tell

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,320
you what I think the opportunity is and

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,930
then I'm going to tell you that I

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,670
believe that you all and the Linux

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:27,230
Foundation is one of the great leverage

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,230
points I really believe we have this

00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,760
there's a number that's missing here

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:45,440
does anybody know actually what four oh

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:52,440
nine point five nine represents anybody

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:54,750
back here yeah yep yesterday's number so

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,090
four oh nine point five nine that was

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,400
yesterday's number three fifty is

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,140
probably the number that we really want

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,450
to be at it's kind of the Goldilocks

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:09,390
number so what is 2050 2050 is basically

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:15,810
the point of no return that will pretty

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:20,250
much ensure that the next two or three

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,680
four thousand years is going to be

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:29,850
living what it is that we're doing right

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:31,920
now we're not doing right now so what's

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,920
really interesting is that when people

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,050
talk about their 2050 goals in a hundred

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,539
percent decarbonisation and removing

00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,899
carbon really fundamentally what they're

00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:45,569
talking about is that 94 percent of that

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,390
carbon can be removed through

00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:51,270
transportation and power so there's

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:55,649
actually a finite group of people and a

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:58,740
finite endeavor that you know it's it's

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,050
bracketed if yes it is everywhere in

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,509
everything but when you talk about power

00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,459
systems those are the systems that have

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,520
to be transformed and then the remaining

00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,490
part really is around agriculture and so

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,370
what you eat is actually incredibly

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:21,940
important in terms of mitigating climate

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:24,940
change so this is

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,450
see if you can track me here I I haven't

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:34,960
had a really good visual designer help

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:37,030
me with this but so in 2016 we used

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,780
about globally about a hundred and forty

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:48,900
five thousand terra watts of energy and

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:52,660
of that less than 5% were renewables in

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,120
2050 we will be using 380,000 terra

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,670
watts of energy so the implication of

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,880
that is that we are going to more than

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:06,210
double our energy requirements between

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:10,840
now and 2015 and so today's investment

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:21,940
in tomorrow's reality is equal to about

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:25,630
two percent that's not good what that

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,400
really means is that we are have only

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,930
solved about two percent of the problem

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,410
of 2015 so we live in a time in which we

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:39,880
have to have phenomenal technological

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:44,200
innovation and right now we're not

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,970
innovating at scale so for me about four

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,220
or five years ago I started to thinking

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:53,500
about what is the greatest example of

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:55,270
scaling and there are very few examples

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,280
of hyper scaling on the planet but there

00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,490
is one and every single person in this

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,520
room has actually in one way or another

00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,330
made their career related to it this is

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,850
actually a picture of the internet and

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:12,820
this is exactly what we have to do with

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:16,299
energy we need to leverage the same

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,709
design principles which are really what

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:24,100
you all are doing all day every day in

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,750
order to create what some people might

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,160
refer to as the Internet of energy I

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,700
don't know that it's the best metaphor

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,910
but I think that it is critical to

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,410
understand

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,730
what the scaling actually looks like and

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,660
at the foundation of that is

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:46,220
collaboration and cooperation so for me

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,530
you know open-source is an intellectual

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,050
property agreement that enables

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,660
collective action and there is no

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,630
problem that this planet has ever

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,650
experienced that so deeply and

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,880
intrinsically means collaborative action

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,330
so I wanted to talk a little bit about

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,150
what the grid looks like so I don't know

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:12,260
whether you know sort of the history of

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:14,600
electricity and the grid but electricity

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,810
and telecommunications really occurred

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,360
the you know the telephone and and the

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,120
first sort of transmission line occurred

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,290
pretty much of exactly the same time and

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,630
maybe there was like a ten year

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,850
difference between them and I think that

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,610
when we look at telecommunications we

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:35,080
have seen what happens when an industry

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,730
is fundamentally transformed by

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:42,290
digitalization well when it comes to

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:44,930
energy we haven't yet done that and so

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,090
the reason why LF energy exists and the

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,790
reason why it exists in the Linux

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,500
Foundation is because this is much

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,050
closer to what it is that we need to

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,540
create we have to network electrons and

00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,950
there is not a power systems engineer on

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,770
the planet that would tell you that you

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:04,850
can actually network electrons you can't

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:07,640
you can't do with a bit and you know

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,130
packets what you need to do with an

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,380
electron but what we can do is so that

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,590
we can network information about an

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:20,360
electron and in doing that we have the

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:25,220
ability to orchestrate it these concepts

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:27,140
are you know at the future vision of you

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,060
know where power systems see themselves

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,160
going and there are unicorns all over

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,990
the planet that recognize this is

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,820
actually what we have to be able to do

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,660
we have to be able to utilize

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,729
information and communication

00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,750
technologies to accelerate

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:45,860
transformation and I don't know whether

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,069
you all know this

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,569
but probably you know in the current

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:56,180
paradigm we may be waste 60% 70% in some

00:06:53,569 --> 00:07:00,699
cases 80% of electrons that are

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:05,000
generated so we have to build and create

00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:07,610
radical energy efficiency and that kind

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,280
of utilization of resources is also

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:14,090
exactly what you people all know how to

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,909
do so what's the current state it's

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,930
fragmented and disjointed across all

00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:22,520
parts the the farther that you get the

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,740
closed you know more into the built

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,860
environment the more fragmented it is

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,689
and and I think for that reason

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,279
LF energy really started with the

00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,889
transmission system operators because

00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:38,990
there are only 240 transmission system

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:41,409
operators on the planet or 260 and so

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,610
it's much easier to actually organize

00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,439
transmission system operators and

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,569
they're the ones who bring from

00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,969
generation they're the ones that

00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:53,150
actually move energy at high voltage and

00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:55,539
all of them recognize that the direction

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,949
that we need to be able to go towards is

00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:01,639
interoperability automation and advanced

00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:05,120
orchestration and if you recognize this

00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:08,629
graphic this came from ARPA it came from

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,599
LF networking we have to essentially do

00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:18,889
with energy what telecommunications has

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:23,060
been so within LF energy this is kind of

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:25,219
what our stack looks like today I tell

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:30,080
people that I feel a little bit like the

00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:33,199
Lucy character in Charles Schulz that

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,409
you know I put up a sign and it said you

00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:40,820
know energy sector come here and so we

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:43,370
started with a few code bodies mostly at

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,310
the transmission system level and what's

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,410
happened is that slowly but surely the

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,660
the code is beginning to come in and

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,269
there's a number of different ways that

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,110
it's happened one of them is through a

00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:59,390
very active end user group of utilities

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,480
who are looking at what they need and

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,400
recognizing the gap between what exists

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,680
in the marketplace and what it is that

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,060
needs to be created so one of the

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,370
projects that we're starting right now

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,740
is a digital substation project and

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,840
imagine so the substation is the place

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,790
where high voltage electricity gets

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,190
stepped down into medium and low voltage

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:25,250
and the reason why it's important is

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:28,490
that that the substation is essentially

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,590
an edge node router between the

00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,240
transmission and the control centers at

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:36,200
the generation that control the

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,620
distribution level and that it becomes

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,000
an edge node router out you know out you

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:46,610
know two photovoltaics two batteries to

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,130
networked hot-water heaters to HVAC

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,040
systems and that those things become

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,770
part of the orchestration capacity the

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,070
ability to shape loads and so you know

00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:00,230
when you think about electricity I think

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,930
it's sometimes really helpful to think

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,960
about water and you know how you think

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,490
about how water flows because in many

00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,180
ways that's what we're doing but

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,730
electricity is an instantaneously

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,130
perishable commodity however it is

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,890
absolutely critical to everything that

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:21,250
we do with regards to our economies and

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:25,370
so that's part of what is so problematic

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:28,070
about the transformation and why it's so

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,790
difficult I refer to it often as a

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,980
Gordian knot so what that means is that

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,430
you know we really have to defy the

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:41,510
logic of it and and I believe that the

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,970
Lenox foundation is one of the great

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,430
leverage points on the planet for being

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,490
able to accelerate collaboration and

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:53,990
cooperation that leads towards

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,490
transformation these are our founding

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,589
members we just got a new member

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,810
yesterday I have about 20 that are

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,000
coming in the pipeline mostly we've been

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:05,270
focused in Europe and I think that

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,990
that's because the United States is

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm having some problems you know and

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,730
sometimes sometimes I guess that means I

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,860
get mad about things like you know we'd

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,460
like to buy Greenland and I'm absolutely

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:25,520
horrified and embarrassed by that but

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,860
the other part that I feel about it is

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,110
that you know maybe we have to we have

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,050
to be able to increase the capacity of

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,060
the entire world and you know one of the

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,000
things that I say to people is that it

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,910
is not good enough that California or

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,400
New York or Massachusetts or Denmark or

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:46,370
the Netherlands decarbonize is because

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,830
we're talking about atmosphere and so

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,230
even if they're successful it is not

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,680
going to necessarily enable us to get to

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,190
20 50 and 100 percent decarbonisation

00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,970
another thing that I often talk about is

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:04,190
the scale of innovation that I recently

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,520
was listening to somebody talk about the

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:11,180
fact that a gigabyte of storage in 1986

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,980
was $75,000 today it's basically nothing

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,270
it's free it's like you know you wanted

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,080
to get something you want to store it

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:20,960
you stash it it's free and that's the

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:26,720
scale of innovation and so that is what

00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:31,520
I want to say to all of you and you know

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,220
I often share this picture this is

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,670
General Sherman and if you've never been

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,910
to Sequoia National Park it's not that

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,760
far from here General Sherman is the

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,880
largest single stem living thing on the

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,450
planet and this is a seed from General

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,460
Sherman and the reason why I carry it

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:58,520
with me and I share it with people is

00:12:52,460 --> 00:13:03,050
that you know I think we sometimes don't

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,510
recognize that the DNA of something has

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:09,440
the capacity to actually transform the

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:11,630
world and I believe that LF energy and

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,860
the Linux Foundation does have the

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,860
capacity to do that

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:23,480
so I talk to people about this being a

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,970
hero's journey and what I mean by that

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,100
and you know and i'm i you know i don't

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,590
know altogether the age of the people

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,570
who are sitting in the audience when I'm

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,740
talking to power system engineers and a

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:38,570
lot of them are all close to retirement

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,530
you know I kind of say if you are not

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:44,090
going to take a risk and actually

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:48,200
facilitate and enable the transformation

00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:50,960
if you are not going to empower you know

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,050
the the 40 year olds the 30 year olds

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,600
the 20 year olds if you are not going to

00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:02,720
begin to create a seat at the table for

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:06,350
the 10 year olds retire it's like it is

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:11,000
a it is a horrible legacy because this

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:15,620
is that generations journey and so when

00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,030
I think about you know why I want 10,000

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:25,930
developers I know that all of you know

00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:28,010
this but the fossil fuel industry is

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,110
more or less holding us hostage

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:36,530
particularly in the United States and

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:40,550
Australia and the implications of that

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:43,700
are that we have to create such an so

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:48,440
many 10,000 developers that it cannot be

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:51,170
stopped and so this is a very short

00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,420
bumper video that we created to help

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,020
explain sort of the context of what LF

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,020
energy is

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,250
at the linux foundation we've seen how

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:06,190
open-source shared technology can

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:09,820
transform industries now it's time for

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:12,070
energy and power imagine a future where

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,560
energy is delivered and you must more

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,529
efficiently by leveraging information

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,260
and communication technologies the

00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:22,420
future based on smart electric grids a

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,610
future where we can accelerate the

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,420
energy transition with clean power

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,940
sources

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,399
LF energy is a new linux foundation

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,920
project that supports multi vendor

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,500
collaboration and open source shared

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,540
technology innovation to help create the

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,139
electricity and power systems of

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,040
tomorrow all because we believe in the

00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,040
future that we share

00:15:50,190 --> 00:16:00,160
so cue 4 and then q1 of 2020 we have a

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,450
number of quite significant code bases

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,060
that are coming into the Linux

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:07,029
Foundation one of them is going to be

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,360
around crowd balancing it's the ability

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:12,370
to orchestrate electric mobility which

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,020
are basically batteries storage on

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:19,680
wheels and are both loads and resources

00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:23,800
another one is open smart grid platform

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:28,000
which really enables the transformation

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:31,440
of the substation into a data center

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,370
that can facilitate and orchestrate

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:40,630
devices and sensors and resources that

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:43,470
are at the edge there's a consent

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:46,360
management system that's coming in from

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,820
Estonia Estonia is the story that you

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,860
never heard about because you all heard

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,600
about the Ukraine but the Estonians have

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,779
been very successful in being able to

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,670
keep Russia off of their grid and

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:03,820
consent management the ability to

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:06,429
actually provide user data that can can

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:09,699
can help provide insights and enable new

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:12,400
markets to be developed we're going to

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,910
have a summit in Paris November 4th and

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,390
5th

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:21,100
please join us the place that I'm really

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:25,480
hoping that we can lead from is this

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:28,030
notion of 2050 together the marketing

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,429
folks were like initially saying no you

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:33,820
can't talk about 2050 it's too far out

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:37,000
people can't make their goals but I want

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:39,670
us to remember the things that exist on

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,280
this planet that could not have possibly

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:46,300
happened if we did not create far-off

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:49,150
and ambitious goals and this is the

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,370
number this is the place of no return so

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,160
what I want us all to start talking

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:58,600
about is where are we now and what do we

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,970
need to do next because like the Lenox

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:07,390
foundation we are creating the world

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:10,360
it's largest shared energy investment so

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,310
this is a live energy um please if you

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:17,950
have a question you want to talk reach

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:19,960
out to me totally interested to share

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,290
whatever we're doing and to bring you

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:29,119
into our community thank you very much

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:29,119
