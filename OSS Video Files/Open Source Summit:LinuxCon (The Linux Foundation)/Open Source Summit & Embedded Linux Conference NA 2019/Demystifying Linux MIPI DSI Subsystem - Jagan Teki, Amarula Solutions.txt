	Demystifying Linux MIPI DSI Subsystem - Jagan Teki, Amarula Solutions

Today every modern multimedia supported SoC's comprises of variety of display controller interfaces bounded with LCD panels or bridges and a GPU, to provide display acceleration. Out of many display controller interfaces the MIPI Display Serial Interface (MIPI DSI) is a versatile, high-speed interface for smartphones, tablets, laptops, automotive and other platforms. The Linux kernel support these controller interfaces via DRM subsystem with underlying DSI controllers, panels, bridges drivers.This talk start with a brief overview of Linux DRM subsystem with bounded display controller interfaces like HDMI, RGB, LVDS and DSI and then the talk switch to traverse more details about Linux MIPI DSI controller, DPHY, DSI panel, DSI bridge interfaces drivers along with how these display drivers are interact with GPU drivers. This talk is based on the work done on Allwinner MIPI DSI controller with variety of associated LCD panels, bridges by validating these interfaces via ARM Mali GPU.
