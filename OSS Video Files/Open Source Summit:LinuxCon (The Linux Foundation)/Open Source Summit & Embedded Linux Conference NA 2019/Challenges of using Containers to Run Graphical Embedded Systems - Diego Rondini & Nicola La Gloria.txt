	Challenges of using Containers to Run Graphical Embedded Systems - Diego Rondini & Nicola La Gloria, Kynetics

Despite their quick success and adoption, containers are already a well established technology and their use is steadily rising also in the embedded community. However the specific requirements of an embedded system set new challenges like running demanding graphical applications.While containers’ most common use case is to easily deploy headless server applications, graphical subsystem containerization is heavily dependent on the SOC GPU architecture.This session will provide an overview of the challenges encountered running X11 and Wayland applications inside docker containers on ARM SOCs. In particular we will focus on new advantages with respect to a traditional monolithic embedded OS but considering also container drawbacks and limitations.In our journey we’ll share our considerations and results with respect to different software setups, security & isolation, support for accelerated graphics and video decoding which are not an option on systems featuring a GUI.
