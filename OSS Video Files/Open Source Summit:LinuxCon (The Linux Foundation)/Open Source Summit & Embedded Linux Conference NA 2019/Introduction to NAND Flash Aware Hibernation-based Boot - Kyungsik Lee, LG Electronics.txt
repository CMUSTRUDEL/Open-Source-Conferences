	Introduction to NAND Flash Aware Hibernation-based Boot - Kyungsik Lee, LG Electronics

Boot time is important for many consumer electronics. One of ways to reduce boot time is to use hibernation-based techniques, however adopting such an approach could cause reliability issues due to the limited lifetime of NAND flash.In this talk Kyungsik will share issues of applying hibernation-based boot techniques to consumer electronics and the challenges he faced while improving NAND flash lifetime without performance regressions and introduce new hibernation techniques for extending the lifetime of NAND flash.The presentation is based on the work he has done to develop new features on top of the mainline kernel.
