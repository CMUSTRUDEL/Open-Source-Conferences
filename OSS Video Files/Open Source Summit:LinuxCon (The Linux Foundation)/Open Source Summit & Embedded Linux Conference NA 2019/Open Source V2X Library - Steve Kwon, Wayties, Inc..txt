Title: Open Source V2X Library - Steve Kwon, Wayties, Inc.
Publication date: 2019-09-16
Playlist: Open Source Summit & Embedded Linux Conference NA 2019
Description: 
	Open Source V2X Library - Steve Kwon, Wayties, Inc.

Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is the passing of information from a vehicle to any entity that may affect the vehicle. It uses different wireless technology and protocol standards unfamiliar to IoT developers like WiFi, 3G/4G and so on.In this talk, Steve Kwon will provide a brief overview V2X technology, and introduce open source implemented V2X library supporting both of DSRC/WAVE and C-V2X. Also, he will overview the concept architecture and show basic examples using this library and latest V2X chipset based hardwares.Attendees will be able to expect an understanding the V2X technology and learn how to develop V2X system and service based on this open source V2X library.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,660
people beginning my session I have a

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,900
passion to audience to have a how many

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:17,539
people family of KBTX cell and bit

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:22,340
extenders maybe you know one okay okay

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:29,420
at this talk I don't know introduce my

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:29,420
open source V text related software and

00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:39,830
i I want to introduce myself and I'm

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:42,690
working more than 10 years working

00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:47,520
telecommunication industry and also

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:52,140
working automotive side so very long

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:58,010
time too with this kind of communication

00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:03,360
technology and so the way it is is the

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:05,700
startup company at South Korea so we are

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,009
mainly developing VTX hardware and

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:14,460
software and some kind of testing tool

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:17,810
or so let's start possible I want to

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:23,610
briefly introduce the BTS technology

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:26,430
protects technology introduced in more

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,950
than 10 years ago basic concept is very

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,369
simple

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:38,780
some be I could send the own information

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:43,229
to other after that they response and or

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:48,780
some kind of action that's the basic

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:51,090
concept so no very similar to IOT

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,340
technology just the information sharing

00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:01,650
technology but some kind of a reaction

00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:07,890
makes some good example and application

00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:13,489
some slowdown information and loss

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:17,970
safety related information and also now

00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:22,940
this technology will be using smarter

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:27,150
City all devices are connected so

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:32,310
Michael can connected to infrastructure

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:35,100
and carve the whatever and also this

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,030
technology is adapting to autonomous

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,030
driving because

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,940
Kranti autonomous driver a biker has a

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,510
so many sensor that

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,930
there are some Rhema tation because is

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:56,390
the director sensitive but this is a

00:02:51,930 --> 00:03:01,290
radio based sensor can help such kind of

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:04,440
information more longer and some behind

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,570
the the building information behind the

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,140
building such kind of information can

00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:14,340
help autonomous driving so fully

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,450
autonomous driving can maybe will be

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:24,630
adapt this kind of technology okay

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,540
currently so many pallasite is working

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,870
and I'm going now

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:37,290
you got sided European side and a sham

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:43,410
also so but now there is some problem

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:47,570
because some radio technology issue more

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:50,910
than 10 years the SLC 5.9 gigahertz

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:54,090
radio technology is used in this

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:58,709
technology but CB checks or at web

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:04,940
technology will be adapted so now tooth

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,940
radio technology is debating now but

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:13,400
despite of it this situation this kind

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:20,190
of radio technology will be increased

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:23,220
their market so there's a market

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:29,340
situation and some information I want to

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:32,690
show posted this standard this is

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:37,190
focused on your side your side is

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,990
different to European side but basically

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,960
final message that dictionaries are

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,470
almost same but middle layer is already

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,620
different this is minimum set of sender

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:53,270
this there are so many standard but

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,270
minimis read some kind of

00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:02,350
the bottom layer is a app I am excited

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:06,730
it can be a head of the tile 11 it is

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:09,220
the SRC and she read text and 5g

00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:13,660
technology this recipe peeler is the 14

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:16,930
and 15 so this right here is the radio

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,080
technology and some additional handling

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:24,040
technology for the SRC

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:29,100
16:09 in that poll and after that there

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:33,310
are some handling picture too normally

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:39,430
this communication used does not use the

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:41,650
tcp/ip so it can be one option you can

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:45,870
be on option so you know a little

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:50,230
different technology protocol so many

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:54,460
best safety-related the message will

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:56,380
send the Debrecen p-wave some verses the

00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,940
protocol is so tree

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:03,790
the brass MP and there are some security

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:07,990
mechanism and also and terrorism as

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:11,980
itself to use the application side so

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:20,620
another we should consider there are

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:24,760
some encoding the sixth 1602 use SN SN

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:27,820
that one canonical all your home at I'm

00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:32,770
not sure you are familiar SN that one

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:38,190
but normally 3gpp and many multi video

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:40,900
technology use this SS than that ones so

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,510
another thing is this is bezel-set

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:48,790
dictionary I say

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:52,450
27:35 use ascendant what upolo we call

00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:56,080
opera but it is aligned with the practi

00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:59,470
encoding neural this is grandma is the

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,190
same but they encoding or decoding

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,020
differently so it all really different

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,610
so

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:11,550
what's a problem in this situation

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:15,960
posting is protocol is is so complicated

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:23,660
that that is similar to 3gpp or other

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:30,090
things but SN that one is a one of key

00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:34,080
problem because this new encoding new it

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:37,560
this is this oh yeah and PL is a little

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:43,259
you including yourself there are no of

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:45,720
the sauce fully support for pictures of

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,889
SN that one some kind of a parameter

00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,680
dilation classes such kind of with you

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:56,479
pressure does not support open source so

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,880
that's the main key problem of a

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:05,520
protection technology forced and of the

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:10,320
sources but many years the development

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:14,580
is such kind of encoding decoding open

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:19,070
source so it's not perfect but it will

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,070
cause it to commercial product to other

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:28,520
another one is you are not familiar it

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:33,930
may be because there are no hardware

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:38,479
publicly available so many IOT devices

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:44,420
they're available on market but it's not

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:48,290
the reason they not exist the publicly

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,450
PT axis is the partial VI curve so

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:56,220
automotive industry does not sell to

00:08:51,450 --> 00:09:02,579
consumer or some engineer so it's so

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:05,820
tested page of region so and this device

00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:09,170
that module has a longer development

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:13,230
time than consumer product because

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:16,170
vehicle is related to safety so just a

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:20,970
key problem you cannot buy the

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:26,670
thing even if sample another one is that

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:29,940
it is the PATA mayor as a terminal of

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:33,480
subscriber it's the same reason there on

00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,820
hardware and there's app on their

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,850
vendors own device the barber it cannot

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:44,400
be open so that's the key I my point

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,220
there's a key to problem is the ASN

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:51,600
problem and some device and tribal

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:56,210
problem so I want to handle these two

00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:01,350
things many so many times so people

00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:04,110
mention about that I will show some

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:11,570
message information and how to handle it

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:11,570
there are so many messages on sha 2735

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:21,450
fundamental message most page messages

00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:23,660
they accept messages ascended to 10

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,660
Hertz

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:32,430
for each second another there are so

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:38,220
many messages inside it and normally

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:42,180
less than done message grandma will be

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,970
compared by s and other compiler and it

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,970
will generate some encoding encoder and

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:54,420
decoder know for Grand Prix's that's the

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:57,140
under header and after that we

00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,930
programming with this encoding decoding

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:05,790
source code this is very basic function

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:13,290
may be similar this is sample of SN that

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:17,570
one from to 735 you can easily

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:19,889
understand it there are some constraint

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:26,720
so too

00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:31,230
the data common binary format similar to

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:38,819
1600 dud or 9.2 is there almost same

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:44,459
format yeah I predict a show after that

00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:48,089
I tried so many of the social comparison

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:52,170
to one one one of best option for C

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:58,439
compiler is the sn1 see you can gather

00:11:52,170 --> 00:12:02,790
some rinky as I remember three years ago

00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:09,779
it does not support so I a little hack

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:14,339
try try and after that I succeed this

00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:18,959
very small portion of this s ended one

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:21,689
format but nowadays it will be almost

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,040
support there are some morning decided

00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:28,769
this is a standard parametrization issue

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:34,670
there are some issue but it can be

00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:38,579
handled by programming so almost working

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:43,500
that we need the hard tester but almost

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:47,459
working now compare a zephyr so that's

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:53,339
the good time to use the discipline

00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:56,449
social compiler another one some there

00:12:53,339 --> 00:13:02,240
are some Python base the compiler it

00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:08,639
also available but they working uper but

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:14,699
does not support now so I think it is

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:17,970
the compiler is the one solution the the

00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:20,540
one solution on new and solution my

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:25,410
company uses dominate 3d print C

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:29,220
compiler is the cost is very huge so

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,830
there are some issues and this right

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:37,170
side is as an example

00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:41,580
and this one is the we are and this is a

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:43,610
loophole a very simple but you needed

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:48,540
some additional code to check

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:51,050
constraints at this and one C supports

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,980
the disk controller and constraint e but

00:13:51,050 --> 00:14:00,750
they didn't develop whole things that

00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:06,899
almost still can be usable so that's one

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:12,500
is this handle by officers are we

00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:18,600
talking about hardware will later but my

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:24,180
source the basic concept is two things

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:27,170
that I want to develop and retain the

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,850
seamless connectivity first posting and

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:38,209
another thing is there or attention and

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:43,140
highly-leveraged e so I do these things

00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:51,990
from black hole and VTX devices micro sd

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:54,990
node to cloud I want to convert a

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,529
standard or Masergy to some kind of

00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:00,720
interface definition language this is

00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:05,089
for example bottoms like vehicle side is

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:10,500
I use roasted robot operating system

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:14,010
maybe you are familiar it is used by

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:21,050
autumn know most driving research topic

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:27,839
and some Orion panda also trying now so

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:32,880
SN format we're changeable can it is

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:38,579
possible very easily and the bottom side

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:42,170
and also there are some idea most people

00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:45,360
Pam Pamela and proper protocol by Google

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:50,250
pepper poses or most similar

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:57,930
so we can convert to some different idea

00:15:50,250 --> 00:16:01,320
so at the bottom xiety and also this

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:07,170
idea can be converted these things so I

00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:11,190
want to make some called idea called

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:15,500
from idea it's in that one this is my

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:18,570
concept so easily convert data format

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,440
but them to the top beside the peg on

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:27,950
the side another thing is this

00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:31,820
rotational ret this lost person to use

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:34,890
this decision service and real-time

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:41,690
publishing a subscriber technology over

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:47,640
tcp/ip it is many focused on real-time

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:49,800
traffic so it is low latency and high

00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,620
reliability there are so many ways

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,589
technology parameter curves per liter

00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:01,140
DDA stay healthy so it can be possible

00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:05,579
and also VI curve you will use this

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:11,459
technology now so that's a good point

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:16,140
and my device also supported some steps

00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:21,600
access point for standard to you using

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:27,720
ideal so you can be connected to from

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:32,669
table to even ptex device and deciding

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:37,790
is we use many people use mqtt or have

00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:42,120
Soquel so it can be a good data

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:46,200
communication channel so MQTT also have

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:50,540
some curious technology so prop up idea

00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:56,070
can convert to so many other energy

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:58,050
nodejs Python whatever so many things

00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,630
there are more than 10 in English

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:05,080
support

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:08,920
so decided focus on C or Python because

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:15,300
the roster support license and decide is

00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:19,530
as available all language technology so

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:23,560
we I could divisive bi-color Etsy

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:32,040
Cardinal the can usual collectible this

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:35,080
is my goal and concept so I develop a

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:43,060
guy called device and protects device

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:46,570
and PSID posture there are two must

00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:52,860
there are already so many me Palmer says

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:56,350
type of lost to technology but mainly I

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,790
interviewed shootings public a publisher

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:02,350
and subscriber is this a single path and

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,800
another one is it will cast in response

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:09,130
for example the client requested to

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,120
establish some information and a

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:15,970
response

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:21,900
this is one power so normally the ship

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:24,850
data can be implemented using publishing

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:33,570
subscribing technology so easy easy

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:33,570
so pts device publishes some data to

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:41,590
six-year-old ooh 9.3 this is almost

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,560
bottom layer of protocol so the

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:49,120
publishing operator this is secret radio

00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:54,640
tattoo it is the one thing and designed

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:57,220
according to read it three three parable

00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,960
to talk to payroll

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:06,510
decoding and after that similar that is

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:11,730
decoding after that publishing I said

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:15,130
27:35 and our Excel vacation can get

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:20,410
effort they implemented the subscription

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:26,730
so another thing is a check cited text

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:32,590
app should handle whole service so they

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:36,300
it data CalSTRS some encoding to this

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:39,850
service message the service and some

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:43,330
certification service for security and

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:47,050
send the checks there are some compound

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:51,730
so this is the basic concept and it will

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:58,480
be connected to you donut so this is

00:20:51,730 --> 00:21:02,470
rage concept is darker one is already

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:09,490
implemented and this checks is now

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:16,500
developing so the another example this

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:20,170
is the service access point summary

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:24,910
six-year-old 9.3 and for example this is

00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:28,780
a very fundamental this is requested for

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:31,840
sending and respond and after they get

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:35,100
at some visual indicate an indication

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:41,220
music receive month so this is very

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:43,990
basic for TX and rx so for example

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:47,220
posted the calcium come home

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:50,920
can be replaced to recast the response

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:54,820
message format poor lost person second

00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:59,020
so for example this is a you can get

00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:04,060
some poverty information from standard

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,480
so I made and a little removal and added

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,820
something

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:13,200
so this is a top side is the recast

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:17,260
bottom side is the response and

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:21,430
publishes simple just one topic on top

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:22,910
side only this kind of mail message I

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:27,980
made it

00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:32,840
and other things will be all same but so

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:36,920
this is example I made some device

00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:40,540
emulator to send the pastorate publisher

00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:44,540
this is a some center packet and they

00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:48,650
subscribing and decoding and send it to

00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:52,150
other laws and subscribe and send the

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:55,760
other world and this is a finally German

00:22:52,150 --> 00:23:01,460
maybe it will be similar RS application

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:04,900
and this is the loss topic echo I use

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:08,540
your most commander this is it this is

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:12,380
psi messaging actually but data is the

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:16,670
almost Gerald because they are I tried

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:19,160
to some sample so tele shipping and they

00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:23,990
destroying some information you can get

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:34,180
you can use this message to for

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:38,540
application ok not next thing how about

00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:48,830
the text device we want to low cost you

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:52,070
I presented this topic turn it 15 I made

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:56,330
it this device because this is a single

00:23:52,070 --> 00:24:02,810
board computer IMAX is 6 at the time for

00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:09,950
scale and I use this Wi-Fi module this

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:14,780
is now less than $10 so very low cost

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:20,060
and but this device is a little costly

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:26,230
I remember along the $300 maybe around

00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:31,060
death so this

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:35,920
by PI module supposed five on 5.9

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:39,820
gigahertz pack so look there are some

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,850
Linux Apache and multiplication that

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,020
existed and so I adapted this whole

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:52,180
things that to this device eyes success

00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:57,640
techs are activated the general attacks

00:24:52,180 --> 00:25:00,790
device normally country the first

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:05,110
implementation of gtx device the cost is

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:11,830
around the member minimum person's

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:15,610
dollar and modem and some bender does

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:23,290
not sell such kind things to a very

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:28,720
small company and today we use cheap in

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:33,190
texas so from cocoa but coca munches

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:39,490
some rice and pasta so you cannot

00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:45,340
usually get somebody and some bullet so

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:51,570
that's a key problem so this is this is

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:57,250
the 3d data but high design and develop

00:25:51,570 --> 00:26:01,330
already so this is this is rejected

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:06,460
module from your blocks this is no

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:08,590
production it's not simple normally

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,590
reference the device does not have a

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:15,190
production chipset normally they use the

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:20,500
engineer example so we cannot sell to

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:25,290
everybody so it is not possible so one

00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:32,430
possible solution is from your box so I

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:35,130
adapt and I added some controller

00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:39,660
normally they use Linux application

00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:44,750
processor but I have this driver to MgO

00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:48,720
and make some service access point and

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:51,540
it will connect to you don't know that

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,320
this hummus is a ready point we are now

00:26:51,540 --> 00:27:01,620
using auto want a reason and now so this

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:06,420
this is not rj45 but connector will be

00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:10,940
changeable so we fully design now but we

00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:15,450
are wearing high accuracy GPS it will be

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:20,070
available next next month and at the

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:27,990
time just an engineering example so we

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:31,650
reading now so I hopefully this device

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:34,200
has a role similar to this device the

00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:40,980
price price is similar to this device

00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:45,950
and a little more less than with this

00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:51,780
enclosure less than 10000 I hopefully I

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:54,800
want to develop it so other hot side

00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:58,950
application will be open source so

00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:03,630
everybody can handle pretext and pitch

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:07,580
x-ray the application many people most

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:10,710
people cannot not easy to handle

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,750
functional basic safety message because

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:16,230
it it depends

00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:20,370
it's tended to from vehicle to a

00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:22,580
so it is related safety but vehicle to

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:27,510
infrastructure and we I recruited cloud

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:32,870
will be available so that's the reason I

00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:36,450
made it this kind of device but I ready

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:40,130
production I hopefully want to do

00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,130
production this kind of device but

00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:50,090
very afraid the customers will be very

00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:54,619
small but at that time customer we are

00:28:50,090 --> 00:29:01,999
little higher so I think that I wanna

00:28:54,619 --> 00:29:08,090
load that cost now trying so I show some

00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:13,369
pictures and roadmap and of this month I

00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:17,059
have know the source code names from

00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:22,519
message this is the RX technology I am

00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:28,009
loaded my child get off and after that

00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:32,379
trying to text contrary I made it by

00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:38,389
hand this function has been that one to

00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:43,659
Noster idea but I'm trying now using

00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:48,080
options just it's non compiler it will

00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:51,169
be possible I think and after that

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,409
another one will be trying and this

00:29:51,169 --> 00:30:01,789
device is it target release day it is

00:29:54,409 --> 00:30:06,139
the tenant October so and another thing

00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:10,279
is we have some modern license for she

00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:13,100
beat X so this thing is not product so

00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:17,239
production so engineering example will

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:22,389
be available maybe and of October I

00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:26,350
think and we retry other chips that

00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:30,220
bender next year contrary we have as in

00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:34,909
two more vendor like two more bender and

00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:39,169
3 chipset already three module some

00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:46,100
Japanese company Korean company semester

00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:48,739
so but next year we will adapt test

00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,130
device also so for engineering and

00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:55,860
testing too

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:59,190
and another this thing is will be

00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,650
support relays this device device

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:06,320
connectivity and management chip and a

00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:09,240
