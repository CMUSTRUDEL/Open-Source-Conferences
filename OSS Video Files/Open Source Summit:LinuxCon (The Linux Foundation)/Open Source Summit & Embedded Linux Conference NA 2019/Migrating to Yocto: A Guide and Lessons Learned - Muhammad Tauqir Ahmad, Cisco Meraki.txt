	Migrating to Yocto: A Guide and Lessons Learned - Muhammad Tauqir Ahmad, Cisco Meraki

Tauqir and Ram took it upon themselves to migrate the build system for the whole engineering organization about 2 years ago at Cisco Meraki. The need arose from a new platform that was very well-supported on yocto. But there was already a pressing need to migrate to a more modern build system from the old, unmaintained copy of OpenWRT in use. They will go into how they went about doing it and the lessons they learned along the way including the technical challenges like supporting proprietary software on yocto, verifying correctness of the builds produced by the new build system, accommodating the various use cases at Meraki, integrating with existing CI systems, as well as human aspects of such a large migration like getting buy-in from stakeholders, documenting process and maintenance and devising an iterative, non-disruptive migration path.
