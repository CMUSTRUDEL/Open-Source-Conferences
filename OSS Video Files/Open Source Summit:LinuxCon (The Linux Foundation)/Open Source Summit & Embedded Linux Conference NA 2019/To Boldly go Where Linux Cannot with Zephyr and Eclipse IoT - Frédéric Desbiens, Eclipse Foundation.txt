	To Boldly go Where Linux Cannot with Zephyr and Eclipse IoT - Frédéric Desbiens, Eclipse Foundation

Linux is a versatile operating system; it can power smart watches, mainframes and everything in between. However, if a constrained device only possesses a few megabytes of memory and a CPU running at a few dozen megahertz, Linux will simply not fit. Enter the Zephyr real-time operating system (RTOS), from the Linux Foundation. Zephyr is a really small footprint, real-time operating system built with security and safety in mind for highly constrained environments. It can go where Linux can't.Having a great OS is only the first step in building a constrained device. You will also need to manage it and exchange data with it. In this presentation, you will learn how to do both using the Eclipse Paho MQTT client and the Eclipse Waakama OMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) library. You will also discover other components of the Eclipse IoT system that could be useful to you, and even learn the basics of Zephyr if you are new to it.
