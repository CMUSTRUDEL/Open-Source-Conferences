I was never on the board of the ASF I

00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:07,830
should there you go participation so

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,130
Jim's right I'm actually not here to

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,190
talk about technology at all maybe in a

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,389
broader context what I actually want to

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,940
spend some time thinking about I'm gonna

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,710
have a request for everybody as Contra

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,140
tribute errs to open-source communities

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,050
as leaders and in companies that that do

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,210
open source but I'll come back to that

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,720
request in a minute so I want to step

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,140
back and and remind everybody about some

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,910
context that the typical enterprise

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,820
organization is is kind of living in

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,399
this world of a lot of change right so

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,050
we can all agree that open source cloud

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,239
just software in generals really

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,090
fundamentally change the economy the

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,590
world economy the way that we interact

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,840
with companies the way the companies

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,489
interact with each other in this very

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,940
fundamental way right

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,680
agility technical aptitude ability to

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,170
respond to market conditions that are

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,710
changing these things are just how you

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,360
survive now as a company but even beyond

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,460
that right our connected world of

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,680
information technologies is one thing

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,760
but we also see technologies from other

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,340
areas of science colliding with IT and

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,979
we've entered this phase as a society as

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,140
a global society where change is now

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,450
happening at such a rapid rate that

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,909
humans and organizations are struggling

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:32,900
to actually embrace it adopted and adapt

00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:35,700
effectively now most of you are

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,590
technologists that are probably you

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,090
consider yourself to be you know pretty

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,619
up-to-date on what's going on in your

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,630
particular part of the world right I

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,700
think we all like technology here

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,950
anybody here not like technology yeah

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:54,630
cool all right the one guy in the front

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:56,610
it's at the wrong conference I love

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,460
technology right I love the you know the

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,670
new things I love actually embracing new

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,520
opportunities I love looking at how we

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,290
can combine work from AI with you know

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,379
cloud platforms and seeing the

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,170
possibilities there right but think

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,590
about someone whose job isn't to pay

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,030
attention

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,550
to the latest and greatest changes right

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,530
who can't keep up with the pace of

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,170
innovation that's happening in the broad

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,239
technology landscape it's like a giant

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,950
wave the tsunami that's constantly

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,030
crashing on them multiple tsunamis

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,370
they're hitting them over and over and

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,560
over again and it's really confusing and

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,560
I spent a lot of time with large

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,470
enterprise mid-sized enterprise IT

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,810
directors CIOs but also leaders in the

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,370
line it lines a business and they're

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,530
really struggling with this pace of

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,180
change so you know you might say yeah

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,500
they have to navigate this wave right

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,209
now we in the cloud foundry community

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,849
have been using this metaphor of a

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,690
kayaker as the right way to approach

00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,519
navigating the world of change that we

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,750
live in right you need to ride these

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,120
waves you need to figure out how to

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,010
navigate through them you don't want to

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,540
be knocked over by them right so it

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,450
requires balance and requires agility

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,190
and lots has been written you know

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,230
Nicole talked a lot about how DevOps

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,950
it's variable to measure effectiveness

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,510
of software delivery by looking at you

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,160
know more agile practices both in

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,180
operations and software development

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,889
there's you know there's macro questions

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,209
about can businesses maintain

00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,049
sustainable competitive advantage

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,209
anymore

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,930
no they have to actually be able to

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,519
respond constantly and change what their

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,980
competitive advantage is as the market

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,180
dynamics change around them but I'm here

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,829
in an open-source conference of course

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,030
right so what does this have to do with

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:44,010
with open source I'd argue everything

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,380
right because open source is massive

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,900
it's it's not just software it's now

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,760
hardware it's data it's moving into

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,760
other parts of science and engineering

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,500
that you would have never expected to

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,569
have open communities built inside of

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,000
them but just thinking about the typical

00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:03,239
enterprise it used to be that we thought

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,540
about open source as freedom from

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,150
locking now that might be true but we do

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,310
a we do - global perception studies

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,019
every year and one of the things that we

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,630
found in our last wave in the spring of

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,340
this year was that two-thirds of the

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,590
organizations that we talked to and this

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,419
is around the globe don't look at open

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,070
source predominantly as avoiding locking

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,590
they actually look at it as a way to

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,090
open up opportunities right it's a point

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,840
of leverage for them it's a way that

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,900
they can

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,800
take advantage of a broad community of

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,970
creative people that are going to give

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,130
them something new that they can

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,919
integrate and so that's why as

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,680
open-source contributors as open source

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,940
leaders I have a few things I'd like to

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,620
ask of you

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,790
when you think about your communities

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,010
and you think about the work that you're

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,090
doing to help support these enterprises

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,720
that are struggling with the pace of

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,820
change so three things the first is I

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,919
know the cathedral and the bazaar is

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,350
possibly a trigger word or phrase for

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,080
some of you you know great work great

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,300
you know great beginning to the open

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,590
source movement but I actually think the

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,300
metaphor applies in a slightly different

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:11,580
way the cathedral and the bazaar right

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,530
structure and chaos these two things

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,840
actually work really well together this

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,360
is a picture of la sagrada familia it's

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,389
one of gaudi's greatest works it's

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,190
almost done it's been nearly 140 years

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,800
worth of building it but it's a great

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,690
example of where you can take lots of

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,880
structure and you can take lots of

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,810
organic creativity and you bring them

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,389
together to something that's really

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,160
great open-source communities need to

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,590
think about how you integrate with

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,479
proprietary software right you need to

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,800
think about how you work with services

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,270
that might not be open source based

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,490
because that's the world that the

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,020
enterprise lives in so embrace those two

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,120
things together there's a duality there

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,450
that's good it's okay it's helping the

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,070
world build bridges right build bridges

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,060
between communities and that's not just

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,220
so that we can have a better

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,840
collaboration with each other but it's

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,690
actually so that the end users have

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,750
ramps to get into other parts of the

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,539
open-source ecosystem it allows them to

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,010
adopt some technology get some value

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,599
from it and then maybe take a step

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,729
across another bridge that your

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,950
community has built to find something

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,490
new something useful right it helps them

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,710
navigate between these communities Third

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,169
Point big change into your project in

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,639
your community's DNA right because just

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,770
like the enterprise is just like the

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,419
companies in the in the nation states

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,630
are dealing with constant change in

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,610
technology and science so are you right

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,470
this creative destruction process that

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,200
we've created where things get created

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,640
old things might go away we need to bake

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,380
that into the way our communities think

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,780
be comfortable with the fact that we're

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,219
going to constantly be changing

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,590
so those are my three requests and

00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:49,590
opensource really you know any software

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,689
it gets created for users right the user

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,939
might be a single person the person who

00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:56,430
wrote it where it might be a large

00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,229
multinational or even a nation-state

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,210
that's relying on that software to do

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:03,180
something valuable you know for their

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,650
customers for the citizens and I started

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,020
the talk by saying I had a request for

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,939
you and here's what it is right we is

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,330
open source practitioners need to think

00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:14,430
more about the users that are not deeply

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,199
involved in open source we need to think

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,699
more about helping them navigate this

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,099
world of change we need to think more

00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,319
about helping them cross between

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,599
communities cross between proprietary

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,430
and open source software so that's my

00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,610
request to all of you and thank you very

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,610
