	Cutting Edge Toolchain (Latest Features in GCC/GLIBC) - Victor Rodriguez, Intel

Toolchain technology is a day to day tool used by Linux developers. The core system of this technology is released every year (GLIBC twice a year). However, what new technology is being implemented on these releases? How can we as Linux developers can take advantage of these new features? This presentation aims to show an introduction to the major features released in GCC 8/9 and Glibc 2.29. Recent compilers came with new features and performance optimizations including various improvements in the diagnostics, Inter-procedural optimization improvements, Link-time optimization improvements and even fcf-protection for security attacks. At the same time, the glibc came with changes such as getcpu wrapper function has been added, which returns the currently used CPU and NUMA node. Having a better understanding of the toolchains allows showcasing the best of CPU architecture technology, from low-level kernel features to complex applications which span the entire operating system
