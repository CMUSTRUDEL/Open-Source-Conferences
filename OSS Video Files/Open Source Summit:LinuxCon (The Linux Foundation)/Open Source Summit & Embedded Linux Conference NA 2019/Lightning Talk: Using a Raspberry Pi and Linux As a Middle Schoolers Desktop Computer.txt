	Lightning Talk: Using a Raspberry Pi and Linux As a Middle Schoolers Desktop Computer - Tyler Mestery

The Raspberry Pi is a popular hobbyist computer which is also capable of being a desktop computer. Running linux, a Raspberry Pi can be used to perform many tasks. As a student in middle school, I use a computer for many school related activities. I’ve decided to see if I can make use of a Raspberry Pi as my only computer for all of my school and hobby activities. One of the things that I will be using it for is to be my daily computer, where I will do my homework. I will also be using the Raspberry Pi for, learning to program and explore Linux as my desktop operating system. I want to see if Linux can truly be the desktop computer for kids in school and at home. Some things that I will be testing are school websites, like Schoology, Google docs, my schools webpage, and more. In the end, I will show if it’s possible for kids to use Linux as their main desktop computer for their school and hobby projects.

hello everyone my name is Tyler Mestre

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,940
and today I'm here to talk to you about

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,170
using a Raspberry Pi as a desktop

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,450
computer so I am in eighth grade a

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,360
minute and am a student at Lake Middle

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,730
School in Woodbury Minnesota I was first

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,460
introduced to engineering on my school's

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,279
robotics team as well as my Stupa last M

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,470
class they helped spark my interest to

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,910
engineering as well as the fact that my

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,769
dad's an engineer and I look up to him

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,600
when I first told my grandma that I was

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,160
doing a project involving the Raspberry

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,520
Pi she thought it was an actual

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,860
Raspberry Pi but it's much more than a

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,140
PI it's a single board computer that can

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,789
do so many different things like for

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,010
example they're usually used as a

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:55,829
embedded computer or a high-powered

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:59,850
microcontroller I am using a Raspberry

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,940
Pi 3 B+ the version of Linux I'm running

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,229
is raspbian version 9 stretch I'm using

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:12,659
a 1080p monitor and I'm also using a

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:16,799
wireless keyboard and mouse so most kids

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,960
my age at my school use a laptop to do

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,650
their schoolwork so that's why I am

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,479
comparing the Raspberry Pi to a laptop

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,790
so some negatives unlike a laptop you

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,409
have to make your Raspberry Pi so that

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,479
means you have to get the Raspberry Pi

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:36,509
case SD card monitor HDMI cable mouse

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,549
and more it may take longer to turn on

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,579
and it might be a little slower than in

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,430
a laptop some positives to last look

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,049
less expensive than a laptop and there

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,810
are a ton of other uses for Raspberry Pi

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,060
other than being a desktop computer also

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,180
with the Raspberry Pi you get to choose

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,829
the size of your monitor and keyboard

00:01:53,180 --> 00:02:00,240
versus on a laptop it's made small and

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:02,670
portable so the good news is almost

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,649
everything worked the websites I used

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,680
worked as well as the school projects I

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,869
completed it on it most projects I made

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,120
we're on Google Apps but for one class I

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:17,700
did clip together a lot of short videos

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,379
and edit them to make a newscast I've

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,360
always been learning parts of Python

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,560
here and there so I decided to see if

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,409
the raspberry probably could handle the

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,260
job I use a Python book that calls for

00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,090
Python 3 Idol which works out really

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,819
well cuz the Raspberry Pi comes

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,930
pre-installed with it

00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:37,110
Raspberry Pi also comes pre-installed

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:42,060
with 10 other programming sites like

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,829
scratch in bluej Java there's almost an

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,739
unlimited amount of games you can play

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,150
on this old or new there's a couple

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,489
different kinds of applications you can

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,140
play your games on like for example you

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,359
can go in terminal and get some games

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,709
off there or you can just play the games

00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:58,709
or ice butter pie comes pre-installed

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,989
with the game sound is quiet for my

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,579
monitor so I decided to hook up my

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,859
bluetooth speaker to it and that made

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,859
the quality and the sound a lot louder

00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,420
Google Apps didn't load on Firefox so I

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,370
tried loading it on Google Chrome and it

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:19,200
ended up working compared to a laptop

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,720
computer the Raspberry Pi takes up a lot

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,959
more space because the Raspberry Pi is a

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,030
mouse keyboard and monitor versus on my

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,099
old laptop the keyboard mouse and

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,260
monitor are all made connected and

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,730
together it can be especially annoying

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,879
for me since I already have to fit all

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:40,980
my school supplies on it like my binder

00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:43,290
and notebooks on my desk so right i

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,419
Raspberry Pi Linux and everything else

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,090
went smoothly except for the fact you

00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,040
can take a while for webpages to load

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,690
the websites I tested worked except for

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,970
Google Apps which would only load on

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,980
Google Chrome so I would say the

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,519
Raspberry Pi and Linux can be used for

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,669
kids at school work and at home thank

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,669
you

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,080
