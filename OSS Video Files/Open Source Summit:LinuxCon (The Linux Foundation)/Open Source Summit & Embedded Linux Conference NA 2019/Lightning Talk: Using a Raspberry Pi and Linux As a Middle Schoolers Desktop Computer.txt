	Lightning Talk: Using a Raspberry Pi and Linux As a Middle Schoolers Desktop Computer - Tyler Mestery

The Raspberry Pi is a popular hobbyist computer which is also capable of being a desktop computer. Running linux, a Raspberry Pi can be used to perform many tasks. As a student in middle school, I use a computer for many school related activities. I’ve decided to see if I can make use of a Raspberry Pi as my only computer for all of my school and hobby activities. One of the things that I will be using it for is to be my daily computer, where I will do my homework. I will also be using the Raspberry Pi for, learning to program and explore Linux as my desktop operating system. I want to see if Linux can truly be the desktop computer for kids in school and at home. Some things that I will be testing are school websites, like Schoology, Google docs, my schools webpage, and more. In the end, I will show if it’s possible for kids to use Linux as their main desktop computer for their school and hobby projects.
