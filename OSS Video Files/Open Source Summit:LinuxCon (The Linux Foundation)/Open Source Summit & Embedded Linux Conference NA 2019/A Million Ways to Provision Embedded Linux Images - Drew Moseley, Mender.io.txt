	A Million Ways to Provision Embedded Linux Images - Drew Moseley, Mender.io

Embedded Linux is increasingly common due to the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT). There are countless off-the-shelf hardware platforms capable of running Embedded Linux, each with their own way to generate and provision images to device storage media.OpenEmbedded is a popular build system for Embedded Linux and is supported by a wide variety of board manufacturers.
