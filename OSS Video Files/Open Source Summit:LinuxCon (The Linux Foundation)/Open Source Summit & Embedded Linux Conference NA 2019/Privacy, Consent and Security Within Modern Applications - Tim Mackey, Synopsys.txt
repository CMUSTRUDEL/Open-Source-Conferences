	Privacy, Consent and Security Within Modern Applications - Tim Mackey, Synopsys

Rapid application innovation is characterized in part using shared code from open source components. While open source development offers many benefits, when regulators change the rules our strengths can prove problematic for ongoing regulatory compliance. For example, in January 2019 French regulators highlighted that the initial experience with Android violated consent and transparency provisions in GDPR imposing a hefty fine upon Google. Given privacy regulations like GDPR exist due to security issues within product offerings, it’s time to look at software development not just through a security lens but also through a consent and privacy one.In this session we’ll cover:- Security expectations regulators are creating for consumers- How to identify sensitive data as defined by regulators- The role and lifecycle of user consent in product operations- Models to identify data processing and third-party data transfers
