hello welcome to the second day of open

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,760
source summit I'm shower hung I'm the

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:13,349
director of ecosystem at the cloud

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,750
native computing foundation so as Jim

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:19,800
just said CN CF is the home of

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:23,609
kubernetes Prometheus and dozens of

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,460
other open source projects including the

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:32,820
49 who just joined we are now supported

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:36,030
by 469 members and the end-user

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,579
community has dozens and dozens of

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,739
well-known companies who are relying on

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,980
containers and using cloud native

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,800
technologies in fact one of my favorite

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,530
moments from the last Kubik on cloud

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,930
native corn was watching CERN the

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,140
European Organization for Nuclear

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,590
Research we discovered the Higgs boson

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,710
particle live on stage using kubernetes

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:07,189
to auto-scale their applications and

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:10,260
auto-scale their clusters but in truth

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:14,010
the majority of organizations are not

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,740
anywhere near there so this survey asked

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,860
organizations what percentage of your

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,520
containers run in production and if you

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:27,439
look over at the left you can see that

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,110
even though there is change since 2018

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:36,990
40% of companies don't even run 10% of

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:40,890
their containers in production so what

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:44,659
are the barriers so these are perhaps

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:48,149
similar to a lot of open source projects

00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:52,200
it's difficult to integrate applications

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,180
tools and environments together it's

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,219
difficult to manage upgrades to

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,610
determine and track where data is

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:04,110
located and enterprise's need to manage

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:08,099
security identity compliance and have

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,709
the tools to manage cost and while these

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,240
are all important topics and important

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,740
challenges that need to be solved

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,260
I'm actually going to take a different

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:21,520
turn and talk about some other kind of

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:26,230
challenge and that challenge is climate

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,140
change so in the UK where I live people

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,840
are talking about eating less meat and

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,090
using less plastic bags and using less

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,240
plastic straws and I'm pretty sure

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:41,890
that's the same here in California but

00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:45,760
data centers emit as much co2 as the

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:49,150
airline industry if the global IT

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,460
industry were a country only China and

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,780
the United States contribute more to

00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,870
climate change so what do you do about

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,740
it

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:06,940
so here's two examples from kubernetes

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:09,970
so kubernetes enabled Spotify to reduce

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,490
their CPU utilization by two to three

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:17,860
times through bin packing and

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:21,100
multi-tenancy the city of Montreal moved

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,920
200 application components running on

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:28,330
hundreds of virtual machines down to

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,670
eight machines and as engineers we can

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,510
applaud the productivity and efficiency

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:38,260
gains and for organizations the cost

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:41,920
savings are obvious but this also means

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:45,280
that we can do more with less we can use

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:52,060
fewer resources and less energy to run

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:55,270
the same workloads so if you look at

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,670
global Internet traffic it's doubled if

00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:02,020
that's more than doubled every four

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:05,740
years and with video and IOT and edge

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,750
computing and people in China and India

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,510
and lots of other countries coming

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,380
online for the first time this trend is

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:17,590
set to continue so what I want to say to

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,680
you is I think we all know that

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:24,270
infrastructure matters but the impact of

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,270
that is going to be rtÃ©

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,510
so thank you you can see my slides at

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,490
Osho calm

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,490
