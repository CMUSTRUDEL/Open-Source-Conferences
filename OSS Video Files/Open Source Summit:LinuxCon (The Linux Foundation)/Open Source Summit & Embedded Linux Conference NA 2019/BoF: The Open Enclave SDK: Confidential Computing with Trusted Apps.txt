	BoF: The Open Enclave SDK: Confidential Computing with Trusted Apps â€“ Simon Leet and Andrew Schwartzmeyer, Microsoft

Cloud computing today primarily address the challenges of encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit, but not while in use; Confidential Computing is an initiative focusing on this last step of securing data in use to close the gap.One enabler of Confidential Computing is the use of hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), such as Intel's SGX, that allow encrypted data to be processed as plaintext in memory without exposing it to the rest of the system. The Open Enclave SDK is a project that attempts to support the development of Trusted Applications across different TEE. This BoF provides an informal setting to learn more about Open Enclave or Confidential Computing and how you can get involved.
