Title: Internet of Things Education Outside the Computer Science Lab
Publication date: 2019-09-16
Playlist: Open Source Summit & Embedded Linux Conference NA 2019
Description: 
	Internet of Things Education Outside the Computer Science Lab - Alexandru Radovici & Alexandru Vochescu, Politehnica University of Bucharest

Internet of Things is now part of many high-schools or universitiesâ€™ curricula. While for computer science students, this is just another regular course, for students studying civil engineering, fine arts or architecture, the concepts often seem a bit vague and difficult to relate with their interest.Alexandru & Alexandru will present their approach in teaching Internet of Things to power engineering students having no electronics and programming background. This talk will focus on the open source hardware and software solution that they built to enable students to use Raspberry Pi devices to control 3D printed wind turbines and power plants.

	00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,370
so hi everybody I'm Alexandre de vich I

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,200
am an assistant professor at the

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,500
Polytechnic University in Bucharest in

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,019
Romania my colleague here is one of my

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,570
ex students now a senior student at the

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,330
same University and another

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:20,039
undergraduate TA and he has more than 6

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,550
years experience in teaching and using

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,550
Linux

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,019
my main job at the Polytechnic

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,820
University is to teach computer science

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,840
in the computing computer engineering

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,860
department

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,129
mostly Linux operating systems and

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,250
programming a thought that has been

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,980
bothering my group for several years is

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,660
that computer science is kind of

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,300
becoming like mathematics it's not only

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,370
an own science but it's distributed in

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,949
every other field that you can find from

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,079
fine arts to mechanical engineering to

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,300
power engineering and all the fields

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,760
that you can imagine the same way that

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,180
we use math we will use computer science

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,670
for these fields and the question that

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,670
has been bugging us for years is how do

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,619
we teach this computer science or the

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:20,720
necessary knowledge of computer science

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:22,799
to these other fields so in the future

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,390
everybody will need something from

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,790
computer science it doesn't matter if

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,369
it's a car mechanics on a car or the

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,009
electrics on the car if it's an artwork

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,560
or a robot that moves or it's an

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,200
automation installation the engineers

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,350
and the builders of those devices will

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,200
have to have some basic knowledge of our

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,460
algorithms work and how software for

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,729
devices work so some minimal basic

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,070
knowledge for these things and this is

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,159
difficult and I will ask Alex which

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,189
studied programming devices to share his

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,290
knowledge his experience for this in the

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,110
third year at our university we have a

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,049
subject at which we have to build and

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,649
program a microcontroller so after 2

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,110
years of learning

00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:16,790
programming and advanced operating

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:21,530
systems we have to create a project for

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:25,640
for this board it took us several days

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:29,030
to to actually achieve this so on Linux

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,090
and Mac after a few tries it worked for

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,310
Windows it was even harder so it is

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,989
quite easy to understand why for most of

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,209
my colleagues this wasn't a favorite

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,299
subject now let's take a moment to

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,680
imagine how this would have been for

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,370
students with no computer science

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,629
background

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:50,629
I mean having to write embedded C code

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:53,690
and use advanced Linux commands in order

00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:57,560
to write the program on the board would

00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:00,650
have been next to impossible so to

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,340
tackle this ten years ago in Italy we

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,049
had a project that you know as Arduino

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:10,010
researchers that project decided to

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:12,650
teach the usage of computer science and

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,599
basic programming to people that have

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,609
nothing to do with it like fine artists

00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,410
and people that did electrical

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:20,900
engineering or just people that would

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,410
think and this project is known today as

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,269
Arduino what they actually did is they

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,230
they took the CPU or the microcontroller

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:32,769
that was most used in devices put it on

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,500
an embedded board for education and

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:38,239
built really easy to connect device you

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,159
didn't need any program or anymore you

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,109
didn't need a special cable all you had

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,510
to do is buy a USB cable

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:49,459
they built a really easy program to

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,650
write software for the arduino st

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:55,159
arduino ide from a computer science

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,199
perspective it's a really bad program

00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:01,040
like really simple and doesn't have code

00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,359
completion its Nandalal technology but

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,500
for somebody that does not do

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,840
programming every day

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,599
it was perfect one window copy paste

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,250
some code modify a little bit right on

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,069
the microcontroller and it worked and

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,269
this is why we have arduino today and

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:19,070
it's used in IOT so much the problem is

00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,709
I do you know is that's limited to

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,449
devices if you want to connect it what

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,340
we can very start

00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:28,250
so we can add a Wi-Fi shield or an

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,070
Ethernet shield but security is bad over

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,960
there second if you want to interact

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,440
with the Internet the C programming

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
language is a really big barrier so

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,759
Arduino is not that great for

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,210
connectivity so what about active

00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,970
devices we have the Raspberry Pi

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:49,669
disappeared somewhere in 2012 and it's

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,310
really easy to use if you use it as a

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,740
computer that means you plug in a screen

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,289
and the keyboard and start writing some

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,789
code it's super for kids it's super for

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:02,120
people that want to write a little bit

00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:05,360
of code but they use it as a normal

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,729
computer it's not a device and the

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,070
second problem that it has there's so

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:12,560
many languages that you can use so many

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,660
examples and if you need to hook 2 of

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,260
those examples together it becomes a

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,930
mess so if you want to build a robot or

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,750
device or something that sits on a

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,690
rooftop we can't connect the skin and

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,030
the keyboard and this is a problem so

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,699
transferring software to the Raspberry

00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,680
Pi becomes increasingly difficult

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:35,419
students need to know SSH need to know

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,590
networking need to understand an IP

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:41,449
address and some linux commands and

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,490
again alex will share his experience at

00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,190
one of our programs where we did teach

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,250
the Raspberry Pi this way actually in

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,620
the ninth grade I was part of an IOT

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,500
training it was my first contact with

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,440
embedded systems and it was pretty hard

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,780
like we had to find out the IPS of the

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,610
of the board's we had either to scan

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,340
down the networks for the IP either

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,860
connect an HDMI cable and a monitor to

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:11,000
find out the IP the boards kept changing

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,770
the IPS it was really hard and for most

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,590
of my colleagues which were high school

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,409
students it was their first contact with

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,970
a Linux terminal it was the first time

00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:23,659
they have seen a Linux terminal at that

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,180
time and another fact that we were

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:27,919
really scared of as people with no

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,810
computer science background was

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,770
connecting the sensors we were really

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,270
afraid of frying things so the computer

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,569
science engineers programming there as

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,909
we

00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:39,649
really easy we talked to several

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:42,080
universities they all said oh yeah it's

00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,240
easy we just ssh into it write some code

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,459
that's computer scientists that means

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,029
people that dream of this guy or this

00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:52,729
guy every day but people are not

00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:54,919
computer scientists they have a serious

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:56,839
problem in using the raspberry pi so

00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,969
myself I kept it on shop for a year

00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,429
because it was not clear use it as a

00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:04,719
computer use it as a device for a device

00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:07,610
okay how do you write code for it so

00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:10,189
inspired by the Arduino example we built

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,819
why live in studio this is a really

00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:17,209
simple user interface it's really simple

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:19,999
IDE for computer scientist it's too

00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:21,259
basic like just write some code but for

00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:24,709
people that are not in computer science

00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:27,319
they write a few lines of code click a

00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:30,019
button the program goes to the Raspberry

00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,519
Pi and it's executed it's not just for

00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:34,459
the Raspberry Pi can be used for any

00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,679
embedded device the most important thing

00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:38,990
that we learned in using this software

00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:40,909
was the one-click run so if they can

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,539
write the program and click a button and

00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:44,809
run it

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,839
students are super happy if they have to

00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:50,569
SSH have to copy the program install

00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,399
libraries run it manually computer

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:55,249
science students do it um

00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,349
others don't we encourage them to use

00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:01,249
Python as the Raspberry Pi foundation

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:03,860
does this and also we adapted blockly

00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:06,379
google blockly to write Python code for

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,689
them this has been particularly useful

00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:12,019
for students that have the first contact

00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:14,059
with the Raspberry Pi so when they start

00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:16,279
building more complex programs python is

00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:18,019
fine but for the first contact

00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:21,680
this was great they would just drag some

00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:25,539
blocks hit a run oh it works they could

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,029
also see the Python code on the side

00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:31,729
what we found out in six years of trying

00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:35,300
this piece of software and teaching IOT

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:37,990
to several fields is that there's three

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,729
categories of knowledge that they need

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,860
one is software for devices so minimum

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,610
programming skills minimum algorithmic

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,350
skills like if-else something like that

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,440
connectivity this means how to connect

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,810
devices to the

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,800
network to bluetooth and how to connect

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,880
sensors and peripherals to devices and

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,530
this is something that we learned the

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,270
hard way some basic security measures

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:08,460
most important change the default

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:10,800
password like we have a hackathon and we

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,690
hooked up some raspberry PI's never

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,580
bother to change the default password

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,230
we got hacked in five minutes I thank

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,210
you five minutes after connecting them

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,760
to the Internet we got hacked likewise

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,320
were completely deleted new software was

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,960
running on them and trying to infect

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,510
others so basic security measures like

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,060
change the password stop the SSH if is

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,590
not necessary this is super important

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,840
for students that are not in computer

00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:40,350
science on the connectivity side Alex

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,840
can show you another story one thing

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,550
that the students love about using the

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,680
the white or green studio was the fact

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,200
that you could or you could see in the

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,750
interface listed all the devices like

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,090
the IP address and another fact is that

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,970
you can change you can set a name for

00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:59,610
the Raspberry Pi so that if the IP

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,370
address changes because it happens you

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,330
can still find out which Raspberry Pi is

00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,460
yours

00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,440
because if you have a larger course and

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,140
you have at least I don't know fifteen

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
or twenty raspberry PI's connected

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,890
having no way to identify which

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,220
Raspberry Pi is yours it's a nightmare

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,470
and also another thing that the students

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,030
loved is that the fact that they can use

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,520
visual code like visual programming

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:29,340
because if they have no background on

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,320
writing code it really helps them having

00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,750
the software deployment issues solved

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,120
another issue that we had was connecting

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,670
sensors I cannot tell you how many

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,920
sensors we fried mostly for by polarity

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,170
inversion they just hooked them up in

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,170
the wrong way so what we ended up doing

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,870
I mean if you have one student it's fine

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,150
but if you have 20 or 30 students in a

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,700
class it becomes difficult we did a

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,260
board like this so we use the Raspberry

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,380
Pi did an extension board with some

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,410
growth connectors um it is impossible to

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,190
hook them up in the wrong way so for

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,650
students they were not accustomed to

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,420
tronics this was super I mean they were

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,380
just plugging cables they could not put

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,950
it in the wrong way

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,620
censors would just work so this is great

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:19,110
besides that we printed we 3d printed

00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:23,770
some objects like a stop sign or a house

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,180
or a windmill so the students could have

00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,460
a feeling of what they're doing that

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,020
just some sensors hooked up with cables

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,200
and okay this is the house but actually

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,600
it's not a house and they were really

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,320
really great for the energetic crew of

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,730
students

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,220
yeah courses another story that I have

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,140
was building a lab so scaling from three

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,600
students to 20 students or a hundred

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,310
students is super difficult one is the

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,320
problem of Alex said it was difficult to

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,540
find out the PI's second it was

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,240
difficult because students were kept

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,820
installing pro software on the PI we had

00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,210
to use the price for several courses so

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,320
what we started doing is a boot server

00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,780
finally the Raspberry Pi knows how to

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,390
boot from a network so we designed the

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,240
boot server they were serving the image

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,760
for the H has been a pipe teachers were

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,150
able to instantly install a package of

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,290
programs put it on the server students

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,720
would just come with while learning

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,840
studio connect to PI and the programs

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,670
were mounted on the PI so we did this

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,830
with a lab with of twenty students and

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:29,950
it worked great like we reduced the time

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:34,090
from starting the lab from 45 minutes to

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,860
about three minutes so this is the board

00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,320
that we designed we made it for power

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,210
engineering students students that learn

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,670
about nuclear power plants hydropower

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,680
plants relative power generation and

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,440
transmission they don't learn computer

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,960
science what they used to do before

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,630
having this lab they would program some

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,420
microcontrollers a was held for them I

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,830
mean nobody wanted the class they were

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,290
not dropping up because they can't they

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,839
have to take the class but it was not

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,210
their favorite after using the board's

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,750
the 3d prints while loading studio and

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,310
the visual environment most of the

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,350
students said it was one of their

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,820
favorite classes because it was the

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,420
first class where they saw they can

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,380
build something and even if it's this

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,360
device is not some

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,940
that they will use in the industry the

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,950
principles are the same because power

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,720
engineering students don't need to code

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,080
but need to have a basic understanding

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,060
of coding need to be able to modify some

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,060
PLC's and some code on some PLC's

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,860
because it was so successful the first

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,320
iteration of whether the studio was

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,730
built kind of organic like we need to

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,130
add this and then we need to add this

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:49,510
and ok let's say what about this one and

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,730
became a spaghetti code so we made a new

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,550
version of the wild living studio which

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,490
is the same easy-to-use IDE it's focused

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,220
for IOT so connecting to devices hooking

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,990
up devices and it's easily easy to

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,080
extend it's basically a collection of

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:09,100
plugins adding a new device or a new

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,390
board is super easy for the moment this

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,220
is these are the boards that we've

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:18,070
almost already support the application

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,040
comes in two flavors either a local

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,450
application either web application this

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,400
was funny we started with the web

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,840
application because it was easier for

00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,210
students they didn't have to install

00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,430
anything anything and then we did some

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:33,640
trainings in Germany like five years ago

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,340
and we found out it's illegal for

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,860
students to have accounts on a third

00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,710
party server mostly for high school

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,560
students so what we have to do we have

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,840
to somehow make a local application so

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,180
that's why we have the local application

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,640
you just download it the story projects

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,770
locally everything is fine for the web

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,830
application is still easier to use a web

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,440
application we have a new principle we

00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,570
store it in your local storage so now if

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,060
your data goes to a servers everything

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,980
is locally stored it's fully gdpr

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:10,540
compliant which in Europe is a big big

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:15,610
issue and yeah no account no name just

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:19,030
use it in the browser visible most of

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,360
the browser's that you have today it's

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:26,020
open source it's free it's written in

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,350
JavaScript if mostly for electron or for

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,350
the browser

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:34,240
but we need your help I mean it's an

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,760
open-source project so we would love to

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,260
have more contributors to it we're

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,769
hoping to have the code better

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:45,459
documented than the first version and we

00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:47,170
will do the next in an extensible way we

00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:49,899
would love to have more translators I

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,630
mean we have about seven languages that

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,430
we translated in but we need more

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,320
because for students it's super

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,899
important to have it in their own

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,579
language and of course because it's a

00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,970
free project we are looking for sponsors

00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:06,250
I mean we do this in our free time and

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,100
it would be great if we could actually

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:13,149
do it more professionally um thank you

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,310
very much that's the website that's the

00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:18,490
github repository and we have a

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,610
technical showcase at 5 p.m. where you

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,089
can actually try it out if you have any

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,089
questions

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,950
well thank you

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,090
