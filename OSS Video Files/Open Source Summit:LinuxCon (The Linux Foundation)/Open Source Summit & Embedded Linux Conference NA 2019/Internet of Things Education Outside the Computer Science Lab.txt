Description: 
	Internet of Things Education Outside the Computer Science Lab - Alexandru Radovici & Alexandru Vochescu, Politehnica University of Bucharest

Internet of Things is now part of many high-schools or universitiesâ€™ curricula. While for computer science students, this is just another regular course, for students studying civil engineering, fine arts or architecture, the concepts often seem a bit vague and difficult to relate with their interest.Alexandru & Alexandru will present their approach in teaching Internet of Things to power engineering students having no electronics and programming background. This talk will focus on the open source hardware and software solution that they built to enable students to use Raspberry Pi devices to control 3D printed wind turbines and power plants.
