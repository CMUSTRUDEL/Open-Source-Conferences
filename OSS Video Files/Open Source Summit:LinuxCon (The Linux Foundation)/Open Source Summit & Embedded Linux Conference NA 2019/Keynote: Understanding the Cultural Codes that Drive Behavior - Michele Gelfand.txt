Description: 
	Keynote: Understanding the Cultural Codes that Drive Behavior - Michele Gelfand, Distinguished Professor, University of Maryland and Author of “Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire the World” Over the past century, we have explored the solar system, split the atom, and wired the Earth,but somehow, despite all of our technical prowess, we have struggled to understand something far more important: our own cultural differences. Using a variety of methodologies, my research has uncovered is that many cultural differences reflect a simple, but often invisible distinction: The strength of social norms. Tight cultures have strong social norms and little tolerance for deviance, while loose cultures have weak social norms and are highly permissive. The tightness or looseness of social norms turns out to be a Rosetta Stone for human groups. It illuminates similar patterns of difference across nations, states, organizations, and social class, and the template also explains differences among traditional societies. It’s also a global fault line: conflicts we encounter can spring from the structural stress of tight-loose tension, and our data show that they have important implications for success in international mergers & acquisitions and expatriate adjustment, and can also help to explain some of today’s most puzzling political trends and events. An understanding of this template can help us develop more empathy and to bridge out cultural divides.

	00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,140
good morning and I want to start my talk

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,940
with a story about two fish and these

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,389
two fish is swimming along one fine

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,370
morning

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,040
and they passed by another older fish

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,100
who says to them hey boys how's the

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,350
water and they swim by swim on and then

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,410
one of them turns to the other and says

00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:24,539
what the hell is water and this story is

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,099
pretty simple but has a profound point

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,680
which is that sometimes the most

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,500
important realities around us are the

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,260
most difficult to see and for fish

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,530
that's water but for humans

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,570
that's culture and culture is really

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,510
interesting puzzle because it's

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,750
omnipresent it's all around us all the

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,550
time 24/7 but it tends to be invisible

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,770
we take it for granted we don't think

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,750
about it it's also something that's

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,670
distinctly human there's no other

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,660
species that has it to the extent that

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,699
we do and it also is really important in

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,820
terms of affecting everything around us

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,180
from our politics to our parenting from

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,030
our nation's to our neurons what's

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,310
interesting is that we as humans have a

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,680
lot of technical competence we put a man

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,650
on the moon we've wired the earth we

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,009
discovered the laws of gravity but what

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,360
if we can discover the laws of culture

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:23,580
what if we can move beyond superficial

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,950
types of distinctions like red versus

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,689
blue and east-west or rich and poor to

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,939
understand the deeper cultural codes

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,369
driving our behavior then we might be

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,920
able to collaborate better in context

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,650
like this and even build a better world

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,270
for all of us so as a cross-cultural

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,210
psychologist I've been studying hundreds

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,460
of cultures over the last 25 years from

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,100
ancient Sparta to Singapore from the

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,189
Aztecs to Alabama from the military to

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,049
single Silicon Valley and as you study

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,579
culture around the world and in

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,740
pre-industrial societies you see a lot

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,079
of different contrasts puzzle and

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,930
contrast for example you go over to

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,490
Singapore which is aptly called the fine

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,740
country because there's so many

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,049
punishments you can get from chewing gum

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,690
to not flushing the toilet in public

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,200
places or is it even walking naked in

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,940
front of open curtains in one's house

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,190
and I know a lot of you like to do that

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,530
so I'm just warning you about that if

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,180
you take a quick ride over to New

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,160
Zealand you'll see very different kind

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,890
of behavior see people walking barefoot

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,990
in banks and in many places on college

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,900
campuses you see people burning couches

00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,870
and New Zealand is the only place that I

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,360
know of that has his own national wizard

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,760
so this dude actually was a fired

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,200
professor from Australia who landed in

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,750
New Zealand and was lecturing on

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,850
everything from rugby to religion in

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,890
city streets and instead of punishing

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,050
the deviant the prime minister of New

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,360
Zealand asked him to become the National

00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,970
wizard and his job was to entertain the

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,920
country if you go around the world you

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,050
see other puzzle and contrasts why for

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,420
example in Germany do people tend to

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,790
wait patiently on street corners even if

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,790
there's no cars around whereas my own

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,940
beloved state of New York people jaywalk

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,739
incessantly with children in tow in

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,110
Germany some cities are trying to now

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,820
incentivize this behavior you might not

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,820
notice but this guy here is actually

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,930
playing a game of street pong and

00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,970
actually he's playing with a dude across

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,620
the street and a real game I've actually

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,989
talked to the owners of this company and

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,340
in fact they show when the lights about

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,750
to change which helps people to stay

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,150
entertained while they're behaving

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,650
themselves but on more serious note why

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,200
is it the case that in some countries

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,810
you can smoke weed openly including the

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,489
United States in some places in other

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,040
contexts you can get the death penalty

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:43,220
for the same behavior closer to home

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,959
what explains puzzling trends like why

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,720
are we giving our babies more and more

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,459
unique names as an aside one of my

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,200
colleagues in New York went to a store

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,350
and asked where the candy was and they

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,610
said she doesn't work there anymore and

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,040
why are we getting fatter and fatter

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:01,010
over time is there anything that helps

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,720
us to tie these examples together and I

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,250
would say that there is and these

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,890
examples reflect something really

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,640
fundamental about culture that is to say

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,650
how strictly we abide by social norms

00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,200
all cultures have social norms these

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,970
unwritten rules behavior and the

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,519
something that we follow constantly

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,610
we're expert as humans in developing and

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,770
enforcing social norms in fact we neck

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,550
really recognize how much we need social

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,840
norms in order

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,090
predict each other's behavior and

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,190
coordinate I want you to do a little

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,050
thought experiment and try to imagine a

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,550
world where people are driving on both

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,690
sides of the street and not paying

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,810
attention to stop signs

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,639
okay that's New York but imagine a world

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,889
where you walk into restaurants which

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,389
are open whenever and people are chewing

00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,710
with their mouths open and they're

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,509
belching loudly and they're stealing

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,150
food off of each other's plates

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:52,129
okay that's my family household or

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,780
imagine you walk into an elevator and

00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:55,190
people are facing backwards and they're

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,050
factually shaking umbrellas on each

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,759
other I encourage you to try to do that

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,530
see what kind of looks you'll get in

00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,090
this world imagine that sex is not

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,340
reserved for private settings people

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,800
have sex on buses on airplanes and in

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,569
contexts like this luckily humans

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,240
develop social norms in order to avoid

00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,620
these situations societies families

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,810
organizations would collapse without

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,360
social norms it's the glue that keeps us

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,190
together but what I've discovered over

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,530
some years of research is that that glue

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,870
tends to be stronger in some context

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,090
than others this is what I call tight

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,219
cultures and they have strong norms and

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,469
punishments for deviance like in

00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:32,599
Singapore and we contrast that with

00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:34,009
cultures that are brucer that have much

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,319
weaker norms that are much more

00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,180
permissive and it turns out that this

00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,940
distinction of tightness can explain a

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,830
lot about the world I first started to

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,150
study this with a large team of

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,740
scientists I put together around the

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,599
world the results of which were

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,449
published in science a few years ago and

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:52,219
just like we can classify individuals on

00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:55,130
personality dimensions we can also

00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:57,409
classify whole countries in terms of the

00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,930
strength of their norms tight loose is a

00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:02,779
continuum what we found was that some

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,969
cultures like Japan Singapore Germany

00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,860
Austria Switzerland tended to be

00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:09,229
airtight even though they have some

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,569
loose elements on the flip side places

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,610
like New Zealand Brazil the Netherlands

00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,490
tend to veer loose even though they

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,990
might have some tight elements what we

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,759
also discovered in this research is that

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,370
there's a really distinct trade-off that

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,279
tightness gives to groups and that is

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,779
basically order versus openness so when

00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,250
our data what we could see is that type

00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:30,139
cultures tend to have a lot of order

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,960
they have much less crime and more

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,729
monitoring for example and actually

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,279
there's a really funny show that many of

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,120
you might watch on NPR wait wait don't

00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,160
tell me

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,470
recent episode Peter sagal is asking

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,300
people what a Japanese police officers

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,639
need more of and we're all guessing

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,949
maybe they need more pay maybe they more

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,740
vacation time there is Austin turns out

00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,780
that they need more crime Japan has one

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,610
of the lowest crime rates on the planet

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,470
and apparently some police officers were

00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,060
so bored they were egging people on to

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,690
try to commit minor crimes or certain

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,330
cities type cultures also have a lot of

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,729
uniformity and synchrony you find that

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,410
people wear the same clothes they're

00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:11,600
more likely to drive the same cars and

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,450
even you see this uniformity in city

00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,889
streets on clocks and I analyze city

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,169
clocks around the country around the

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:20,300
world and what you find is that in Thai

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:22,070
cultures city clocks basically are very

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,410
highly aligned they're very synchronized

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,540
they're off by maybe milliseconds but if

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,130
you go to lose cultures like Brazil and

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,960
Greece you're not entirely sure what

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,030
time it is because the clocks all say

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,560
something different finally type

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,539
cultures also have a lot of self-control

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,370
when you live in a context where there's

00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,169
potential punishments you need to manage

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,539
your impulses and you're taught from a

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:43,100
very early age to manage those impulses

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:45,110
and that has a lot of consequences for

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,510
societies type cultures have less

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:51,139
obesity they have lower debt they've

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:54,050
less alcoholism lose culture struggle

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,760
with order they have less synchrony they

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,490
have more crime and they have a host of

00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,190
self-regulation problems they even have

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,889
fatter pets like my beloved Portuguese

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,800
water dog but loose cultures corner the

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:08,599
market on openness there tend to be much

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,789
more open to different people different

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,099
religions different races people of

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,810
different stigmas I showed this in one

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,400
study I did where I had my research

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,039
assistants go around the world to 20

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,050
different countries wearing fake facial

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,510
warts so I bought them for them off the

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,250
internet you can do that or they were

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,900
wearing tattoos and nose rings and the

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,789
simple question was if they go around

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,530
city streets in their home countries and

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:32,000
they ask for directions they're asked

00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,940
for help wearing these ridiculous things

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,310
do they get help and we found the data

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,630
were pretty clear it's in loose cultures

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,190
that they're much more likely to get

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,229
help where they're much less likely to

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,430
get help in tight cultures loose

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,740
cultures are lots more open to different

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,720
ideas the more creative they're also

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,070
more open to change our computational

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,050
models show that when you introduce a

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,279
new norm or to lose cultures it takes

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,230
off much more quick

00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,740
so you could see that in this case type

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,149
cultures struggle with openness so the

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,250
question is what produces these

00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,470
difference in the first place there's no

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,690
common geography or religion or

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,570
tradition or language that unites Titans

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,339
cultures so what predicts it turns out

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:13,279
is a pretty simple principle and that

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,709
has to do with threat threat can be from

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,449
mother nature think constant disasters

00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:19,339
and famine like Japan a struggle with

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:21,079
over the course of its history threat

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,389
could be from other humans think

00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,630
constant invasions or the spread of

00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:28,820
pathogens or even really high population

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,579
density cultures that have a lot of

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,529
threat need stronger rules to coordinate

00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:35,420
to survive they need that stronger glue

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:38,209
and we've shown that in computational

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,949
models we also see this in data that we

00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:42,260
collected across a hundreds of years

00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:44,060
across these different countries type

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,130
cultures have more food deprivation more

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,870
territorial threat they have more higher

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,089
population density even dating back to

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,519
1500 there greater chronic natural

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:55,220
disasters and more pathogens loose

00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,970
cultures have less threat generally and

00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,350
they can afford to be more permissive

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,300
this can help us to explain this

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,220
puzzling issue around why you can't chew

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,949
gum in Singapore which from an American

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,449
point of view sounds preposterous but

00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:11,029
actually when you think about it

00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:12,769
Singapore has 20,000 people per square

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,750
mile that's an astonishing amount of

00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,250
people compare that to Brazil where

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,290
there's 50 people per square mile and

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,360
more sheep per capita than people in

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,430
contact with this high population

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,100
density you need strong rules in order

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,600
to coordinate an or void chaos and in a

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,120
place where there's so many mouths per

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,740
capita gum was causing a serious problem

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,420
people will chew gum and they like to

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,220
throw on the ground and apparently it

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:38,170
was causing a very serious mess in the

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,640
late 80s it was causing sensors to be

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,260
getting blocked and having lots of

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,420
problems with trains and elevators so

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,149
finally Lee Kuan Yew said guys we're

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,889
gonna have to ban this tasty treat it's

00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,380
the simple solution in a place that has

00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:52,639
a lot of threat and if we accidentally

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,010
were born in Singapore we might agree

00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,839
with that as well once you start

00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,209
thinking about tight and loose you can

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,640
see it in a lot of different places for

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:03,649
example instead of red vs. blue we

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,200
published a paper recently in PNAS that

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,600
we

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,670
we calculated how we can think about our

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,380
differences what we found was that the

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,840
south and some aspects of the Midwest

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,330
tended to be airtight the coasts tend to

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,600
veer looser this is distinct from other

00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,070
types of dimensions a conservativism and

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,200
also you see remarkable resemblance

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,880
between this map and the amount of

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,830
natural disasters that we see in the

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,530
United States as well as other

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:31,560
indications of threat like pathogens and

00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,810
food scarcity at the state level we see

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,000
the same order versus openness trade-off

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,340
in our data we can see that tight states

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,500
have more conscientiousness more rural

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:44,940
orientation they have more order and

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,380
have more self-control tight states also

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,500
according to our analysis are more

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,780
polite and this explains why my beloved

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,320
New York City in New York State which is

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,880
ranked number one on rudeness has met

00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,980
many problems when going to the South

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,870
New Yorkers like to flip people off we

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,700
see this kind of affectionate gesture I

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,260
would not recommend that doing that in

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,520
the polite context of the South because

00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,670
I have some stories in my book about

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,070
this loose culture struggle with order

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,870
in the state level but they also gain

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,280
counter the market on openness they have

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,710
more creativity they have more tolerance

00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,430
and even if they're more rude they tend

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:21,750
to be more fun according to surveys once

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,790
you start thinking about these you can

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,530
start zooming into States and one

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,630
interesting area has to do with social

00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,010
class often it's time we think about

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,180
differences between the working and

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,460
upper class in terms of our bank

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,110
accounts but actually we have the idea

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,270
that maybe these deeper cultural codes

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,910
are also driving some differences across

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:41,730
class lines I want you to think for a

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:44,190
moment about this phrase followed the

00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,930
rules if I give you that phrase what

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,900
just comes up in your mind what words

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,640
and phrases come from your mind this is

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,960
something that we did with many

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,730
different people from the working class

00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,250
and upper class all around the country

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,750
and we found striking differences across

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,150
these groups and how they make meaning

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:03,270
around this very phrase for the working

00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:05,760
class they found very positive nature of

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,610
this kind of phrase offering words like

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,500
good structure safe the upper class

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,150
participants in our studies have very

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,660
different more negative views like

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:16,980
nuisance goody-two-shoes in fact if you

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,150
look at American bookstores you see a

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,980
lot about break

00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,540
we tend to be a culture that celebrates

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,310
that best definitely comes from this

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,980
kind of middle and upper-class mentality

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,839
when we measure these kinds of

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,279
attributes in these classes we could see

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,980
that they really differ on tight and

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,330
loose and it makes sense again the work

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,589
in class tends to experience a lot of

00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,260
threat they're worried about falling

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:38,820
into hard living or poverty they go to

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,430
occupations that tend to have more

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,200
danger where rules help keep people safe

00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,600
and they live in neighborhoods where

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,180
rules can help kids stay out of trouble

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,320
the upper-class has more of a cushion

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,480
and they can afford to be more

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,820
permissive and can afford to break the

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,710
rules sometimes in fact that's what some

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,029
studies out of you California Berkeley

00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,860
show when they measured what kind of

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:00,990
cars break the rules including cutting

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,000
off pedestrians what they found was that

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,860
it was the upper-class cars like BMWs

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,620
and jaguars that cut people off much

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,270
more as compared to Palmer vans I hate

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,400
to say this because I Drive a BMW and

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,700
it's I think the car has a mind of its

00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,080
own we we also see although the upper

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,940
class tends to break more rules they

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,320
also have the same order openness

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,630
trade-off we saw and other levels of

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,570
analysis they tend to more tolerant but

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,339
any more creative what's astonishing is

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,900
that we see these differences very early

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,940
this is a study that we did with

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,260
three-year-old kids in our lab we

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,940
brought in working-class kids and

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,130
upper-class kids into our laboratory and

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,320
we can't exactly ask them what do you

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,150
think of rules but we can have them

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,680
interact with a puppet this is max the

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,170
puppet and they're playing a game with

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,850
Max the puppet and all of a sudden max

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,620
starts violating the rules of the game

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,930
it starts announcing that he's playing

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,640
the game correctly and what we can do is

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,910
videotape these kids and see how they

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,220
react when Max becomes a norm violator

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,630
turns out that working-class kids are

00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,100
much more likely to tell him to stop

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,810
doing his do what he's doing and it's

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,240
more of upper class kids who have been

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:06,080
socialized even by age three to let max

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,760
off the hook even laugh at his behavior

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,910
even in our own organizations this

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,350
distinction of tight loose is very much

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,750
important in terms of the kinds of

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,339
behaviors that we see as normal we know

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,440
that for example loose

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,060
tight organizations tend to have that

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,580
same sense of order and predictability

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,130
strong training alignment in people's

00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,400
mental models people who are prevention

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,350
focused on boarding mistakes these tend

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,640
to live in industries where rules should

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,230
be

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,940
important where coordination is really

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:38,330
important like manufacturing Hospital

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,160
Airlines and also these contexts as I

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,740
mentioned makes sense because they have

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,200
greater threat loose organizations have

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,640
a very different ecology they tend to

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,040
have much more flexibility and

00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,990
experimentation more informality less

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,240
monitoring more promotion focus if not

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,280
some impulsivity they tend to operate

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,220
and live in industries like startups and

00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,470
tech and these contexts have much more

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,110
safety and less threats so it makes

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,280
sense these organizations and units

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,840
within them also have very different

00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,280
leaders we've studied leadership and

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,320
tighten loose cultures and we can see

00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,880
that people across many different

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,880
countries and across thousands of

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,740
managers we ask them what attributes

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,390
contribute to effective leadership they

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,190
have very different responses for tight

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,830
cultures people want autonomous leaders

00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,750
who call the shots loose cultures like

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,210
people who are charismatic and her team

00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:29,090
oriented so you could see that the

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,490
people and the practices and the leaders

00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,800
that are running these shows are very

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,480
different in titans cultures and it

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,400
causes not surprisingly a lot of

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,860
conflict within organizations and

00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,210
between organizations in a recent paper

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,730
that I published in Harvard Business

00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:46,310
Review we actually documented the price

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,960
tag in cross-border acquisitions for big

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,360
differences in tight loose across those

00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,640
organizations it's remarkable because

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,170
often companies don't do that due

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,790
diligence to understand what's the

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,100
cultural DNA that we're really buying

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,650
into and they only later stumble into

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,820
that iceberg without realizing it and I

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,380
could say that in the biggest

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,760
differences we can see a reduction in

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,329
our way in over two hundred million

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,390
dollars so the question is which is

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:14,150
better tight or loose by show of hands

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,770
who would vote for tightness there's

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,720
always a lot of people also who would

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:22,550
vote for looseness who's gonna abstain

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,100
okay so this is a fascinating question

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,470
that has occupied us for many many

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,850
centuries should we organize groups to

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,030
have a lot of freedom or a lot of

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,380
constraint Plato Confucius Hobbes who

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:36,170
had a very negative view of humans

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,330
thought we need rules then you have John

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,390
Stuart Mill and Freud who is kind of

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,820
crazy think that rules make you neurotic

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,480
and we should have more freedom so which

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,210
is correct after centuries of three

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,130
where is the data well we wanted to look

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,220
at this question and our hunch was what

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:56,220
if it's neither what if to type and

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,840
Toulouse is maladaptive surely groups

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,540
need to lean tight Moo's for good

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,610
reasons evolutionary reasons but what we

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,919
were intuitive was that as groups get

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,480
too extreme either too loose where

00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,770
everything's chaotic and you can't

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,169
predict each other's behavior like we

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,540
talked about very early in this talk or

00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,970
too tight which is really repressive

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,530
maybe that's where the problem is and

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,100
this is what we call the Goldilocks

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,900
principle of tight loose Goldilocks of

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,880
course is that silly little storybook

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,790
about not too hot not too cold not too

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,799
soft not too hard what about if we put

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,200
this principle to social norms in our

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,419
own lives and sure enough we could see

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,730
this curvilinear pattern across many

00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,559
different data points to tight and to

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,299
lose cultures have higher depression

00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,870
they have higher suicide that higher

00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,730
blood pressure they have lower happiness

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,200
this Goldilocks principle as I talked

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,750
about in the book applies not just to

00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,179
organizations and to nations at prized

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,470
Rhone households we know that parents

00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,690
that are too tight who are very

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,090
helicopter-like or parents who are too

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,809
laissez-faire cordia's let their kids do

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,970
whatever produce maladaptive kids in a

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,980
recent pink cast that I did with Dan

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,679
pink I talked about in two minutes

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,390
my approach to trying to negotiate tight

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,460
loose in the household how do you

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,830
achieve that you try to negotiate which

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,450
domains need to be tight and which need

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,700
to be loose this is something that can

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,950
is eminently negotiable and that's what

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,660
I want to end my talk on is how do we

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,330
think about achieving tight lose balance

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,100
in our own lives because this is

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,960
something that we invented social norms

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,370
we can actually negotiate them we can

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,790
identify contexts where we need to

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,650
tighten loose norms we need to also

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,500
identify contexts where we might need to

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,330
loosen tight norms that have become

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,120
maybe maladaptive this is what I call

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,400
tight loose ambidexterity the best

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,590
leaders know how to balance tighten

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,440
loose in their companies even when it

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,360
comes to innovation innovation requires

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,970
both tight and loose it requires

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,490
looseness to create new ideas but Inc

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,690
really requires tightness to implement

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,179
those ideas on a large scale

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,979
oops that can't manage those dualities

00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:05,289
don't tend to be as innovative and we

00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:09,489
have data on that again curvilinear

00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:11,019
effect when I talk about Titleist

00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:12,700
ambidexterity we have some specific

00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:14,889
prescriptions of how leaders can

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,229
actually help produce this kind of

00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,749
balance in some cases we need to tighten

00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:21,999
up loose organizations that perhaps have

00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:24,729
not been organized and have too much

00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:26,830
disorder in this case we need to

00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:29,229
centralize and have more monitoring and

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,239
emphasize reliability except benchmarks

00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:32,919
is what I call structured looseness we

00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:34,869
don't want to lose the looseness in this

00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,599
context but we might need to inject some

00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:39,039
structure on the flip side there's many

00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,479
times we may to loosen a tight

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,519
organization this is the context of

00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:44,139
Airlines or manufacturing where we do

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,779
want rules we don't want people doing

00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:49,330
crazy things in Airlines but we might

00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,700
have gotten to rule oriented I wrote an

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,649
op-ed about United Airlines we want

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,570
United Airlines to have rules but

00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:57,820
arguably a couple years ago people were

00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,679
following the rules blindly and we need

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,529
to loosen up in that context and non

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,869
safety domains in this case we need to

00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,210
decentralize encourage pushback and

00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:09,340
exploration promote individual agency

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,349
something I call flexible tightness and

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,269
United actually has been doing that they

00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:15,299
don't call it that but that's what we

00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:18,909
can do in organizations where we need to

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:22,059
create more balance so I'm just going to

00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:24,399
end with one final slide and that kind

00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,539
of gets back to the sense of self of how

00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:27,909
can we use this in terms of

00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:30,519
understanding our own mindsets because

00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:33,460
each of us falls on the continuum of

00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:36,340
veering tight or loose truth be told I'm

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,200
moderately loose husband is a lawyer he

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,820
veers moderately tight we've been

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,710
married 25 years we seem to be able to

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,989
manage it but we have a lot of conflict

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,359
over tight loose when it comes to things

00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:47,950
like parenting when it comes to finances

00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,109
when it comes to messiness around the

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,849
house I talk about that in the pink cast

00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:53,529
so you can hear about that but the

00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:55,840
important point here is to first of all

00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:57,429
do a self-assessment on my website which

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,649
is at-michelle Golf and calm you can

00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:01,149
take a type moose mindset quiz and think

00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:03,429
about where you fall on this continuum

00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:06,460
even if we change by situations we each

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:08,470
tend to have a certain default are you

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,409
for example am up order Muppet or a

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,460
Chaos Muppets many of you will remember

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:14,259
Sesame Street

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,230
you have people like Burt and Kermit

00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:19,360
who've your tights Burt or and Kermit

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,619
Kermit likes to collect paper clips and

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,869
other things like that and they like

00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:24,850
rules they like to control their

00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:28,299
impulses they like structure they crave

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:32,499
structure chaos Muppets among us are

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:36,669
people like Cookie Monster and Ernie an

00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:39,309
animal who don't tend to notice rules as

00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:42,070
much we might not manager impulses maybe

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,619
have some impulsivity we also enjoy

00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,720
ambiguity we can we can accept ambiguity

00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:48,279
once you understand where you fall on

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,350
this continuum naturally it helps to

00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:52,240
illuminate and empower us to understand

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,919
ourselves and also can help us to

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,389
understand the kinds of complex we have

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,999
with our co-workers or spouse our

00:22:55,389 --> 00:23:00,669
neighbors our in-laws number one answer

00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:03,879
on vacations is tight lose conflict in

00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:06,909
that context so we can start thinking

00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:08,889
about how other people are on this

00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:10,629
continuum and why might they have

00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,309
evolved to be the case there's usually

00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:15,100
good reasons why people fear tight or

00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,200
loose and ultimately we can then start

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,869
negotiating tight moose conflict in our

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,840
own daily lives so I want to thank you
