	Connect IoT with RSocket - Andy Shi, Alibaba

RSocket is an open-source reactive networking protocol that is designed to handle the challenges of communication between complex networks of IoT and cloud services. Based on the Reactive Streams specification, RSocket is able to handle typical request-response traffic as well as bi-directional streaming data â€“ even in the face of unreliable connections.RSocket is transport-agnostic, so it can be used with a variety of standard transports (like TCP, HTTP/2 and WebSocket) both within the data center and over the internet.In this talk, I will introduce the concept of RScoket. And demonstrate with broker deployment model, how RSocket makes the IoT connection easier and more secure. In particular, I'll discuss how RSocket simplifies service discovery and bi-directional communication.
