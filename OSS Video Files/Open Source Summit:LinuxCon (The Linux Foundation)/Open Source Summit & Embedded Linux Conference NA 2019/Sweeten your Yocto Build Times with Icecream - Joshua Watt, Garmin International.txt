	Sweeten your Yocto Build Times with Icecream - Joshua Watt, Garmin International

When building complex embedded systems with Yocto, a considerable amount of time can be spent waiting for builds to complete. One method of accelerating these builds is to use a distributed compiler such as icecream. Joshua will discuss the current state of icecream support in Yocto, pros and cons of using icecream, typical configurations, as well as tips, tricks, and quirks he has learned from using icecream for the past 2 years.
