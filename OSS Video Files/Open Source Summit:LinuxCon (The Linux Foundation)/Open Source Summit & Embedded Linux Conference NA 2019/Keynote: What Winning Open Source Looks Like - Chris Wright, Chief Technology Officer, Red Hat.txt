	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,279
well good morning and I'm pretty stoked

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,670
to be in San Diego unfortunately it's

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,690
only for a few hours but that's life

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,790
I'm I'd like to talk today about open

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,789
source Jim did a great job this morning

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,800
of describing how open source is just

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,900
fundamentally changing the industry I

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,990
call it the innovation engine for the

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,789
industry and it's not just creating

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,320
technology but it's helping entire

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,939
industries just to transform and

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,790
completely change how they operate how

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:38,489
they do business and that's really

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:41,790
amazing open source to me starts with a

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,320
shared vision you can't really

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,309
collaborate on something if you don't

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,730
know what you're working on together

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,020
shared vision I think is key

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,730
obviously collaboration is a big part of

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,059
what we do so that's working together to

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,590
achieve this shared vision to me and a

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,879
critical component in this is trust as

00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,949
community members were people were

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,870
humans we're developing human trust

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,939
relationships with each other trust

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,770
comes with openness and transparency I

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:12,330
think it's a really fundamental part of

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,710
what we do when we build a community my

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,740
favorite part of an open source

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,040
community is the ability to just get

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,710
stuff done and it's I call it initiative

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,290
and what that means to me is showing up

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,340
and doing something is valued it doesn't

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,049
matter where you come from it doesn't

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,430
matter your background a contribution of

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,780
code documentation bug reports creating

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,240
community meetups all of these things

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,400
are important parts of the community and

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,180
all that is required to do that is

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,860
initiative and showing up another

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,049
important part of a community to me is

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,470
diversity I think diversity has a couple

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,880
of dimensions one is the people so make

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,790
sure we have the broadest different

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,159
kinds of ideas and and and mindsets

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,750
represented the other from a more

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,820
technical point of view is the types of

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,000
problems that we solve so a great

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,219
project I think that sustains itself

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,079
over time is capable of supporting a

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,680
diverse set of workloads or different

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,220
problems

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,989
I think another key hallmark for

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,620
open-source is the notion of incremental

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,870
improvement

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,099
whether it's fail-fast and realized that

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,709
that's not working or whether it's

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,150
release earlier release often you know

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,069
you hear more and more about it today

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,470
and in differing worlds whether it's

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,360
DevOps and agile development or whether

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,909
it's ways that whole organizations are

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,129
thinking of operating themselves not

00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:34,519
just building code so I think that's a

00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,680
really important piece it's gets more to

00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:41,340
organic growth and evolution some of

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,280
what you saw earlier with the the poet

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,769
example and I think this is a really key

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,470
feature of open source development

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,480
communities so ultimately together I

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,790
think we're building a diverse community

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,230
to write and maintain software to solve

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,190
problems that users care about it sounds

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,650
pretty simple and well we've done an

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,720
amazing job of that and so what you

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,819
heard this morning was a bunch of

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,290
examples of how the industry are

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,799
changing the industry is changing

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:13,140
fundamentally you look at a place like

00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,489
github which has something they label

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,069
themselves as having over a hundred

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,139
million get repositories over 40 million

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:20,730
developers and two plus million

00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,370
organizations there that's those are

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,930
staggering numbers you look at some key

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,019
large projects and the number of changes

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,060
per day and the velocity of activity

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,120
that happens within those projects this

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,579
is all staggering and typically Jim

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,769
talks about the the billions of dollars

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,639
of transactions that are supported

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:40,530
through all of this open source

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,079
development so you get the sense of the

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,879
real commercial impact you didn't get a

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,989
chance to hear that today but one of the

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,449
things that I think is important is

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:53,669
realizing that part of winning is with

00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,699
great power comes great responsibility

00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,829
like we have we've done a lot and I

00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:02,790
think we have to make sure that we

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,799
continue to evolve throughout all of

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,530
this change and maintain some key

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,660
features like that transparency and

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,510
Trust and incremental improvements on

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,989
organic growth as these key tenets of

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:19,400
how we operate together so along the way

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:22,710
what's changed I would say fundamentally

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,260
and and I say this with intention to

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,450
create a visceral response

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,120
it's the corporatization of open source

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,500
now is that a positive or negative I

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,600
don't know maybe it's up for you to

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,030
decide the positive is all of that

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,020
amazing industry impact that we're

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,630
seeing the negative I think is how do we

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,390
onboard a whole new set of constituents

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,460
both contributors and users into a world

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,800
that we have really evolved over the

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,090
past decades personally I've been

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:58,860
involved for about 20 25 years so this

00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:01,170
this is a long time in coming so we have

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,970
a whole different set of dynamics

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,710
these are industry-wide dynamics there's

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,320
a lot of money at stake which changes

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,780
people's behaviors and I think we should

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,490
be able one to acknowledge that and to

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,080
really be mindful about how we carry

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,060
forward to ensure that the core

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,540
qualities of open source sort of

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:21,690
withstand the test of success I think

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,270
success also you see that kind of great

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,640
responsibility understanding from a user

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,610
point of view what a project delivers is

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,160
important and you and we we just learned

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,310
about another type of vulnerability with

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,010
the the issue with rubygems

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,330
this kind of high profile security

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,860
concerns is something that will continue

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,960
to matter hugely to the industry we're

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,730
we're impacting and changing the entire

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,890
industries we need to make sure we do

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,240
that in a responsible way and help help

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,130
people who are trying to use our

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,290
software to consume that safely another

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,000
piece that I like to point out is

00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,710
there's a fundamental distinction

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,510
between a project and open-source

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,610
project community based development

00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:09,350
effort and a product of commercial

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,460
effort may be fundamentally one is about

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,910
community creation it's about the

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,380
technology it's about really evolving

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,210
bringing features on into a software

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,100
platform and evolving that platform

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,710
architectural II soundly so that you can

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,450
sustain it over time not necessarily

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,640
creating a commercial relationship with

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,550
the user certainly having relationships

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,560
with users is important on the prod on

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,540
the product side there's all these

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,420
things about lifecycle management and

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,650
stability that that's independent from

00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,610
the upstream lifecycle there might be

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,800
integration around other products and

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,020
ultimately clarity of when we're talking

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,789
about a project and when we're talking

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,080
about a product I think will be really

00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,810
helpful for people who are trying to

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,759
consume what we're building and

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,930
understanding where it's in the bleeding

00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,009
edge and not yet mature and

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,960
understanding where it's actually a

00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:02,900
commercially supported variant of an

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,789
open-source project another area that's

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,740
related to this is certifications and

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,810
there's a bunch of different meanings

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,189
for certifications I think this is an

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,819
example of blurring the lines between

00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:15,169
the commercial side of software activity

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,419
and the community side of software

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,129
activity protecting the trademark around

00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,930
the software project is really important

00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:24,110
because we have brand association with

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,819
the quality of a project understanding

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,409
when you're doing certification to

00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,240
conform with the trademark versus

00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:31,759
certification to say this is a

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,979
commercial activity and I know in my

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,599
role I get requests from customers to

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,639
say give me one of those and they're

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,289
point out a certification stamp which

00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,000
may or may not be relevant in the

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:42,889
context of a commercial product so I

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,990
think that's a blurring of the lines

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,550
between the community and the community

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,250
development efforts and the commercial

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:54,860
side of creating and selling supporting

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:57,460
software so to me I think the challenge

00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,589
ahead is really keeping those those core

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:03,339
values as core tenants of what open

00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:06,620
source is thinking about how we create

00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:09,319
projects sustain projects when we work

00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,589
with in foundations understanding the

00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,469
difference between the marketing hype of

00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:17,270
hyping a project and the reality of what

00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:19,400
a project is capable of so that we're

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,319
level setting with with the industry

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,029
what's what's real and what's you know I

00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,759
think we do doing ourselves a disservice

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:28,490
to overly hype sophomore projects before

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,830
they're really ready and mature and to

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,390
me this is the the fundamental kind of

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,459
interesting challenge that we have I

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,839
would call it open source 2.0 or next

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:36,919
generation open source if I was in

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,649
marketing and trying to give it a

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,570
buzzword and a slogan I suck at that so

00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:43,969
I'll just say I think we're entering a

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,560
new era of open source it's not today

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,570
it's not as if it wasn't there yesterday

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,670
but we're we're moving into this new era

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:54,110
of open source and I actually have some

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,940
concerns that if we don't

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,279
attention to these things and work

00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,630
together as a broad community that we

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,970
could lose sight of what's made us

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,149
successful and transition into a new

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,589
space where we lose those same core

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:09,890
capabilities and maybe lose some of that

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:12,140
amazing success so I'd love to continue

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,149
the conversation certainly there's

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,680
Twitter and there's hallway tracks and

00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:18,320
if we get enough people who are

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,910
interested in this type of discussion we

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
could carry it on and make it a more

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,550
formalized discussion and that's really

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,810
what I wanted to share with you today

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,790
thank you very much

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,790
