	Finding the Best Way to Use Linux Kernel - Status Update - Tsugikazu Shibata, NEC

Linux is the default choice of modern IT system including IoT, Embedded and many others. For IT system, historically, commercial distros are providing distribution with security and bug fixes in Long Term. That has a huge number of continuous testing and fixing in backside to provide professional support.On the other hand, Embedded space is very different. Every company needs to roll up their own distribution by themselves with picking the best kernel and evaluate it on their own. Sometimes it will be the duplicated effort even we are using Open Source.LTSI had been established to find a way to solve such issue and continued to advocate using LTS kernel.I will present kernel development process with the latest statistics to find the best recommended LTS kernel with surrounding community situation.Then, I will cover what is happening for Linux testing activities. Also, cover Open Source Licensing topics which should be known for the people using Linux for their products.
