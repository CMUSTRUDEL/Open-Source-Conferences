	Assessing Project Risk Using CHAOSS Metrics - Sean P. Goggins, University of Missouri & Jessica Wilkerson, Linux Foundation

Measuring individual, group, and organizational performance is a complex, layered endeavor. This session is framed to describe the challenges and opportunities for measuring the health and sustainability of open source software projects stemming from the first two years of the CHAOSS[1] project’s operations. In particular, this session will focus on one of the CHAOSS project’s areas-of-interest to develop: Project Risk.This Session Focuses on CHAOSS Risk Metrics Focus Areas:1. Security: Understand security processes and procedures associated with a project.2. Code Quality: Understand the quality of a project's source code.3. Licensing: Understand the potential IP issues in a project.4. Transparency: Understand what dimensions of the project are visible organically or through metrics; or, in contrast, what is not visible but should be?5. Sustainability: How active is the community around a given project?[1] http://chaoss.community
