	Static Partitioning Made Simple - Stefano Stabellini, Xilinx

Static partitioning is used to split an embedded system into multiple domains, each of them having access only to a portion of the hardware on the SoC. It is key to enable mixed-criticality scenarios, where a critical application, often based on a small RTOS, runs alongside a larger non-critical app, typically based on Linux. The two domains cannot interfere with each other.This talk will explain how to use Xen for static partitioning. It will introduce dom0-less, a new Xen feature written for the purpose. Dom0-less allows multiple VMs to start at boot time directly from the Xen hypervisor, decreasing boot times drastically. It makes it very easy to partition the system without virtualization overhead. Dom0 becomes unnecessary.This presentation will go into details on how to setup a Xen dom0-less system. It will show configuration examples and explain device assignment. The talk will discuss its implications for latency-sensitive and safety-critical environments.
