	News from the Embedded GFX Space - Robert Foss, Collabora

The embedded GPU space is seeing rapid changes with the introduction of new standards like Vulkan and new applications like VR and wearables.This of course affects the GPU hardware and what we expect from it, which in turn means that the software ecosystem is seeing a lot new demands placed on it. From low latency output of VR to power optimizations of wearables.New standards like Vulkan also have a large impact on the software stack, with some implementations going as far as implementing legacy standards like OpenGL on top the Vulkan stack.This presentation will look at the different GPUs and provide an outlook their Linux support, including a comparison of drivers provided by the vendor against the one provided by the Linux Community looking at the benefits and disadvantages of each of them.
