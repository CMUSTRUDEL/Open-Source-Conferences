happy Friday everyone um this is my

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,570
first time presenting at a conference so

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,340
hum a little nervous but you know what's

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,009
get started

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,070
my name is Kyra quasi it is such an

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,279
honor to be with you this week I still

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,369
can't believe that I was I was invited

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,859
to speak at this conference I bet so

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,480
many inspiring people this week it

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,570
showed me that there's so much for me to

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,480
warn okay

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,910
Oh what'll bit about me and why I'm here

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,079
earlier this year the Linux Foundation

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,430
contacted me after the San Francisco

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,770
Chronicle feature mean an article today

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,399
I'm ten years old I am a sophomore in

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,289
college

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,140
and I started college when I was lying

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,149
I'm triple major in math computer

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,559
science and possibly physics if I can

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,620
squeeze in all the credits I'm I'm also

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,660
proficient in over 312 programming

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,710
languages and I've earned three

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,900
certifications in deep warning and

00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,150
possibly the coolest thing ever I spent

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,939
this summer as a research mentee with

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,549
Intel labs with the anticipatory

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,220
computing lab of Intel ABS where the

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,799
team is developing several game-changing

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,650
AI technologies my team is currently

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,619
working on cutting-edge AI capabilities

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,650
to support people with disabilities my

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,479
mentors give me so much hope for careers

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,210
in technology that also have a big

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,490
mission I have hope that in my

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,040
generations lifetime we will witness the

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,220
infinite possibilities of AI to

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,869
revolutionize our socio-economic

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,979
institutions and deliver equity to

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:50,280
marginalized communities at Intel labs

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,020
my weave mentor is Wallman Othman she's

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,340
an Intel fellow and director of the

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,439
anticipatory computing lab in 2012

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,259
huama with a team of researchers to

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,479
develop a new software platform and send

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,570
things his stump to help the wait dr.

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,300
Stephen Hawking communicate Wow

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,979
imagine working with Stephen Hawking

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,380
giving the world a chance to hear his

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,160
voice and access his thoughts it's like

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,810
a dream however the team also realized

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,660
that there was an unaddressed need in

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,130
the space they saw a need for an open

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:29,160
and configurable platform for the first

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,900
of communication a new type of system

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,450
that researchers and developers can

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,350
build upon to bring new innovation and

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,900
help more people gain access see the

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,520
issue today with assistive communication

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,940
platforms is a the economies of scale

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,530
don't work relatively speaking the

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,840
number of people with disabilities is

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,610
not that large and more importantly

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,310
solutions needs to be tailored to each

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,370
specific case as you can't just use the

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,570
same solution for everyone this so this

00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,790
is why these assistive communication

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,190
systems end up being very expensive

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,650
think thousands of dollars per unit

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,640
this makes them inaccessible for many

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,410
people so the Intel team decided to

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
build a configurable platform and

00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,820
release it to open source this way

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,070
people can easily build on top of it and

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,920
customize the system to the specific

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,690
needs of each person an open-source

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,790
platform makes it much easier to build

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,340
tailored systems for people with

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,540
different needs

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,070
it had the assistive context-aware

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,410
toolkit is a software platform that

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,080
enables people to access their Windows

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,060
applications with a simple trigger that

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,700
can be mapped to any muscle movement

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,910
well graphical user interfaces are easy

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,950
to understand and are very intuitive if

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,100
you can't move a mouse they become a

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,989
nightmare essentially you're scanning a

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,320
2-dimensional space searching for a

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:59,010
point oh you really want to do is choose

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,989
one option out of many if the computer

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,050
can track your gaze this becomes easier

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,280
but for many that's not an option

00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:09,180
certainly for Stephen Hawking that

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,670
wasn't an option at all so an ache at

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,940
many functions are automated and served

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,850
as options to select from menus whether

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,060
it's opening a file

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,230
from the web or giving a lecture etc etc

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,060
you get my point

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,310
um depend on the context of the

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,440
application the appropriate contextual

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,230
menu surface to reduce the reliance on

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,670
the mouse developers can easily build

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:37,940
new menus for new applications it can

00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:41,600
also supports many languages to enable a

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,690
new language people people can translate

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,760
the menus and train the appropriate text

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,120
corp the tipping train a language model

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,220
with the appropriate text corpus after

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,400
working closely with dr. Stephen Hawking

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,260
for seven years to discover appropriate

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,120
solutions for people with disabilities

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,780
many different functions were built to

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,310
support them and since different people

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,290
might be able to access different

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,580
muscles and cap supports many different

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:12,260
sensors a cheek sensor ring sensor the

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,590
assistive switch which is just a push

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,320
button

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,510
um developers can easily add new sensors

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,140
in just a day to tailor the system

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:23,090
further and one of the cool things that

00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,210
I rectoress was the brain computer

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,300
interface an amazing thing about this is

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:32,630
that if a user can't move any muscles to

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,820
trigger a sensor then BC I can still

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,690
read their brainwaves and use that as a

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,170
trigger into a tap in the current

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,640
version a cat was used in two ways the

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,980
word prediction system and the

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,980
perception system if you're using camera

00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,900
or BC as a sensor however while this

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,940
allows people to communicate and speeds

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,200
up typing in traumatic week because they

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,750
only have to type the first few letters

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,480
and then rewind word prediction it's not

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,370
fast enough if you spoke to Stephen

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,820
Hawking or any other person using

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,920
assistive computer you will know so long

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,060
pause after you say something before

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,010
they finally end up responding this is

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,230
because forming these sentences whether

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,890
you're using gays or anything else is

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:21,500
still very tedious so the project that I

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,140
worked on was using a cat or AI in a

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,600
different way what if we wasn't what the

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,710
other person was saying converted it to

00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,410
text using ASR and then tried to predict

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:37,630
what the user might say and serve them

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:40,010
as options if they can choose or modify

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,740
this will truly start to feel like a

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,320
real conversation and the beauty of this

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,500
is that as the user continues to use the

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,510
system the system will warn from

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,180
previous examples and continue to

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:56,000
improve over time this is the promise of

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,890
true human AI collaboration where I can

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,220
bring the best out of both sides and

00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:06,710
help disabled people thrive and not just

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:09,320
cope it can has the potential to change

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,470
the lives of people with ALS and other

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,630
motor neuron disabilities as we add new

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,620
features we are making a cat more

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,870
dynamic more iterative and easier to use

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,360
this in turn makes it more accessible it

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,060
is my fervent belief that in the near

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,910
future technology like a cat will be

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,880
sophisticated enough to help people to

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:35,229
help people with physical challenges and

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,229
disabilities with more independent lives

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,680
okay that's right I'm just checking on a

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,090
final note I would like to say something

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,370
personal I'm standing here today only

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,510
because people in influential positions

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:52,460
took a chance on me they changed my life

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,890
as result I have had the chance to

00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,100
appear on numerous television shows and

00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:00,140
publications and share my story with

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,300
people around the world the

00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,729
administrators of my college could have

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,740
looked at me and said no while my

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,440
Loughran and until ads could have looked

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,970
at me and said no without visionary

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,090
readers who are willing to use their

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:19,550
influence to create opportunity for

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:22,100
equity what happens to kids like me well

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,020
forced to fend for ourselves in a world

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,480
that ceases no more than our age

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,460
I implore you today

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,100
please take a risk on people who don't

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:35,900
fit in in the entire box please use your

00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:38,660
influence to say yes to someone um

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,410
please look out for my future and fall

00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:44,270
issue of the MIT Technology Review also

00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,610
please follow my youtube channel where I

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,770
discuss issues in science and current

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:53,030
events I need one thousand subscribers

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:54,800
so please help me get there you can also
