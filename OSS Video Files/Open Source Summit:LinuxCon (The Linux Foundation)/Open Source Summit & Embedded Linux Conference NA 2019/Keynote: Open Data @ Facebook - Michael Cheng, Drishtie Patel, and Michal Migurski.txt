hey folks my name is Michael Chang I am

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,799
on Facebook's open source team I'm gonna

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,849
kick this off by doing a quick

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,200
introduction to our open source program

00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,360
you may be familiar with some of our

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,539
more well-known projects including react

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,320
and react native which is the front-end

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:27,390
framework for web and mobile PI torch

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,550
for ml graph QL for AP is in terms of

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,460
numbers across the company our open

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,460
source program supports more than 500

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,790
projects which have received a combined

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,899
total of 300,000 contributions from

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,899
16,000 contributors our open source

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,350
program also sits within a broader

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,530
ecosystem of initiatives that seek to

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,239
address and focus on some of the

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,030
difficult problems more difficult

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,420
problems that we face both as a company

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,329
and as a society and that includes

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,920
Facebook connectivity which aims to make

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,170
the internet more accessible to

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,890
everybody on the planet Facebook AI

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,479
research which engages in AI and ml

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,990
research across a broad range of

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,240
disciplines both of which regularly make

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,299
most of the tools data and information

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,909
that we use and generate Pupp available

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,360
for public consumption and that is why

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:31,020
earlier this year together with Google

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,140
and uber Facebook announced the urban

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,659
computing foundation which we see as a

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,630
compelling platform for organizations to

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,810
get together to address the impact of

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,040
technology on urban landscapes even

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,860
though the ucf is brand new Facebook has

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,979
been active in the geo data space for

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,990
many years and that is for both

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,719
humanitarian reasons and for our data

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,909
creation purposes here to talk about two

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,829
examples of that is my colleague Mike

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,930
Barsky who will talk about disaster maps

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,860
and also Tristan Patel who will talk

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,330
about OpenStreetMaps Mike thanks Michael

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,160
hi everybody my name is Michael mikorski

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,830
I'm an engineering manager at Facebook

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,660
in the spatial computing group we're a

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,730
group that largely deals with questions

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,340
that start with the word we're and we

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,670
perform a lot of mapping and geospatial

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,870
data services within Facebook myself am

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,060
i calling drift you're gonna talk about

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,770
two of those efforts today and I'm gonna

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,680
focus specifically on a project called

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,930
disaster maps which we were running for

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,430
approximately the past a year or so and

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,110
I'll talk about sort of what disasters

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,740
are in the context of a project like

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,360
this who's interested in those and who

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,730
around the world cares about mitigating

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,640
disasters and then finally what we at

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:53,240
Facebook are doing to play a role in

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,220
that ecosystem this is an aerial image

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,990
of the campfire from November of last

00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,700
year up in Northern California

00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,440
it happened just a few hundred miles

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,120
northeast of the Facebook campus and

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,450
actually blanketed my first week at the

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,830
company in thick dangerous smoke but it

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,960
was much much worse for the people on

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,240
the ground in Paradise California the

00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,340
town most affected by this 85 people

00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,990
lost their lives

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,790
19,000 buildings were destroyed many of

00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,740
them single-family homes it was the

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,410
single largest wildfire in California

00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,090
history most destructive wildfire and we

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,010
think that this is indicative of a very

00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,920
large number of similar crises that are

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,660
increasing around the world at this time

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,700
cyclones hurricanes earthquakes all

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,560
these kinds of events we think are being

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,390
exacerbated by the oncoming climate

00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,280
crisis and we had Facebook are

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,410
interested in participating in some sort

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,510
of response to this but there's a lot of

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,430
folks that are already out there

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:46,040
responding to crises from first

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,220
responders such as fire departments all

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,020
the way out to a large cluster of

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,290
organizations that perform relief

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,710
activities during and then long after a

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,330
crisis hits a community and what are

00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,820
some of the concerns that these folks

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,620
have well they're really trying to

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,730
answer several critical questions when

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,890
they're looking at response either

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,870
immediately during a crisis or a while

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,280
after first of all they just want to

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,410
know what areas are affected this is a

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,500
core geospatial question where is the

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,330
actual problem second they're interested

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,340
in the human impact they want to know if

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:22,060
people are evacuating where they're

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,639
going where they're coming from

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,230
has power or connectivity been disrupted

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,310
these are important concerns for people

00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,710
who use mobile phones to communicate

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,729
which is basically all of us so you have

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,290
to know things about power and

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,120
connectivity in order to understand

00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,620
whether folks are able to talk to their

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,840
friends families loved ones that kind of

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,430
thing and then finally if people leave

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,949
and don't come back do they settle

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,449
someplace else where might that be we

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,790
know from the Hurricane Katrina disaster

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,830
in 2005 that many people just left New

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,300
Orleans for good at that point and so

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,669
part of the response to that disaster

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,199
involves understanding what that kind of

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:57,790
human geography and human landscape

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,290
looks like over the long term some of

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,500
the organizations that we partner with

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,910
are these there's about 30 of them and

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,590
they have a lot of different concerns

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,110
Direct Relief is a large organization

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,570
that performs sort of direct delivery of

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,500
relief supplies into hard-hit zones of

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:16,360
crisis I DMC's focuses on internal

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,360
displacement monitoring essentially

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,699
internal refugees within countries net

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,070
hope is one that focuses on network

00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:27,310
connectivity so they bring network and

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:30,070
cellular hardware to areas where network

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,410
has been disrupted and use that in order

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,580
to re-establish cell phone communication

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,740
so that people impacted by a disaster

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,880
can continue to contact and communicate

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,710
with people outside of the area all of

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,030
these are organizations plus dozens more

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,870
the partner with Facebook on the

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:49,180
disaster Maps efforts and so what can we

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,830
do about this well Facebook happens to

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,660
have access to a lot of information

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,729
about how people move around the world

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,590
especially from folks who share their

00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,860
location with us via the Facebook mobile

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,510
application and others and so if you can

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,550
have access to this information and run

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,710
it through important privacy protections

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,419
such as anonymization to ensure that

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,849
nobody's individual information is

00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:13,090
accidentally released the addition of

00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:14,800
random noise to help mask further the

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,320
individual identities or movements of

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,000
specific people spatial smoothing to

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,950
blur out information so that you're

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,810
looking at kind of neighborhood and town

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,030
scale data rather than individual house

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,760
scale data and finally the removal of

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,289
small counts in order to kind of

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,460
attenuate the amount of information

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,710
you're giving out about very under

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,360
populated rural areas all these things

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,530
together add up to of

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,199
valuable source of information that many

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,539
of those partners on the previous slide

00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,090
use in order to respond to disasters

00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:46,430
more effectively so what form does our

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,169
help take well there's kind of five

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,300
types of mapping that we provide to

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,490
these organizations those of you who are

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,409
familiar with face book safety check

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,330
know that it's a way for people to

00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,460
essentially let their friends and family

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,319
know that they're okay in a disaster but

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,360
we kind of tail on to that and start

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,120
providing data in areas impacted by

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,370
safety check one type of map that we

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,889
provide to disaster responders is a

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,889
population map very simple map showing

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:15,169
broad change and patterns over space and

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,419
time of how the Facebook user population

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,879
is moved so this map is showing us

00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,800
paradise California which is primarily

00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,689
affected by the campfire last year as

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,610
well as neighboring towns like Oroville

00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,990
Chico and willows and what you can see

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,509
from this map is that there's a kind of

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,669
blue cooling effect people leaving

00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:34,610
Paradise California who used to be there

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,650
and a red kind of growing effect in

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,210
places like Chico and Orville so one

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,190
organization like Direct Relief might

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,919
look at this and say okay it's realistic

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,020
that the folks who need n95 masks or

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,310
other relief supplies might be found in

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,409
chico since they're not going to be in

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,789
paradise during this fire so this might

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,699
be an important hint that they use in

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:54,229
order to direct relief efforts we

00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,120
produce a type of map called movement

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:58,550
maps this is something a little bit more

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,319
precise whereas the previous one gives

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,629
you kind of large absolute numbers of

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,270
population change movement Maps gives

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,099
you kind of unusual movements even if

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,110
they're very small scale so if there's

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:11,000
40 people you know who normally move

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,500
between point a and point B and then

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,389
during this disaster you're seeing a few

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,879
hundred people do that move it'll show

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,740
up as a thick line on a map like this

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,870
which might a does that might help a

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,770
disaster responder understand that

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,860
that's where they should focus their

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,250
energy zooming out a little bit we're

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,169
also thinking about large scale and

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,759
long-term displacement so these types of

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,529
maps will show that for example people

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,419
might have left paradise California and

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,610
settled with friends or family and other

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,949
towns or rented apartments elsewhere or

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,449
just picked up and gone to a different

00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:43,069
state this is important for

00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:45,079
understanding what the kind of long-term

00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:46,970
population dynamics in these hard-hit

00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,649
areas are

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,600
and then the last two maps really focus

00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,480
on the kind of technology dimension of

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,660
disaster response so because we know

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,670
kind of big patterns about how Facebook

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,380
is used on mobile phones we can start to

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,380
infer things like network coverage maps

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,720
this is extremely useful for NGOs like

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,850
like net hope for example who might want

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,260
to patch holes in network coverage it

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,360
might also help early responders

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,070
understand where they're not seeing

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,930
information maybe there's not coverage

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,490
in a particular area and that might be a

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,290
hint that that's a place they might go

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,550
look and see if there's people there who

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,180
aren't showing up on some of the other

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:26,240
maps and also due to the behavior of

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,060
kind of charging devices and powering up

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,040
Android devices we're able to also infer

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,110
broad patterns and power availability by

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,089
making inferences from essentially

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,709
battery level so this might help us

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:38,540
understand in a remote area whether

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,390
there's a power outage to an area hit by

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,660
a hurricane or an earthquake or similar

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,580
so these five types of maps are the core

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,790
of Facebook disaster maps they're a

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:53,410
privacy protected way for us to share

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:56,089
broad aggregate user patterns with

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,680
responding agencies and NGOs that need

00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,029
to be able to get to these populations

00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
and understand what they're gonna see

00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,270
when they get there

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,950
but there's a sixth type of map which I

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,420
haven't talked about which is basically

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,390
what is the actual existing

00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,430
infrastructure like roads and land use

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,810
and so forth in those areas and so I'm

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,730
gonna hand it over to a colleague of

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,230
mine Drishti Patel also in spatial

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,850
computing we'll talk about how we work

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:22,970
with the OpenStreetMap community on that

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:24,650
six type of map Thanks so I'm thirsty

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,200
taken over from Michael and Michael over

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,630
here and I'm gonna be talking about maps

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,820
at Facebook so a lot of you might be

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,079
wondering where we even use maps at

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,970
Facebook and how it kind of all ties in

00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:40,220
trends out high-quality maps are really

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,930
valuable to our users and they're

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,360
actually used across a variety of

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:48,800
products so you can see here in examples

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,720
of search conness events travel some of

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,430
the humanitarian causes that Michael

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,029
mentioned as well as even things like

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,520
looking for a job our base map at

00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,089
Facebook mostly consists of data from

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,339
open

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,100
map how many people are familiar with

00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:07,009
OpenStreetMap alright perfect this is an

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,860
open source community so that's not

00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,839
surprising at all but basically

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,059
OpenStreetMap is a free and editable map

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,389
of the world that's largely built by

00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:19,910
volunteers which is pretty amazing so

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:22,850
think Wikipedia Fujio it powers

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:26,420
thousands of map data websites mobile

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:29,930
apps and hardware devices and over time

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,930
it's gained a lot of usage in various

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,170
sectors traditionally data collection

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,699
for Open Street Map was pretty manual

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,850
and this includes tracing satellite

00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:44,269
imagery data collection from mobile

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:47,360
devices as well as GPS devices a lot of

00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,189
just really hobby mappers putting their

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,160
GPS device on bikes and actually

00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:54,680
tracking things over time and also

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,040
low-tech field maps which is something

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:02,120
that still happens today so collecting

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:04,699
data by hand as you can see in this map

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,800
even though osm has all of these amazing

00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:09,259
benefits and has grained adoption in

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,509
various sectors there's still a large

00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:13,429
part of the world that is in Matt and

00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:16,129
you can see very clearly in these areas

00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:18,230
where it's highlighted in pink these are

00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:20,240
not under populated areas of the world

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,149
they are high population high dense

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,879
areas but a still lacking significant

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,309
math data and in some places there's no

00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:31,910
data at all showing that people exist in

00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:34,399
those areas data collection is complex

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,809
it's difficult especially in some of the

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
more rural parts of the world where

00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:39,589
there's no power there's no connectivity

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,420
you're written with political and

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,459
environmental constraints to go around

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,459
and do this work and so it's very hard

00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:50,300
to scale up into these different sectors

00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:52,309
and areas of the world so this is why

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,870
Facebook has been doing some research to

00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:56,749
try and figure out what are the ways

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:59,600
that we have that we can speed up this

00:12:56,749 --> 00:13:02,269
process in improved data coverage and

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,220
filling these missing gaps one of the

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,259
benefits that we have inside at Facebook

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,620
is all of the power that we have around

00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:11,370
AI and machine learning things that have

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,020
helped us get there

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,330
that has changed in the industry as well

00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,060
as access to heist resolution satellite

00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,520
imagery is much easier you can basically

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,170
bite with a credit card and then there's

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,480
been really major advances in deep

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,910
learning and you can see in this image

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,380
right here these are basically two

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,810
different data sets that are currently

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,480
open at Facebook the yellow that you see

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:37,410
is actually a high-resolution population

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,270
layer and it's available on season and a

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,680
couple of different open data spaces

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,680
where you could just download this data

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,660
and use it for whatever you want really

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,820
and then the white roads that you're

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,940
seeing are the roads and that's what I'm

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,960
gonna focus on today so you can see in

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,240
this image this is an image of Jakarta

00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,480
Indonesia when I've pretty much the most

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,310
highly dense urban areas in the world

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,690
and over the past two years there's a

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,730
team at Facebook that has been working

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:08,490
to improve this model and so we can

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:11,370
extract features from satellite imagery

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:14,040
at a global scale and that's the magenta

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,350
layer that you're seeing showing up and

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,630
because we've made this training data at

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,690
home the model actually works across

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,520
various terrain types and this is what

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,770
you can see in the example in Ethiopia

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,720
where the colors and textures all look

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,630
different but the model still still

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,300
works pretty well this is another

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,120
example of Nigeria a more hilly kind of

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:40,880
rural area as well it seems to be doing

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,880
okay and can anyone guess where this is

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,660
so this is Boston where our engineering

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,630
team for this actually sets and you can

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,000
see it does pretty well in urban city

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,560
areas as well this tends to be easier

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,140
because you know there's a much more

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:04,170
like defined patent for these areas so

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,480
now that we have these models at global

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,070
scale and you have roads for whole

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,780
country what does that really mean how

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,880
can you really get it into the hands of

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,580
the community and so this is what we've

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,560
been thinking through as well so there's

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,570
an editor called the ID editor that was

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,290
created by map box that is open sourced

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,430
as well that we took in-house and kind

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,590
of expanded on

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,740
first to test things out of how can we

00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:30,480
get this vectorized data back into the

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,630
hands of the community and making sure

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,740
that we keep the integrity of osm good

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,350
as well because we don't want to do

00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,240
these massive changes over time because

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,580
it is a really community driven project

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,680
and so essentially we used what was

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:47,160
already available expanded on it and

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,580
then allowed users to access our AI data

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,350
through current tools this tool is now

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,970
open because we spent a lot of time

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,010
testing it working with local

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,070
communities making sure it was okay over

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,330
the past year and it is now fully open

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,340
sourced and you can find it on the

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,040
Facebook incubator under the tool named

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:08,550
rapid which is what we're calling the

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,080
Facebook version of ID so secondly we

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,570
also partnered up with humanitarian

00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,520
OpenStreetMap this is also a huge part

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,580
of the OpenStreetMap community a task a

00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,520
manager that essentially lets ngos of

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,740
various types and sizes come and create

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,310
tasks for humanitarian projects and this

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,900
is everything from long term health

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:31,140
programs or development projects to

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,940
disaster response and people all over

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,220
the world usually in the thousands

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,740
usually show up to help map these areas

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,380
during the times of crisis and so we've

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,350
worked to create a tasking manager that

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,680
is ml enabled so it allows people to

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:48,660
access all of this AI data from various

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,150
places it doesn't necessarily have to be

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,310
Facebook and integrate these tools into

00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:55,710
the tasking manager and so in the time

00:16:53,310 --> 00:17:00,060
of disasters they can access this data

00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:01,620
in a more easy and efficient way lastly

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,270
to make all of this kind of works

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,360
seamlessly because we're running our

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,209
models on specific type of imagery we've

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,920
parked it up with max R and this is the

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,720
vivid layer that we work off which is

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,100
pretty much the mosaic the most recent

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,810
mosaic they have of the world that

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,540
stitches everything together nicely and

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:21,900
so it's free of cloud cover this is also

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,910
available on Open Street Map as you can

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,260
see and the image that we're showing is

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:29,340
actually the place we're at right now

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,140
and lastly this is kind of the

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,200
walkthrough of what this would look like

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,960
for a use

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,870
so essentially you would select a task

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,390
on the toski manager open it up an ID

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,490
which this is a very typical user

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,620
workflow we're gonna start off by

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,570
showing what happens when an editor

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,570
manually draws you would pick a point

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,540
line or area feature go through and make

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,299
the edits manually by clicking nodes and

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,190
then go ahead and tag the features to

00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:00,070
whatever appropriate tagging it would be

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,440
the other option is using the rapid

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,480
workflow so essentially when you open it

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,510
up all the roads are already available

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,280
and and then you would just basically

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,280
add it to the graph if you wanted to use

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,380
it you can add the different feature and

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,150
then go ahead and add the tags as you

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,660
can see one of the other things we've

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,820
added into our version of rapid are lots

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,549
of validation and data integrity checks

00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,500
so users get real-time feedback if

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:28,690
there's something wrong with the data if

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,250
you're drawing a road over a building or

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,350
the connection doesn't make sense we

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,720
have suggested edits and warnings and so

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,910
people can get real-time feedback and

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,320
train because most of the people that

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,840
are doing this mapping are completely

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,400
remote and usually may not have someone

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,510
around for guidance so this real-time

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,179
feedback is really helpful so getting to

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,580
the heart and soul of OSM is these local

00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:54,150
communities all around the world that

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:57,220
basically self-sustained set up and

00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,900
choose to map up their roads it's really

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,640
amazing you'll see some of the countries

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,350
and if you look at the user edits it's

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,360
pretty much one or two people that have

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,400
built out entire highway systems for

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,440
their whole country and all of this is

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,630
on a volunteer basis so in addition to

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,150
whatever else they're doing in life so

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,880
so it's absolutely fantastic to see all

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:18,190
of this stuff happening and we've teamed

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,110
up with these local tea groups all over

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,030
in different regions to figure out

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,830
what's the best way to collaborate not

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,540
just throwing tech out but figuring out

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,880
the most efficient way to work with them

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,530
and this is an example of the work we've

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,570
been doing in Indonesia we teamed up

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,270
with the local mapping team and

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,860
Indonesia recently and what we found is

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,650
that even when there's very strong

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,110
communities it's really helpful to have

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,970
some of the digitizing done already

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,320
because they get to spend more time on

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,910
the

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,160
information that you can only captured

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,600
on the ground for example telling what

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,360
type of bridge it is whether it's

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,480
something I can walk on or drive a car

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,920
on or maybe may not be good for travel

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,630
at all these are the kinds of

00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,230
information that you can only get on the

00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,140
ground

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,180
so lastly I'm going to leave you with a

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,250
video that basically summarizes this

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,910
process which was also an example of

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:11,070
Thailand all of this is now open sourced

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,900
and available and we're gonna end off

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,470
with some links later on so you can find

00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:18,640
it but yeah I will just get that started

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,730
thanks
