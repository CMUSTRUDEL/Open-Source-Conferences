morning everyone good morning welcome to

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,859
San Diego the weather is beautiful down

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,780
here and I'm from the Bay Area you know

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,509
just a couple hour flight and it's like

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,330
40 degrees warmer in particularly in the

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,660
summer down here but it's amazing we

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,449
have a great three days for all of you

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,449
this week open source summit and the

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,060
embedded Linux conference is a great

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,890
event there's so many different people

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,929
here from different projects and

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,149
communities one of the things I

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,640
encourage all of you to do is really try

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,879
and talk to somebody who may be working

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,890
on a technology or a project that you're

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
not necessarily familiar with and I'm

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,100
gonna show you in a minute why that's

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,500
important but I think that's one of the

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,570
best parts about an event like this is

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,610
you have such a broad representation of

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,739
people who are working in technologies

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,750
that may be adjacent to each other but

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,629
might not actually know each other that

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,910
well but before I get started I of

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,710
course want to thank our sponsors first

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,030
I want to thank our diamond sponsor

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,850
Intel let's give them a round of

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,680
applause our platinum sponsors the cloud

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,420
native computing foundation Google IBM

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,840
in Red Hat let's give them a round of

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:21,509
applause but most importantly I want to

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,180
thank the chairs and program committees

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,280
for doing all the work

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,460
trying to sort through all the different

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,630
talks and choosing the ones that they

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,630
thought would be best for this

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,990
particular event it's a lot of work and

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,659
these folks do it so well I won't go

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,920
through and read every single name here

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,720
but I think I went through this this

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,490
morning I think I know all of you and

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,979
again I just want to thank every single

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,600
one of the folks but who do all this

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,030
work let's give them a huge round of

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,049
applause

badges or just go to the website URL

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,120
located there a few other things that I

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,310
wanted to mention is some of the

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,090
diversity and inclusion initiatives that

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,750
we have this week today we're hosting a

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,150
women in open source lunch at 12:55 at

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,970
the Vella restaurant if you haven't

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,860
signed up already for that please do and

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,280
we also have on Thursday a speed

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:04,080
mentoring program at 2:20 p.m. that is

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,090
on the elevation on floor 30 so also if

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,080
you haven't done that I haven't

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,810
registered please do that now I also

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,269
want to do a quick reminder about our

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,640
code of conduct its prominently

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,580
displayed any of our staffs can refer

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,130
you to it but essentially all attendees

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,380
should be feel welcomed and included at

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,959
this event if you have any questions at

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,049
all please contact any of the people

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,989
wearing a staff badge or shirt and they

00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,810
will be able to help you out as well so

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:40,950
with those housekeeping notes I thought

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,070
I would kick off this year's event with

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,799
a cool video about an open source

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,900
project here at the Linux Foundation so

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,710
let's just roll this quick video before

00:03:48,900 --> 00:04:01,810
we get started

00:03:50,710 --> 00:04:03,700
[Music]

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,430
every single part of the filmmaking

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,510
process is touched by software and a lot

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,930
about software it is open-source

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,120
software the Academy Software Foundation

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,280
exists to provide a great home for open

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,389
source projects that we as an industry

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,389
use every day

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,049
[Music]

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,060
whether you are a user of open-source

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,039
software or an engineer or our company

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,930
that relies on open source software we

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,159
want to create the right D Co system for

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,330
you to get the most out of the open

00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:11,949
source software that you need to use

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,419
find us at a s W F dot IO and join the

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:26,710
mailing list and see how you can get

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:28,629
involved how cool is that sixteen years

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,479
ago if you had asked me if an

00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:35,560
open-source project would have Spider

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:36,970
Man Iron Man Robredo who's the president

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,009
of Industrial Light and Magic and is the

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,099
chairman of the Academy Software

00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:45,270
Foundation was nominated for a visual

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:47,800
effects Oscar this year it's just

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,639
amazing and the Academy Software

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Foundation if you haven't heard about it

00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,080
or are interested at all in the visual

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,889
effects industry or the film industry

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,289
it's one to check out I will say without

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,020
necessarily I mean maybe I will pick on

00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:10,900
a few other projects none of our

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:13,029
projects have a real that cool like not

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,909
even well I could maybe so Linux has got

00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:19,960
the penguin so cute right people

00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:22,060
recognize it that's cool the cloud

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,150
native computing foundation has Fibby

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:28,810
how many here know the 50 and Friends

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,190
it's a very cute set of mascots so okay

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,259
they're kind of trying to keep up with

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,029
the Academy Software Foundation and then

00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,860
our networking group has this really

00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:37,860
cool mascot

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:46,170
very complex or contextual diagram they

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:49,020
get it it's their thing okay but you

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,200
know the the cool thing is no matter

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,240
whether it's networking the Linux kernel

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,640
project cloud native computing

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,000
foundation with projects like kubernetes

00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,770
and many many more or the film industry

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,010
with the Academy Software Foundation you

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:08,160
know open source is really pushing

00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,920
innovation just beyond software into

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,290
whole all sorts of different areas in

00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,870
tech and I was talking the other day

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,630
with John Corbett who's the editor of

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,550
Linux weekly news if you like Linux and

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,530
you want a good source of news Linux

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,720
weekly news it's definitely a good one

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,820
and John was saying to me like you know

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,280
there's so many different projects at

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,890
the Linux Foundation he seems to be

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,710
announcing new ones all the time but you

00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:37,440
never actually talk about the method to

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,450
that madness and you know folks want to

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,650
know like what's going on at the Linux

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,200
Foundation kind of why are you doing

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,030
what you're doing and I told them like

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,460
well one of the reasons for that is the

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,490
first rule at the Linux Foundation is

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,660
don't talk about the Linux Foundation

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,340
meaning like we'd like to talk about the

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,510
developers who work on our projects we

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,340
like to talk about the projects

00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,130
themselves I think they speak for what

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,830
we do with all the amazing outcomes

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,900
whether it's in the automotive sector or

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,210
in embedded Linux or so forth but I

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,630
thought I would spend a few minutes

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,370
today forcibly kind of almost painfully

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,780
talking about sort of where the Linux

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,550
Foundation has been and where we're

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,640
going so that it can give all of you a

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,280
little bit of context and then finish by

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,170
announcing a few more projects that a

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,080
couple more projects that are joining

00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:28,290
the Linux Foundation family this week so

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,650
as you all know by our name the Linux

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,620
Foundation started out as a home for

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:37,620
leanest Torvalds and as an organization

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,890
that I often characterize just does the

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,200
the janitorial work for what is just the

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,180
one of the greatest projects and

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,280
collaborative innovation efforts in the

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,480
world and by janitorial work I mean you

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,190
know we're there to keep the

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,550
infrastructure running that enable

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:56,070
that great investment were there to host

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,080
events like this you know the original

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,620
open-source summit was actually a Linux

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,020
event where the whole idea was hey let's

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,690
get these developers and this community

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,290
together in person because we bet in a

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,690
couple of hours we can reduce the email

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,180
traffic on L KML by an order of

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,690
magnitude just by letting people resolve

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:23,550
differences face to face we also work on

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:26,730
providing a legal framework of managing

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:29,610
trademarks of helping to make sure that

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,970
the intellectual property that the world

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,380
is investing in and depending on is

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,900
reliable and something that people can

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,270
count on so that's kind of how we got

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,890
started and that's not everything we do

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,940
but that's a decent summary of kind of

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:48,300
how we began what happened next as we

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,300
started then seeing a community's sort

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,580
of jump up right around Linux whether

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,900
it's projects like yak dough which is an

00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,970
embed ability of how many people here

00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,470
work on the Yocto project so quite a few

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,980
of you right we're at the embedded Linux

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,110
event you know Yocto started off Yocto

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,500
came out of Intel and some other

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,850
technologies that were in that area see

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,790
Dave Stewart right there it was one of

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,350
their early people working on that and

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,550
it's now grown to be really a de facto

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,470
way that people build custom Linux

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,220
systems carrier-grade Linux was another

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,020
one that came out of the

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,630
telecommunications industry so this kind

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,610
of started going so these were things

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,070
that were kind of adjacent to Linux and

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,900
we started using kind of the tools and

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,540
methodologies what we were doing in

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,910
those areas and then along came new

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,339
projects this time in the networking

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,370
sector so opendaylight

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,070
came along back when Software Defined

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,830
Networking was in somewhat early days

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,080
and the telecommunications industry was

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,560
taking all of the hardware that they

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,570
were using to run their global networks

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,660
abstracting that into software and then

00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,240
managing that virtually and at the time

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,250
an SDN controller like opendaylight was

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,510
a critical part of that transformation

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,850
of these

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,920
networks and so we worked with a huge

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,840
set of stakeholders to build an

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,110
open-source project that would create a

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,210
free open-source controller that the

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,030
industry could leverage and they do to

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:21,210
this day that's when things started

00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:23,760
getting a little bit crazy and more and

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,010
more organizations and wholesale

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,350
industries started coming to the

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,940
foundation saying we like what you're

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,310
doing in terms of helping these

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,680
communities grow enabling these

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,410
brilliant developers to create amazing

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,780
innovation outcomes building wholesale

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,350
new markets around new categories of

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,910
computing and we started doing that in a

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,940
huge way you know you just saw the

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,610
Academy Software Foundation they spent

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,950
two years with the film industry and the

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,340
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and

00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:58,800
Science convincing them and showing them

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,680
how to participate how to share their

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,560
intellectual property how to collaborate

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,200
as a community so that they could open

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,160
source all of the projects you saw on

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,250
that reel and enable essentially more

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,640
visually appealing and compelling film

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:20,790
experiences for all of us in the

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,820
automotive sector we've worked with now

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,280
I think a dozen of the top automotive

00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,830
manufacturers in the world who are now

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,670
using automotive grade Linux in

00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:35,220
production in millions of vehicles to

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:38,280
create that in vehicle software

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,740
experience that you know back when we

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,720
started it wasn't the top reason someone

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,880
bought a car people bought cars because

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,120
of the color or a gas mileage or the

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,510
body of the car today software is one of

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,180
the top reasons why people pick one

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:56,580
vehicle over the other and when the auto

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,280
industry knew that they needed to create

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,560
a ton of software to enable their

00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,840
vehicles to have a rich experience they

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,690
chose open source and they work with us

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,570
to go tackle that particular effort many

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,940
people here this week are working on

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,800
next-generation vehicles and lots of

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,019
cool technology and the best part about

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,089
it is it's all open source and

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,790
particular project the cloud native

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:24,259
computing foundation is one of the

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:27,119
hottest projects going right now and

00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:28,379
what I would remind all of you of is

00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:31,139
that the cloud native computing

00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:34,350
foundation isn't even that old how old

00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,119
is CN CF now for four years I'm getting

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,059
four years right there

00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:41,489
it was started based on an initial

00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:44,489
contribution from Google with kubernetes

00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:47,939
project has obviously grown to many more

00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:50,939
projects but the thing there is the work

00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:53,579
in open source was just part of the

00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:56,819
effort I see there's a lot of folks here

00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:58,589
from CN CF in the audience and I

00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:00,269
remember having conversations with many

00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,249
of you back then saying you know the

00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:04,619
real goal this is not only to build

00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:07,290
technology and to enable kubernetes to

00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:11,730
succeed but to move the entire industry

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,860
to a new way of deploying and developing

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,489
deploying and managing software this

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,879
sort of container microservices approach

00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:22,679
using DevOps rapid methodology back then

00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,220
was a new thing and and has become

00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:29,639
wildly successful I think there are over

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:32,129
450 members of cloud native computing

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,259
foundation today thousands and thousands

00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:36,809
of developers we're gonna be back here

00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:39,569
in November in San Diego and respect

00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:42,089
expecting I think over 10,000 people

00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:44,879
here for the cloud native computing

00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:46,529
foundation event in November so if you

00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,129
need a hotel room you better sign up

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:52,529
right now to get to that event we even

00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:55,170
kind of started going beyond open source

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,420
projects into things like let's encrypt

00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,639
which is both an open source project and

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,809
an actual service how many people here

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,889
know let's encrypt oh that's awesome

00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:06,629
when we first started talking about

00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,699
let's encrypt that was not that many

00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:10,529
people but essentially let's encrypt as

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,319
the world's largest certificate

00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:17,699
authority the idea here was if we could

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:20,730
make HTTPS if we could provide free TLS

00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:23,879
certificates to everyone all of our

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,730
security and privacy on the Internet

00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:29,580
would be better that if you build

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:33,180
everyone up collectively

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,550
have secure ways of communicating that

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,020
would be better for society and that has

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,790
knocked it out of the park is there

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,670
anyone here who works on the lexan

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,010
encrypt project in the audience there's

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:48,000
a couple people back there this just

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:50,790
amazing work it has done so so well tarz

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,490
is another example of an RPC framework

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,290
out of China where we have projects

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,170
coming in from other regions of the

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,450
world using really innovative technology

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:03,780
at high scale and we're not just

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:07,020
stopping if these initiatives we're now

00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,860
pushing even further and this year what

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:14,580
you've seen is a move from not just

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:16,950
open-source but also into open standards

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:20,340
and open specifications

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,280
well we've realized over time is that in

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,930
order to enable some of the open source

00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,870
implementations that are important to

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,540
our projects and to all the people in

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,210
our ecosystem we also need to have

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,870
specifications and standardization to

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:39,660
enable that interoperability or

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:42,450
consistency in many cases graph QL is a

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,970
great recent example of a project that

00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,550
has come to the Linux Foundation and is

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,460
really if you if you haven't checked out

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,710
graph QL this is an incredibly important

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:56,010
project go check it out on the graph QL

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:58,050
website we also have open specifications

00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,910
with implementation OCI the open

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,580
container initiative is not only a

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,440
container specification but it also

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,810
provides a legal framework so that

00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,520
people know that when they implement

00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,140
that specification that they have

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,560
intellectual property that they are

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,120
confident and can trust and then we

00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,520
recently announced the joint development

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,130
foundation the joint development

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,000
foundation is an organization under the

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:26,699
Linux Foundation focused on very quick

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,340
and straightforward open standards

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,100
initiatives this is essentially taking

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,930
the rapid innovation you see in open

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,390
source and bringing it to the world of

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:40,200
standards now I know this is a very open

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:42,809
source of friendly room and what I hear

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,669
often from open source people is

00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:46,769
that oh you know the problem with

00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:48,990
standards that we hate standards they

00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:50,700
take too long and you know we don't need

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,100
standards we're just gonna implement it

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,080
in the code and then of course the

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,789
standards people I won't repeat what

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,899
they say cuz this is really much more of

00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:03,539
open source crowd but what what is very

00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:06,090
clear is that you do actually need both

00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,789
and what the Linux Foundation is hoping

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,879
to bring to the table through JDF is a

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:15,649
more rapid way to do standards

00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:18,899
development that enhances and is

00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:20,999
interlocked with open source development

00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:24,179
so that we can have the best of both

00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:25,129
worlds but we're not just stopping there

00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:28,529
ah

00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:31,110
recently we've also delved into open

00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:34,529
hardware how many people here know risk

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:37,619
5 so of course we're the embedded Linux

00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:39,119
of it most of the events I go to don't

00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:41,129
know that maybe as well but it's an

00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,139
instruction set an open instruction set

00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:45,690
this is an amazingly fast-growing

00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:47,519
project under the Linux Foundation

00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,289
we also announced this year the chips

00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,629
Alliance it's an open hardware design

00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:52,980
project if you haven't checked out the

00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:56,490
chips Alliance I think this is something

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,610
worth checking out as well and we have a

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,259
few more open hardware projects that

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,049
we're going to talk about in a little

00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:06,269
bit but we're not even stopping there so

00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:08,580
what you're seeing here is you've got

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:11,340
open source projects at every layer of

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,379
the stack from the open J's Foundation

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,539
which has things like no JFS and a lot

00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:18,539
of JavaScript projects all the way down

00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:22,080
to infrastructure Linux kernel down to

00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:24,749
firmware hardware you know just at every

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,269
gamma to the stack that combined with

00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:30,690
open standards creates better faster

00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:32,159
open innovation and the next generation

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:37,289
of projects that we're starting to see

00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:39,330
emerge evolve around now open data so

00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:42,210
open data is now something that we're

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:45,419
really seeing is another new generation

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:48,240
of open source like projects that are

00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:51,720
important to all of us in particular as

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,049
we see the need for data in use cases

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,299
around machine learning and other things

00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:59,460
that make the world better for us we

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:03,929
need better ways just like open source

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:06,480
licensing for code to license and share

00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:09,299
data so one of the things the Linux

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,269
Foundation did was we created an open

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:14,580
data license agreement it's as to

00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:17,580
agreements that enable people to share

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,740
and organizations to share data one is

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,039
an Apache like sort of permissive

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,720
license the one is more of a GPL like

00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,100
restrictive share and back license you

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,200
can choose based on whatever

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,350
requirements you have but what this does

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,470
is provides a consistent way for people

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,730
to license datasets to enable better

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,789
interoperability or better sharing more

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:41,070
importantly amongst those data sets

00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:44,220
we've also created something called data

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:47,759
practices or which is a set of best

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,399
practices around how to actually share

00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,250
data and we've even partnered with

00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:55,799
wholesale industries in this case with

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,820
our LF Energy Initiative to be able to

00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:02,250
share data inside of specific industry

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,769
groups in this case the utilities so

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:08,009
that we can enable that data to be used

00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:11,179
to lower your power bill to fight

00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:13,950
climate change and to produce a smarter

00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:17,570
distribution of energy that all of us

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:20,909
can use and so that's sort of been the

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:24,359
evolution of the Linux Foundation in

00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:26,730
terms of how we've participated in open

00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:29,639
innovation and how what started with and

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,619
continues to be the most important open

00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:34,230
source project in the world with Linux

00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:36,059
has expanded beyond Linux to other

00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,779
layers of the stack in terms of open

00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:42,869
source to standards to open data to open

00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:46,200
hardware and we will see even more and

00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:49,859
with that I have a couple of new

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:53,070
projects at the Linux Foundation that we

00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:55,529
are announcing this week the first

00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:59,789
project I want to talk about comes back

00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:02,909
to the concept of privacy and security

00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:06,330
and that project is the confidential

00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:07,190
computing consortium the confidential

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,540
computing

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:14,390
is has been created to accelerate the

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:18,110
adoption of essentially confidential

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:22,250
computing which is a form of encrypting

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:26,090
not data at rest not data in transit but

00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:29,030
actually data in use and we have an

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:33,380
amazing set of organizations that are

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:36,410
backing this from Intel to IBM to Red

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:39,580
Hat to Microsoft to Alibaba and many

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:42,650
many more and today I want to bring out

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,190
two people who are participating in this

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,290
effort

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,870
from two organizations that are actually

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,990
contributing projects this week to the

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:53,150
confidential computing foundation let's

00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,340
first bring out Laurie why will the VP

00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,870
of architecture graphics software and

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,720
general manager platform security at

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,200
into hello welcome please give her a

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,530
hand

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,080
and john Gossman distinguished engineer

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:08,780
architect from Microsoft to learn more

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,820
about this welcome John again all right

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:16,310
why don't we come over here and have a

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:20,120
seat so how many people here are aware

00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:26,840
of the concept of confidential computing

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:29,240
or mostly the front of get some

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,580
reporters here that's a deep

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,560
technologist about Microsoft employees

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:37,070
and Intel employees so there you go

00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,080
but you know confidential computing is

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:42,470
an important concept and I'd like to

00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,980
start off if you one of you - maybe I'll

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,560
start with John could explain give us

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,150
the Primmer what is confidential

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,430
computing so I think the easiest way to

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,130
explain this term and I think it's

00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:57,050
interesting that so few people are

00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,390
familiar with even this crowd is

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,930
indication of how new it is is to think

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:05,900
about our own data as users of the web

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,090
or commerce or social network what do we

00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,160
care about that data obviously we care

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,480
about it being secure we don't want you

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,370
know hackers to get on and use it

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,370
against us and we also care about

00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,320
privacy so and this is something where I

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:20,000
think we're all much more aware than we

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,399
the past is this concept of privacy so

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,169
the that first word confidential is

00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:27,620
covering the fact that we care both

00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:29,240
about security and privacy and then if

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,309
you think about then with that data you

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,100
expect that the connection to the server

00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:36,110
is going to be securely the network is

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,350
thank you just don't you take that for

00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:42,049
granted mostly now that and that that

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,269
data also you hope that whoever gets

00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:47,000
your data is going to encrypt it at rest

00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:50,330
on the disk so that it's again both

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,789
secure and private but I think we also

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,289
know that at some point some sort of

00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:56,360
algorithm is going to have to do

00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:59,539
something with that data and if it's

00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,820
just completely opaque encrypted blob

00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,980
you're kind of in problems so the

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,259
contest of confidence computing is you

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,090
alluded to an introduction is that we

00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:11,090
can actually keep the data encrypted

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:14,090
while programs are working on it and

00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:17,600
this turns out to have you know just an

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:20,360
enormous wealth of scenarios good

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,730
support yeah I mean it's Laurie your

00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,220
group has done probably the some of the

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,970
most research in the world on this

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:32,059
concept of confidential computing and

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,850
give us a little bit more depth on this

00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:36,019
concept of secure Enclave and how it

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:40,159
works because I think that helps people

00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:42,409
understand what it actually is sure so

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,720
for a few years now we have had a

00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:47,179
capability built into Intel processors

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,879
or some Intel processors called software

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:52,850
guard extensions and that provides a

00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:55,250
hardware based capability for protecting

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,110
an area of memory you could think of as

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,509
a trusted execution environment so as

00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:02,149
John mentioned in that trusted execution

00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:05,000
environment the hardware protections are

00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:07,370
there for both the data as well as the

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,350
code and if you think about it as we're

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,110
moving more and more into artificial

00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,909
intelligence people care about the

00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,889
privacy of the data but they're also

00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:18,440
increasingly concerned about protecting

00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,940
their algorithms because a lot of times

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,909
that's where the intellectual property

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,139
is so this whole concept of confidential

00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:25,970
computing and trusted execution

00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:29,659
environments can be used for both of

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:31,710
those things yeah yeah so John Microsoft

00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:34,200
is contributing an SDK

00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:37,860
this week to the confidential computing

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,630
consortium and I assume that's to let

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,580
more developers be able to access this

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,860
technology but what was the

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,530
decision-making and what's behind this

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,510
effort to open-source that sure so I

00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,820
don't think I probably have to sell the

00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:54,540
merits of open source to too many people

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:58,680
in this at the right over this room but

00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:01,530
the open Enclave SDK is designed to make

00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,060
it easier this is you know Laurie

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,550
alerted started out as hardware

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,840
instructions very on the silicon and it

00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,630
kind of builds up from there well that's

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:14,100
a pretty low level API that most

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:18,570
developers we have to Kim are like and

00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,880
so with the open Enclave SDK and along

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,160
some of the other contributions other

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,680
people are bringing to them to the

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,970
consortium it's to make it easier it's

00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,710
just like anything this is middleware

00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:32,190
this is the next level provides

00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,990
application portability makes it easier

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:37,320
to write applications that run across

00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:40,290
both devices cloud and and raise up that

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,910
level of abstraction and also bake in

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,110
some you know some patterns because one

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,230
of the things again with security

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,960
software is you want to get the tricky

00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:50,910
bits right and you want to have as many

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,050
eyes and and people looking at that and

00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:55,080
figuring it making sure that that's

00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:56,880
correct as possible yeah tell me about

00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,500
why that's why the time is right now

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,710
sort of the state you know I see a lot

00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,810
of big names up there but what is kind

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,600
of the state of the art of you know

00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,790
academic research and industry adoption

00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,030
of this like what why this particular

00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,830
project now so we felt in particular

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,380
that this was a the perfect time to do

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,790
this because the technology the concepts

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,200
have been out there long enough that

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,500
we're seeing a lot of traction in the

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,080
research community for Intel SGX

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,570
specifically we have more than 200

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,220
academic papers that have been published

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,890
but we're also seeing a lot of our

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,100
ecosystem partners beginning to invest

00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:37,410
in this space and so it's a really great

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,060
time to bring those efforts together so

00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,360
that we don't end up with fragmentation

00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,860
and in fact we have the best minds

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,210
collaborating on moving this forward and

00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,600
making it easy for

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:50,630
developers to access it you know we live

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,210
in a world where a lot of times

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:56,490
convenience and privacy are in tension

00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:59,039
with each other and this is a capability

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,559
that has the promise of letting us have

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,539
it all but we do need to cooperate and

00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,520
collaborate to make that happen yeah I

00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,260
mean I think so one question I'd like to

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,880
ask both of you is I think some people

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,470
are here are familiar with sort of

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,149
secure enclaves to be used for like

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,850
authentication or something like that

00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:17,340
but you've both been thinking about a

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,679
lot of different use cases beyond things

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,720
like that tell tell the folks about some

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,390
of the examples of how this particular

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,210
technology might be utilized so some of

00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,880
the early work that we're seeing happen

00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:33,299
right now that is probably the most

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:35,850
interesting is collaboration between

00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:38,279
institutions on very sensitive

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,490
information like healthcare data so

00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,710
think about the innovation and the new

00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,350
discoveries can have that can happen if

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:49,380
the data can be shared but yes this is

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,720
the very very most sensitive data so

00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,570
this notion of multi-party compute and

00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,240
being able to use confidential computing

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,940
and data protections to enable that

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,309
sharing is going to unleash a lot of

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,630
innovation yeah and you know as I was

00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,250
talking earlier you can see all these

00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,070
things all linked together in terms of

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:10,350
there's how you license the data they're

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,690
safe ways to then share that data

00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,669
without disclosing it to others all this

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,919
stuff starts to come together which it

00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:18,029
would be grateful for all of us John how

00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,220
about you what are you seeing out there

00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:22,350
know what says the fascinating thing is

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,490
you think of it first of all like like

00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,440
yourself as never getting to give it

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,850
security and privacy but then you start

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,940
thinking about well if you've got this

00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:33,450
place where you can compute on data now

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,919
you can have what transactions that are

00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,600
joint transactions between parties that

00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,010
don't entirely necessarily trust each

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,200
other they certainly don't want to link

00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,779
that data from one place to another and

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,220
work together you know obviously a lot

00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,140
of getting that change of trust in the

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,330
code and that's just the code or to make

00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,220
sure that that is all working but this

00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,020
is an incredible enabling technology and

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,789
I just think we haven't even really

00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,840
scratched the surface on what the

00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,480
scenarios

00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,670
yeah yeah well I would encourage all of

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,340
you if you work for an organization that

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,860
cares about this - go and check out the

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,260
confidential computing consortium if you

00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,690
want to go get the SDK and check it out

00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:12,420
if you want to read some of the 200

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,150
papers that Lawrence organization has

00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,860
painstakingly published go check those

00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,110
out as well but we're really excited

00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,190
about this particular effort we do think

00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,080
it's something that can improve the

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,180
privacy and security of all of us so

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:32,550
thank you both for being here and we

00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:34,860
look forward to great things but we are

00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:39,300
not stopping there we've got another

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:41,820
open hardware initiative so this week we

00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:45,240
also announced that the open power

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,910
foundation is becoming a part of the

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,910
Linux Foundation this is a community

00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:53,820
that is enabling innovation on the power

00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:57,420
architecture and here to discuss it with

00:31:53,820 --> 00:32:04,230
us is Ken King the GM of power from IBM

00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:06,240
Ken come on up thank you I see I see

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,390
Laurie tried to trip you as you were

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,260
walking out on stage there now now that

00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:14,940
we're now that we're good friends we got

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,290
plenty of room for innovation for

00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,910
everyone tell us about what's going on a

00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,820
new open power yeah we're real excited

00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:22,040
we let the news out yesterday even

00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,240
though we're officially putting the

00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,400
press release on the wire today we've

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,440
already got a lot of great press and

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,000
analysts stories written about it the

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,350
community is excited we've got

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,910
endorsements from a number of different

00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,970
players but basically what we're doing

00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,470
is we're taking the we've seen what's

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:41,040
been happening in the industry right

00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:43,140
with all the the move towards big day to

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,510
data explosion AIX cetera and the need

00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,430
for greater levels of performance in the

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,990
system not just the processor but in the

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,670
system yep you look at some of the

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,980
challenges going on at the processor

00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:54,960
with Moore's Law and other things we've

00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,580
seen through the open power foundation

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,440
work over the last five years the need

00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,630
to drive much greater levels of

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,670
integration with accelerators with

00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,780
stored with the memory etc and we've

00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:06,360
been doing that and we've been driving

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,110
that innovation but we realized as we

00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,630
see the things going on the Open Compute

00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:12,970
project things going on with you know

00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:15,580
other new open-source Isis that are

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,929
coming out and even others like hyper

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,309
scalars and other players that are

00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:19,990
actually hiring chip designers and

00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:21,520
creating their own accelerators their

00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,950
own capabilities to address that

00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,500
performance if there is a need in the

00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,720
industry to take the openness of power

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,070
to the next level and that's what we've

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,559
announced yep we're taking the

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,750
instruction set we are now licensing it

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,549
to the open power foundation such that

00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,670
anybody can implement on top of it

00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:42,220
royalty free with patent rights great so

00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:44,710
now anybody can implement any kind of

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,809
open capability hardware capability on

00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,179
top of it without any concerns about

00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:50,500
what that means and we've got a lot of

00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:53,140
great feedback on that

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,280
we're also taken that to a level of open

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,429
governance which is where our

00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,650
relationship is growing which is now the

00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:04,150
instruction set architecture can be

00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:06,730
enhanced extended added to based on an

00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,740
open model so the there will be an open

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,600
governance workshop in the open power

00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,149
workgroup that workshop yeah we're a

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,790
group in the open power foundation yeah

00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:18,429
that will be the voting body for

00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:20,530
determining whether anybody's extension

00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:22,929
can be approved it just needs a majority

00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,909
you hope for that IBM gets one vote yep

00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,129
so it is now an open governance model

00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,629
for adding and extending to the icer

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:30,609
which is exciting as well and it just

00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:33,340
reinforces the point of this is really

00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:37,060
an open model yeah secondly we are

00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:40,330
contributing to the community our RTL

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:42,460
and and open source for our open copy

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,590
and open memory interface which are

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,149
coherent accelerator and memory

00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,040
interface standards they were now

00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:49,510
putting in the community yep and we're

00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,000
looking to work with other communities

00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,760
like cxl and others to drive convergence

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,100
to create truly and a common open

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,140
standard for those acceleration and i/o

00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,510
and memory interface capabilities so

00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,480
we're excited about that as well and

00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,490
then last but not least is we are taking

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,230
the open power foundation and we're

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:10,390
putting it but staying with its own

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,190
membership and and board and everything

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,859
and it's normal policies but it'll be a

00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:17,020
part of the Linux Foundation you know

00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,000
and we see that as a message to the

00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,160
marketplace Linux Foundation is one of

00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,850
the leading if not the leading

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,190
open-source commune

00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,990
and body in the industry and having the

00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,610
opah power foundation as part of that is

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,820
a statement to the industry that this is

00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:32,830
truly an open model yeah we had you know

00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:35,230
we have that great response just in the

00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,330
24 hours or so I'm getting LinkedIn and

00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,440
requests like crazy for people to want

00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,450
to collaborate I don't know in the

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,060
naming names and companies and so forth

00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,610
but you know we really see this as a is

00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,890
a great way to really open up the

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,540
hardware side of the industry

00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,890
yeah what's interesting is you know at

00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,370
events like this we get a lot of

00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:56,680
requests for matchmaking essentially

00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,960
with chip designers and hardware folks

00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,940
and software people because you know

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,740
we're seeing more and more from

00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,680
different organizations or different

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:07,510
users of tech you know the need for more

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,150
hardware acceleration and more custom

00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:12,580
hardware acceleration for again you know

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:15,460
machine learning and kind of compute

00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:17,770
intensive applications that are emerging

00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,440
in the market now so we are psyched to

00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,210
have you onboard and very happy to be

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,280
working with the open power foundation

00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,870
and hope for many great things to come

00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,800
from it we like photo chip all right

00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,820
they partnership all right thank you all

00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,470
[Applause]

00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:38,740
right we just have a couple more

00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:40,570
announcements to share first the cloud

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,910
native computing foundation again back

00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:45,490
here in November book your hotel rooms

00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:49,270
now that's going to be sold out but they

00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:52,180
have added 49 new end-user members

00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:54,600
including GoDaddy LinkedIn Vodafone so

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,250
now there are over a hundred end-user

00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,080
organizations that are members of this

00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,610
particular effort this is an important

00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,100
thing to look at because it really shows

00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:06,820
that the technology becoming mainstream

00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:10,360
and widely adopted our open mainframe

00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:13,750
project is announcing new members and a

00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:16,420
zowie conformance program so if you are

00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:19,000
a part of that particular effort go

00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:23,200
check out the open mainframe project as

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:27,790
well I have one final thing that I want

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:31,620
to do today and that is to recognize

00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:35,200
someone in our community that has made a

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:37,990
significant contribution to

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,450
this sort of story about open source and

00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:42,760
standards and sharing that have been

00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:46,480
talking about how many people here know

00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,130
the SPD X project the software package

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,500
data exchange process so this is

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,140
essentially a standardized way to share

00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:56,280
a software Bill of Materials across a

00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:59,079
supply chain as open source becomes

00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,780
fundamental to all technology products

00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:04,660
and services and as the dependencies and

00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,700
complexities of that grows with hundreds

00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,460
and thousands of packages in any product

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:13,089
or service the need for the industry to

00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,980
track what is actually in every

00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:16,960
technology product and service down to

00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:20,079
the package version number license and

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:24,400
so forth was recognized years ago as a

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,380
problem that would come to form and in

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,079
order to meet that challenge the Linux

00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:32,049
Foundation and lots of passionate folks

00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:34,240
from the legal industry who wanted to

00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:36,339
track license compliance and

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,160
intellectual property across that supply

00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:42,280
chain got together to figure out a good

00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,970
way to do it and as you can imagine when

00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:48,010
lawyers and engineers get into a room

00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:53,130
together great things happen every

00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:56,710
single time what's so funny all right

00:38:53,130 --> 00:39:00,520
but um one of the people who really led

00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:02,319
this was an attorney who's now an

00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,839
attorney at canonical but her name is

00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:08,200
Jolene Lovejoy

00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:12,569
Jolene has spent countless hours since

00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:15,099
2009 working on the s dpdx project

00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:18,180
working to make sure that the

00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:20,710
requirements of a very complex

00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,040
specification of a very complex software

00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,900
supply chain could happen and really you

00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,190
know one of the gifts that Julianne

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:32,859
really has is building a bridge between

00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:35,380
legal minds and software Minds which is

00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:37,780
a true true gift so as part of that we

00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,900
want to recognize Jelena Love joy by

00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:43,270
