Description: 
	Adopting Linux on BMW - The Long Road to Integrate Linux as Mainline Platform - Helio Chissini de Castro, BMW

Automotive industry is in the first stages of adopt fully open source systems on their stack.Not only the software itself, but constraints on safety, security, compliance, new cultural processes complete different from traditional ones. Is an industry that has a past and simply has no possibility to start from scratch.At BMW, the adaptation for the new reality was planned in long step plans to achieve the most seamless transition to the new processes.From the ground build to the main software and OS to the buildsystem and test mechanism, every single detail need to be care in a different way, and integration was the core aspect of all.Unique aspects as multiple computers, different architectures, strict requirements, certification, a real Linux Brave New WorldAs OS Team, we want to share how the system was integrated on the middle of the process and the steps to be done to achieve the full platform that will drive our customers for a bright car future.

mmm hello everyone following the German

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:11,070
tradition let's start on punch wall so

00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,610
good evening everyone my name is Ellie

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,350
oh and I'm here to actually talk about

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,779
the whole difficulty things that

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,230
automotive industry are facing right now

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,970
to get Linux in there I'm trying to go a

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,010
little bit faster in the faster slides

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,869
because I want to give some space for

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,910
more questions in the end because I

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,759
think bless the slides will open more

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,140
questions for them so let me present to

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,879
myself so my name is Lu Castro I'm

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,940
Brazilian but live in Germany is almost

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,090
5 years right now I'm working for BMW

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,700
car IT is one part of the BMW Group it's

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,969
not very no to everyone but BMW group is

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,969
a huge holding that's mostly know about

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,149
to heaven mini and whole course as well

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,480
together with BMW and wooden is in the

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:03,600
middle between Munich our headquarters

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,820
and inter schleissheim where the

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,500
self-driving Development Center oome is

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,390
basically the center of the software

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,240
development where we do integration and

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,420
basically development on everything this

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,430
is the building there and see I was open

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,820
source developer I've been KD developer

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,790
since ever and then I joined in this

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,770
very snowy time for a Brazilian arrive

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:31,130
in a country is knowing is very

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:34,920
completely different so let's talk about

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,020
the industries so every single industry

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,420
is different one thing that people

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,329
really don't realize I'm talking about

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,159
Linux and adopting Linux is like we're

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,170
not talking about and put in Linux

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,770
inside your computer anymore and just

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:53,729
use it every single industry has their

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,560
peculiarities and then it's very detail

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:00,090
8 things that people need to understand

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,759
so if you're looking around about mobile

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,240
industry it's a real embedded system in

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,740
the past adopted Linux through Android

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,970
really late I was part of the Nokia

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,770
project n9 and before the arrive at our

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,030
arrival BMW

00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:20,720
so it's really the legacy UNIX and Linux

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,510
basic platform oriented so to see you

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,430
looking around there's a telecon telecon

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,680
is a UNIX legacy application it comes

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,570
from the long long long time ago it's

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,120
completely different about the mobile

00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,860
there so it's easy translatable for

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,180
Linux word that's why it's the first

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,220
industry that adopted massively then we

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,070
have our special this dedicated

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,850
applications heavily dependencies on

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,460
safety aspects it means that we barely

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:52,370
see Linux running there until you

00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,180
understand in the in the next slides

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,120
there of why and for example financial

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,130
financials FTS applications then it's

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,860
easy translatable to UNIX and Linux

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:08,450
there on the time as the legacy there so

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:12,500
it's easy there but we have automotive

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:15,500
so assembly lines are unique and LTSs

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,810
like long time service so we think that

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,660
usually cars need to be maintained at

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:26,890
like 10 years in the modern world to the

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:30,430
a 10 years computers is like ages so why

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:33,770
assembly line is so important this

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:37,670
several models of cars still building it

00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:39,920
was design it before years and then we

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,380
have one two years three years five

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,040
years of designs that actually it's been

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,800
producing there so it's several tools to

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,350
actually prepare the cars they are in a

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,080
line this is actually you wrote there

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,630
pun intended because it's a literally a

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,270
line so doesn't matter which car you are

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,280
doing is one after another the assembly

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,710
line does go until the end there and

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,740
something failures into the one car it

00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:10,610
stops the whole assembly line its Moneda

00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:14,090
and then the companies cannot afford to

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:16,820
actually use multiple tools you need to

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,459
be the same all BMW have one single tool

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,260
and for each operation there and you

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,210
need to follow exactly the strictly

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,330
who's usually made at home and then and

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,400
unlikely

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,470
the companies we cannot simply create a

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,370
new assembly line for a new model of car

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:37,460
would be comparable in terms of price so

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,440
in Linux there are our main bumps that

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,720
we have actually there was adopted the

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,970
resulting platform to be use it in

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,000
assembly line without interfere and the

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,220
current process current process I mean

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,229
the cars that you are buying today and

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,210
what is already in an assembly line the

00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:56,210
moment that you put the new software and

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,490
start to flash in the new cars we are

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,750
drilling with exactly what's happening

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:05,330
already so we cannot stop the line it's

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,229
not a sample thing that if not to work

00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,150
in and we just fix it there no and most

00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,719
of the tools are legacy tools it's

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:17,810
coming like several detail formats and

00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:20,300
other things that come in from ages so

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,419
the for the one explained and later is

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,870
that for example the interface for BMWs

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:29,840
the same code runs in several ages of

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,240
cars this is just apply it and use it on

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,430
several times so we basically we need to

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,110
adopt and still use in there in the

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,599
modern environment without affecting

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,120
what is there in legacy environment and

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:43,250
the resultant deployment should be

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,289
transparent so when you go on to the

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,659
factory the workers on the factory

00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,610
doesn't understand oh you are using

00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:51,650
Linux we are doing different no it's

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,719
like the process ugly the same important

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,490
the process need to be the same they

00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:58,690
don't care about the resulting in the

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:02,150
end is like the car running that's it

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:06,050
so BMW already has Linux if you actually

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:08,990
buy a BMW on the last last year for the

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,690
modern ones serious it's coming with a

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,090
head unit it's the head unit is fully

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,039
Linux why is this first one is the

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,919
foundation for the big plan why is so

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,629
like the first one because we have an

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,729
important factor call it we don't have

00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,310
safety of it inside the head units

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,560
despite this something that people say

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,110
that oh we can hug the cars plug in

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,580
something on head units and connect the

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,399
car and everything no it isn't actually

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,070
not true because this is completely the

00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,950
couple of them the safety systems of the

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,110
car we have specific comments for

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,720
basically known safety-related today

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,450
there there's no changing in the future

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,180
because the car will become unique but

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,040
in this case so the head unit was a very

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,750
good example you can see here in the

00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,240
real pictures the mini and the BMW

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,300
they're running ended and the

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,670
development station that we have at our

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,060
offices there so it is behind the

00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:07,280
project of the head units it's we did

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,310
the device from scratch no safety

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,740
relevant there it's full Linux based on

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:16,490
Yocto and we get a nod for the Geneva

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:20,390
project and there this is part of this

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,400
one so we use it Yocto for this part is

00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,160
a fully base it was completely

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,980
integrated on New York tow and the UX

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,080
are completely ported to Linux so it's

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,870
exactly the same UX you use in every

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,880
evolution so if you talking about BMW

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,140
actually you can hear about oh you are

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,630
using ID 5 ID 786 so it's exactly how it

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,170
the generations of the interface for the

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,610
BMW are is the continuous integration as

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,520
made in-house or is the first time that

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,170
we made every single process there so

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,410
the software entered in the form of

00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,120
source code and end up in an integration

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,240
there it was my first project when they

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:02,120
enter in BMW and that's exactly we are

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,920
did an integration part went is the

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,690
resulting things go directly to the

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:12,170
factory them so so what's still actually

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:16,160
now my current job is Akram lead of the

00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,920
OS team there and we are supposed to put

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,840
Linux entirely on the cars right now not

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,180
anymore

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,610
the parts of the on the head unit or

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,260
details there everything that will be

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,930
used in the future will be based in

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,630
Linux and it was really hard this is the

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,960
four related parts that I want to say

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:39,380
about first one and the most important

00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,140
one is right in a moment safety so Linux

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,120
is not functional safety qualified so in

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,910
automotive work different from the other

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,180
industries we have free tacos :

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,220
standards collared azo ba Zod so

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,519
automotive softer

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,800
interpolation level that's actually

00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,259
safety levels that actually determine

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,769
how much you can able to failure or not

00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:07,160
during a several thousand of operations

00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,800
there it's it's a little bit lower than

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,949
actually you're having in the airplane

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,410
and aerospace industry but still it's

00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:18,170
very hard so we are putting some in some

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,629
place that we can actually could

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,589
endanger and the environment around and

00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:28,370
Linux were not safety qualified yet it's

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:32,779
mostly not technical work is actually a

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:37,129
lot of specification work a lot of

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:39,350
investigation work and so thus we are

00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:42,129
having two steps right now the current

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:46,579
project is now in the analysis for this

00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:49,939
exactly we need to specify very strict

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:51,949
things like we need to fix one kernel we

00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:54,230
need to fix the compiler we need to fix

00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:56,720
the options of the compiler we need to

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,660
see how the things are built in every

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,199
single detail and you go to what is

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,809
really safety qualified or not and we

00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:07,819
cannot simply change like that in the

00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:11,000
future for the updates it's not

00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:13,220
something it's a little like an embedded

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,029
project but a little bit further because

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,610
it's more you need to be more safe it's

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:21,589
really hard and BMW join it the Linux

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,459
Foundation does a project that's called

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:26,089
le ELISA

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:27,319
that's founder that's we we are the one

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:30,379
of the first to join this project

00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:33,379
getting take to make Linux safety

00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:38,449
qualified in the future we hope that

00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:40,579
Linux will be on at some point use it

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:42,379
everywhere and you want to have the

00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:45,230
Linux as the car and everything

00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:48,889
so the Lisa project is really the Perl

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,829
one of the main goals from this the

00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,779
second thing security that's let's say

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:55,670
security is something that everyone

00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,319
actually understand in the Linux world

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,350
that's No Deal

00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:02,990
so why you're talking about security yes

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,350
because no we still need to deal with

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,870
algorithms or restrictions we need to

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:12,040
knew it everything that's happening is

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,810
around is the protocols is more than not

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,190
simple protocol system that you actually

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:21,100
know is not simple dance protocol or

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,810
simple md5 or whatever you use it it's

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,400
always it comes for different kind of

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,950
protocols that you need to be introduced

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,960
it and you need to actually some point

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,870
qualified the connection and in the

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,270
communication about this and that's

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,900
interdependency with safety aspects

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,970
because we cannot simply say that we're

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,100
not put in a cryptography there and

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,020
everything and you can guarantee that

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,680
this will be completely safe and to the

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,570
end so this is the part that you

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,570
understand security but in the end we

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,980
need to do a lot of things in there the

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,050
third part is about compliance

00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:02,350
compliance is the logical thing because

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,580
it's in general companies that start

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,650
working source without thinking about

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:10,210
compliance no no it's this is my new

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:12,690
food and there's a way to solve this so

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:16,960
what happens when you release a product

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:21,070
this exactly what happens so we release

00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,380
in the i3 and then some guy looking over

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:26,380
they are using Linux inside a tree they

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:29,680
had units as i3 so the guy wrote to the

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,270
tiller that's not exactly the right way

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,040
but anyway it's like a consumer

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,630
understand a carb was bought to the

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,940
dealer so talk to the dealer

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,120
I want the source code he's on the right

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,970
side yes I want the source code every

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,420
single source code there he's exactly

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,150
wrote about that because I know that BMW

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,890
not answer I know that actually they

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,540
were not able to do that he wrote

00:12:50,890 --> 00:13:01,060
actually is equate a lot of in internet

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:06,850
but he didn't know about this oh we

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:08,320
answer that basically it just wrote for

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,230
the dealer that didn't actually

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,040
understand that if you get at the end of

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,230
the whole process on the screen with all

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,670
the license that we are mandatory to be

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,700
and they are in the screens

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,200
the car he says it if you need something

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,320
for the source code or things please

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,570
send to this email so the guy send email

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,000
say oh we're not to answer there and we

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,700
answer and then we send a DVD with food

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,950
source code of a tree and the guy put

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:39,670
that online on github and still there

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,650
today did you bother with that no we are

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,660
really happy and now what I talked to

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:47,080
you about and what we actually do insist

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,540
to start the project every single beaut

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm not talking about one time and what

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,200
to release another time every single

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,500
beaut that you create an image inside

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,480
the CI it comes out to Metallica with

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,670
set of tour balls and an image of

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,490
open-source software used there with

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,230
license everything compliance so we

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,360
don't need to bother to discover this

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,760
since the beginning we started to make

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,410
this and this actually paid off he

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,630
apologized and actually made the blog

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,450
and I was there and he even find some

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,210
security flaws inside the code which was

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:22,450
perfect because it's exactly what we

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,310
expected so then we could able to solve

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,350
it we fix it there you go

00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,860
and this is the one thing that is very

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:33,190
important compliance for there it's ok

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,500
but we need to go farther so we are part

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,480
of in a group of compressors compliance

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,940
with this tooth is one examples that we

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,940
can really use it it's really available

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,850
for open source group is a huge huge

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,710
projects there we can have a full -

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,580
chain of open-source compliance for oh

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:54,610
this open-source software there and we

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:58,510
can you can do it this today from the

00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:00,580
CIA so it is this guarantee that the

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,710
piece of the lawyers at some point at

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:06,130
least and released the first time which

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,140
is really hard to do it and of course

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:13,180
the acquisition this is actually it's

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:15,160
very curious thing this you know

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,890
automotive industry never use in Linux

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,140
and not open-source us like effective

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,090
there they are actually using internally

00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,190
to development but not to produce them

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,700
so most of the people using some other

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,620
proprietary systems there are specific

00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,740
safety qualified operational systems

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,120
it's completely fair does not exist

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:38,010
time it means and in software industry

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,160
for automotive has a huge amount of

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,650
companies around it it's not one two

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,390
three it's several ones meanings that

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,030
these people are working with legacy

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,100
existence and the comp people working in

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,140
the inside the company are working with

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,930
the legacy assistants they never touch

00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:58,080
sometimes the Linux before and we are

00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:01,080
jumping completely Linux so they

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,180
understand about the past but a new one

00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,610
they don't have time to understand we

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,990
fear we face some large problems that

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,030
people are still developing software

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,890
like the old one and you need to

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,810
actually teach them but this has

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,890
happened during the process there so

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:20,820
it's really complex there in the end

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:23,880
that we even cannot cannot bear in the

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,920
future doing this again so what we

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,170
should do like it's a recommendation

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,240
that for people that we are doing and

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:34,370
jumping on Linux for some reason for

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,300
other environments please give time to

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,670
training these people and they

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,340
understand everything there because they

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,590
are afraid to do it exactly they're

00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,810
things that very critical and safety

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,090
critical and their job and they know

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,620
about one way a there are not trusting

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,660
and doing a different way and sometimes

00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,690
they hurt the process so we need to

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,610
teach people about that this is a really

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,970
difficult thing we are not simply cannot

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:02,760
hire another amount of developers it's

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,920
simple even if you can afford in terms

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,470
of money you know that's impossible

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,680
today to find developers everyone is

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:12,660
caring and the second thing is that we

00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,910
cannot simply change in a team or simply

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,130
ask and then and that's the fact you man

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,710
factor that actually they they have

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,260
afraid to do your with new things and to

00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:24,420
do in a different way it's it need to be

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,270
understood and this this is not simple

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,510
thing that we actually expect that's ok

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,610
you know about C or C++ so you

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,670
understand everything to do C C++ on

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:37,560
their site is not the same really you

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,290
need and you need to be clear about that

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,970
this is the ecosystem around you will

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:45,080
change and you need to teach there

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:49,270
consists in how we will change

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,070
Zhukov future however view of the future

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,380
projects so would for this current

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,440
project I think a lot of questions will

00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,240
come from this one but we have multiple

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,330
architectures running and parallel

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:06,410
inside the car this is for the future

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:10,130
cars we have strictly separation its

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:12,800
meaning in the development way we need

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,680
to make it an easy way to separate how

00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,480
the operational system how the SDK and

00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,910
how the applications are development

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,520
because otherwise if you try to

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,170
integrate everything together the speed

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,480
will go down and there will be very

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:29,660
difficult and force people to work on

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,180
more things that should do actually we

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:37,910
have everything fully integrated on our

00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:39,830
CI and no binary blobs at all we here in

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:43,340
this beginning of the project we really

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,780
ask that no binary blobs does not come

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,870
in anything it doesn't matter where it

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:51,370
comes as a matter which is it's

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:54,170
basically based on latest the Linux LTS

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,750
right now we are using for nating big

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,030
why is because that's at the time that

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,420
we decided to fix at the prior the new

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,850
one LTS will not be available if the new

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:09,050
alts will be available in time that

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:10,940
which we demand that actually safe to go

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,460
to the project will go for that

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:18,230
but we expect that this before anything

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:21,770
and it will be basic for the dynamic

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,260
driving it means that the car for soft

00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,840
drive in the future and BMWs will have

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,270
full Linux

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,890
that's exactly on what is back then

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:37,730
there I think that's for this I got a

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:39,710
little bit faster then thanks and I want

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,420
to open for the kind there are questions

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,680
that because then I can explain whether

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,680
some details

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:59,789
why we decided to go Linux well does we

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,130
made that the first head unit and the

00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:10,080
results who are really appreciated and

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:12,210
we really sorry no no this is it says it

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,850
so basically the reason is exactly that

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,220
so the first project was started first

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,900
in the open source and the car IT is

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,030
working open source then we decided to

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,659
go to head unit and the head unit was

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,460
the project was really successful so at

00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:30,480
the end there so the next one say can

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:33,059
you actually go for Linux and the high

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:43,530
management decided yes that's it

00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:47,580
it's a big boat thing yes so yeah using

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:49,559
a real-time fetch yes you're using the

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:54,600
official real-time patch is no no suka

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:57,539
does this comment this and we are even a

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,820
part of it talking exfoliation will be

00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,400
part of the project for LTL and the

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:07,710
Linux Foundation this one so it's not

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:10,280
secret about that okay let's go first

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,280
there than there

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,550
we need to have support for 10 years

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:42,890
everything it need to be safety

00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,120
qualified in it be on the road at the

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,850
point that to be safe

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,500
it's the point is that is not different

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,300
for any other operational system we just

00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,450
don't have the papers that say safety

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:56,270
qualified and but at the point it need

00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:01,240
to be supported it's no question about

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,240
that minimum 10 years expected for more

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:17,540
yep it's a very hard question I simply

00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:20,140
cannot answer with that and the I can

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,210
say the main question right now I say no

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,160
we not expect that and you need to be

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:29,150
supported and fixed and as long that it

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,950
is data but I will be lying that is at

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,500
some point some things can happen that

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,270
you needed to do that but right now

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,400
official answer for coming

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:39,590
at least from our side this is coming no

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,480
wait we are stay there and maintained as

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,030
one as long as possible that's why

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,100
actually we are taking measures to

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,410
participate or exactly the foundations

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,740
that we can guarantee that this happens

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,740
in the future

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:06,610
yep the head unit in the past yes

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,679
graphics it has binary blobs future not

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,350
anymore we are done we are putting this

00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,629
is specifically requirements so we are

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,519
going after that there's no question

00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:20,019
asked there yeah I know that's difficult

00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:21,909
principally because the the graphic what

00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:23,409
my background comes from graphics as

00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:26,139
well I understand about the whole

00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:28,779
algorithms and video playback yeah but

00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:30,879
we expect no binary blocks there's

00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:32,649
actually no reason to have binary blobs

00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:35,769
as long that will have contracts on the

00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:39,009
points this so we are going after that

00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:41,049
it sometimes it cannot cannot happens

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:44,879
because it's basically Constitution but

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:44,879
our end goal is that

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:06,300
today is only head unit and Annette this

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:13,790
project means everything is how far down

00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:13,790
was like everything yes yeah

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,019
note in this case there's no way to

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,590
solve it but we are not using any video

00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:40,179
at the moment so what if if in the

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,610
future we need to use any video yes

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,539
there's something that we cannot solve

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:48,669
it by ourselves

00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:50,850
it's true but in general things no this

00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:50,850
is

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,799
yeah and I understand the question

00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:12,110
because they come from this background

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:15,350
and open source a long time and Linux

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,850
distributions there and the reality is a

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,519
little bit different we are talking

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,529
about so we need separate and as if you

00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,360
thinking about feelings itself yes we

00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:26,749
are thinking about that but as a company

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,090
there if the the proper business

00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:31,909
decision is done is something that we

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,970
cannot simplify yes we love that we go

00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:39,129
to follow the ideology on this one but I

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,129
don't think that's the not reality

00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,810
yeah this is okay internally we actually

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,400
do that so this is it need to be

00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,200
evaluated for several people is not

00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,450
there if we have the whole process so

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,240
it's not simply blindly accepted we are

00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,070
explaining about situation and then it's

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,290
accepted or not that's the point but

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,610
this is not something that we go blindly

00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,610
they say can it cannot do that

00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:38,200
well this is well explaining the whole

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:40,360
process in there and it's everyone who

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,850
knows about adaptive AUTOSAR AUTOSAR

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,500
itself so AUTOSAR is basically

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,440
operational system that was made in four

00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:51,429
there and then we he decided that

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,080
AUTOSAR itself dependence of some

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:56,080
operational system in the case is most

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,909
common desire X and the odd access it's

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,409
already there we start the it's

00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:02,470
basically the start car and the start

00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:04,919
tab and then we need okay the they see

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:07,750
you need to have some software this

00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,370
autos are itself we not is not the base

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,929
of TC we need something more powerful

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,090
we're talking about self-driving in

00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,730
modern things so we have the choices of

00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,500
operational systems we have some trials

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,409
of other operational assistance in the

00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,559
end Linux and we already has a basic

00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:25,980
expertise because the had unit so there

00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,080
we go we go into Linux the CI is already

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,539
went to had a full expertise we have an

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,169
internal CIA entirely made that for the

00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:37,360
the head unit so we created the new CI

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:41,140
completely from the ground to your to

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,570
running Linux and to get this right in

00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,630
the process we code software we sent the

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:49,360
CI the CI build the CI put the images it

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,370
goes to the tests Suz units the test the

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,860
CC units and provide the full software

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,200
ready to actually flash so we get one

00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,440
point to the other point no no human

00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,440
intervention

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:20,190
okay so let's put in this way and the

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,039
base system is to the base system

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,350
it's Linux there so we what we go for

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:32,100
using a separated protected containers

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:33,900
for parts of their and that's a bit then

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,549
we will need to be exactly separated

00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,110
what is running or not and how it

00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:40,980
communicates the business every control

00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:43,230
that yes we are going and this way it's

00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,140
still ongoing development because I will

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:48,169
target this future it's not exactly for

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:52,830
this generation that you buy into now

00:28:48,169 --> 00:29:01,320
but yes we are looking for this part we

00:28:52,830 --> 00:29:04,980
already have a set up for this when

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:09,210
possible yes because mostly the time of

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:12,110
year still users of to open-source we

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,730
are not exactly modifying the software

00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:16,500
with the fork but the software that we

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,620
already modified in the upstream and

00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,720
parts is do t the logging diamond that

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:24,600
actually open source from Geneva so in

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,490
the in the stage of the the project for

00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,130
heavy unit actually several software's

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:31,470
had some up string code coming and the

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:34,860
Yocto has part we are able to actually

00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,390
do two Yocto compiled two or three

00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,159
kernels at the same time on the same

00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,200
beaut people what people say that so

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,620
it's possible we did at there because we

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,590
needed to generate be able to the

00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,780
resulting software generated be running

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,820
on the emulator directly instead of

00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:53,549
going to issue and without a needed to

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,530
have build in two times this to reduce

00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,210
the time of completion so it is this

00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,850
other thing that we can say today and

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,250
based on the previous experience the

00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,070
current projects the same software that

00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,110
we are generating on the Butte for the

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,140
car can be run in an emulator at the

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,280
same time so we have the real experience

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,090
directly and it makes the life of

00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,090
developer easier

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:27,010
yes also it's the project that comes in

00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,800
this way that the the whole car assembly

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:32,680
design is made by the matrix in Munich

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,380
that's design we have we are directly

00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,810
part of the project of self-driving and

00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,700
we are doing the base system but we are

00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:43,420
connected to the self-driving team so it

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:46,780
is in the end we are doing the soft

00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:49,330
ravine project completely that's exactly

00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,640
we connect so everything there it is

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,930
it's already building on top of what you

00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,930
are doing during this process

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:16,630
at this moment no one we are not going

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:18,160
to hypervisors can do we yeah it

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,020
actually it's depending of the course

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,730
and then how he actually said this is

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,890
the question is related to him this is

00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,740
one thing is about separations of

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:32,200
utilization so you can actually separate

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:34,360
what is running there ya know not to

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,710
have a hypervisor exactly this it

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,740
started during runtime there so we can

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,570
you you can actually can can can control

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,370
exactly what is in one part on another

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,550
one we don't need to have an Ivor visor

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,180
we have monitors of course but not an

00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:54,040
hypervisor

00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:57,550
in the sense this is and yes we

00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,530
evaluated some hypervisor saying there's

00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:02,020
no need to use herbs risers at this

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:05,410
moment we don't actually have the needed

00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,960
for that this is so many layers on the

00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,550
top there is already and provider will

00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,670
be just complicated things and not

00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:15,640
actually have a be you need really

00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:17,920
usability this may be change in the

00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:25,630
future because next project coming so

00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:28,600
there you go okay so basically you still

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,780
have five minutes so if not have any

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,120
more questions I'll be around here so

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:37,960
please ask thanks for your presence here

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:42,880
and my email is there feel free to email

00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:45,580
me and go again we're going full Linux

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,690
we're not joking about that it's

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:51,940
official and if you look in on the press

00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,530
so you're not only us the software

00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,840
project to have a cooperation with

00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:59,170
Mercedes that we we are working the same

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,870
project as well so it so it goes big

00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,700
it's just take time and the whole safety

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:08,600
and everything you see that would take

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,680
some time okay thank you everyone

00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,680
