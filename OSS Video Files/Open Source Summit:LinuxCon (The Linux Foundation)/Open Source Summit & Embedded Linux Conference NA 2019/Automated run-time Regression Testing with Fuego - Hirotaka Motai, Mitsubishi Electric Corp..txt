	Automated run-time Regression Testing with Fuego - Hirotaka Motai, Mitsubishi Electric Corp.

Real-time applications need to satisfy timing constraints, and we have to avoid kernel changes which might cause long delays. But we need tons of time for testing to detect those issues. So, it is the reason why we use automated testing frameworks.We presented our test with "Fuego" in ELCE2018, which not only measures performance but also traces for detecting what cases delay. Now, we have developed Functional-test run-time logger which measure the amount of time required to finish the functional test, to get clues to detect internal problem even if all of the testâ€™s results is success. In this presentation we will share the detail of the run-time logger in Fuego with showing our actual use case.
