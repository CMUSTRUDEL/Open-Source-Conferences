	AIC: Hosting Multiple Interactive Physical Clients on Single Computing Platform for IOT - Bin Yang

Mobile OSes, such as Android, have spread to non-smartphone use cases such as in-vehicle infotainment, and physical retail stores. These scenarios often require the installation of multiple standalone mobile devices to simultaneously serve different users. Meanwhile, computing capacity has increased quickly even on relatively low-cost computing platforms. To reduce the total cost of ownership, it is natural to ask: Is it possible to host multiple simultaneously interactive mobile clients on a shared computing platform?This topic presents AIC, a system to support multiple simultaneous interactive clients on a shared computing device. AIC reduces total cost of ownership, lowers management overhead, and supports dynamic sharing of system resources. AIC offers every client a full mobile OS instance that is virtualized based on container-like OS virtualization technology.
