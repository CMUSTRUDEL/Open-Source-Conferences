	AIC: Hosting Multiple Interactive Physical Clients on Single Computing Platform for IOT - Bin Yang

Mobile OSes, such as Android, have spread to non-smartphone use cases such as in-vehicle infotainment, and physical retail stores. These scenarios often require the installation of multiple standalone mobile devices to simultaneously serve different users. Meanwhile, computing capacity has increased quickly even on relatively low-cost computing platforms. To reduce the total cost of ownership, it is natural to ask: Is it possible to host multiple simultaneously interactive mobile clients on a shared computing platform?This topic presents AIC, a system to support multiple simultaneous interactive clients on a shared computing device. AIC reduces total cost of ownership, lowers management overhead, and supports dynamic sharing of system resources. AIC offers every client a full mobile OS instance that is virtualized based on container-like OS virtualization technology.

okay let's we start let's start of their

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,500
presentation so thanks for joining the

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,320
session

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,080
my name is Sabine young and the soft

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,740
engineer works for intel corporation

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,830
based in Saha so today I will introduce

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:24,330
our professor Nader

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,849
host the hosting multiple in activity

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:32,279
physical clients I'm single computing

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:35,340
plentiful so this is the agenda we were

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,489
introduced why we try to recently to

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,500
professor and the backgrounder and use

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,960
case a be handed a proposal first year

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,010
and in whom we work to go through that

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,800
Khadijah and construe the detailed

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,600
implementation of our solutions and then

00:00:49,800 --> 00:01:02,039
we were provided are you a real estate

00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:04,890
and give you a summary okay okay as we

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,920
know there are three how has it become

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,090
the most popular operating system in the

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,670
world

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,729
you most of cater enjoy a Android OS is

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,380
you stay in the mobile phone and tablet

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:23,210
and the TV but do to reach ecosystems

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,920
and meaning meaning of that an

00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,350
application development I'm joy

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,200
assistance I had been used as a sopretty

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,479
that was an emerging use cases such as

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,890
gimme and the automotive were and retail

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:42,119
the first page the first picture is

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,890
automotive in the modern cars there was

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,350
a lot of displays

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:53,610
installed in a car to to give the

00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:56,880
passengers and telemental service for

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,250
example a you know concept car provided

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,710
below audience there was a 17 displays

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:07,950
in a wanker Erica did in the RV displays

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,319
needed to provide independent

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,140
interaction to different passengers at

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,270
Santa so

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,520
so this is a first I escaped the

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,860
secondly the color gaming collar kami is

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,790
trying to run the case on the cloud and

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,920
rendering and the encoding and the

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:32,580
sender in college streaming to the users

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,520
mobile device use the user gaming

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,770
machines it can't let a user it's a

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,490
provider the user experience wrong

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,040
anywhere at any time and it also can

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:48,060
reduce the effort toward distributor and

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,660
the maintain new games the father I'm

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:56,640
julissa which is which also have a

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:59,580
bigger important in Game Master forgive

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,970
them more in China more than 50 percent

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,790
of the cases are more an Joey GaSe and

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,610
most of the 21 players again campanilla

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,150
follow the rule you strategy that a

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,280
mobile faster so agile gimmies also an

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,500
important topic or put your important

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:23,970
you skater form for Android for with her

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:26,310
resources said your case we know Alibaba

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,709
and Marvin reached and Jochen scepter

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:33,989
about the Narita and free stuff retail

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,640
indecent retail store there was a lot of

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,650
discipline which provided check how the

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,519
service and the word high terminal

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,709
services to the customers user can

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,250
interact with the different display at

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:53,010
the same title reduces service duration

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:55,380
so so this is said I guess case the

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:57,390
first case isn't robert the service

00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,330
property is also very hot in China

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,850
especially for the education at the home

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:08,190
and the guided service at the hospital

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:11,610
or other Bank so traditionally the

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,760
service robot is proba is included to

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,590
always why is Ross always which is used

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,260
to connect the sensor data and the

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,810
culture the robot and the other is the

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,600
enjoy which is try to interact with the

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,870
customers except the commander foreign

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,470
customers

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:33,310
and controller Roberta Ross always and

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:36,970
get the feedback of total customers so

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:40,419
all use cases or try to leveraging the

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,660
bigger ecosystem of Android and also

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:45,580
require reach the Samuel requirement

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,470
behind the use cases we can't find

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,419
though you can request assistance to

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,419
service different users at the same time

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:58,870
without interfere with each other and

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:01,080
the second point is is a request

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,260
assistance to support a mixture

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:14,800
different abilities based on voice so

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:17,800
this is our point okay so to to satisfy

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,860
the requirement behind it the use cases

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,410
the East Russia just use a much

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,870
motivated you can use a lot of devices

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,150
it was so a different customers while

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,080
you one device and service of our users

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,750
it isn't quickly solutions not either

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:40,780
will not bring any software develop in

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:43,330
the effort but it's a well also pre high

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,870
culture and the complicity let's take an

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:52,450
example as as I mentioned in the first

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:56,650
page of the concept car if we use if the

00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:59,110
car has 17 displays we use Android based

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,669
device to Beca every day for power I

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,860
read it later

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,949
it'll me say we need a yeast or 17

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,440
displays in the car which bring high

00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,870
cost or for the hardware and bring

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,789
bigger air for the about the management

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,820
because you'll need an app data you need

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:20,620
to do the security updated unity the OTA

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:23,380
update for all devices so this this is

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,990
solution 1 the solution to is new hosta

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,849
enjoy floor work of course we can change

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,630
the engine or go to support multiple

00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:34,479
display set to let a user to let the

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:37,000
Android to support a different user to

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,490
in actions at the same time but it also

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,980
can achieve the highest

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,680
performative because he can support he

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,520
didn't support multi uses of the

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,130
framework layer but it's also bring big

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,400
effort to implement this feature because

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:56,920
you will need modify the a lot house

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,460
sort code you know MJ HP for example the

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:03,160
AMAs activity manager services um a so

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,770
you as a manager seven user and the EMS

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,840
package management services and you when

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,240
you'll need changes a window manager

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,110
services so a lot of so the code that

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,350
should be touched and modified and it

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:20,170
also bring bigger mental effort because

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,840
it is how to persuader Google to accept

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:26,650
dispatched so you need the maintain this

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,720
Apache so because I'm J will be

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,570
upgrading the area so you need a

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,430
maintain the bigger effort will give us

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:37,630
a bigger effort to maintain dispatches

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:40,080
of Rwanda data to NL other dated and the

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,430
last one is low isolation because the

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,140
market display the materials are

00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,760
supporting the you know Frank layer it

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,300
Amin see the hard to isolate a

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,500
provider's John isolated to the

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,530
different customers it is hard to

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,800
provide a different equation to

00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,540
different customers maybe there is a

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,630
high property users won't together

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,940
better using appearance is it happened

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:07,180
to implementing in modification

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:16,990
solutions motive for occur in house of

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:19,930
solutions so so based on this congruent

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,820
we reached our solutions we try to

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,990
consolidate the enjoyable kalota

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,890
a single complaint in for using

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,300
container solutions

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:33,310
so with these solutions which was we've

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,680
run a single Cana and the basin and his

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,450
single cannot there was a different

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,090
enjoying instantaneous use the basis

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,930
stacker isolated by the container by the

00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:46,420
name spacer and secure Rupa and the this

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,700
solution can reduce the Hardwick acosta

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,880
because only one computing planner phone

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,440
can support a lot of user data center

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,560
and it also come

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,110
due to the work and effort because we

00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,980
avoided a bigger modification in our CP

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,470
in the foreign world the set up the one

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,120
in the center of the world Testament set

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,730
the benefit is reduced the maintainer

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,570
management effort because most of the

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:16,180
modification is auto enjoy us appear so

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,520
we can upgrade our solutions in the

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:23,670
forum and to pee from heat to kill

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:26,170
quickly so comparing with some

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,070
virtualization solutions we also can

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:34,440
provide some coder performance because

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:37,630
we just isolated a process in who uses a

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,400
sycophant limit space so our performance

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:44,110
should appear near the native

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:47,070
performance so the last thing is the

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,690
stability become supporter different

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:54,760
more Android stands as a single

00:09:49,690 --> 00:10:01,660
computing power on the phone ok this is

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:05,230
our solution the arc for our temperature

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:08,040
for our solutions the red figure

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,180
introduced the hardware and the software

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,540
from the figure we can see there is a

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,540
single computing planner phones which

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,940
include some pre build the hardware such

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,330
as the USB controller display controller

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:26,740
chip unit subpoena Ethernet and we also

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:30,810
have some external devices such as HTML

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:35,130
kaabah and USB cable and the HTML audio

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:37,680
so that your the external hardware

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,550
devices are connected to the hardware

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,540
computing power and authority reactant

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:46,839
is through the HDMI port or USB port so

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,690
based on our computing platform we use a

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,370
single kernel to host a different enjoy

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:58,270
instance there were for Android

00:10:51,370 --> 00:11:01,060
installation which you can reach ever be

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,890
isolated by each other so every Andrew

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:07,240
instance will be assigned to a dedicated

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:09,399
said our extension how do I use

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,509
for example the instance a new instance

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:17,670
of one will be assigning to the left

00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:21,850
display and the left USB touch

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,980
so with this or not the different user

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,619
can interact we interacted with

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:33,009
different angel instance through the

00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:38,559
different IO devices with the customers

00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:41,800
a tanto oh well there are the interact

00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:44,290
with the single computed Rena phone so

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:48,040
besides is a under instances we also

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,889
have how instance manager which you wish

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,119
you will be responsible for the left

00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:54,339
controlling of their lifecycle of the

00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:59,649
analyzer forget them pointer will be

00:11:54,339 --> 00:12:02,290
useful to start/stop post with you enjoy

00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:05,050
the dedicated on your instance it also

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:09,579
can be checking little status I wonder

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:12,999
if stays peace in the field based on the

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:17,110
leaf ARCA we can see we can supporter we

00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:19,389
can enjoy on the old one milik spaced

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,809
away so we can support any different and

00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:24,939
in space away the for example loss

00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:30,429
reactor and event or on the single kana

00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:32,860
and we implement we integrate our

00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:35,350
instance manager and and resistance with

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,589
the talker and the covenants so it can

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:43,319
be easy to deploy des and the management

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,319
through the crowd and talker commander

00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:54,160
under the one Caesar I want to it was

00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:56,920
into noting is that our solution is we

00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,629
have extended our modification out how

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:05,790
from OCP we implement a most of them our

00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:09,759
modification in the our hardware

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:12,369
Hardware adapter layer so which is auto

00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,110
from USP and the kernel and we know how

00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:17,799
I am intended by the window and

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,870
associate a horrible when the USB so

00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,730
maintained by the Cougar

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,089
and tonight I'm intended by the name of

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:29,950
the foundation enter an OTP sir Koda

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:34,000
will be upgraded once it was a year and

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:37,660
the canova be updated quickly so with

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,920
our design we with our know interactive

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:45,550
design we can move most of the Reedy

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,370
carpenter our solution from HP and

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:58,839
Connor so that we can upgrade our

00:13:48,370 --> 00:14:02,620
solution quickly so we have introduced

00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:05,589
the arc of our solutions so of course

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,230
because the four different use case may

00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:10,360
be you have a different feature said

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,190
that you know obstacle forget number

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,589
four the colonel gave me it is different

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,910
for the use case for the LG g4 the

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,310
current game II there was a later IO

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:23,230
device user the most important is the

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:25,720
density and the GPO GPO rendering so so

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:29,709
the arc may be how executor maybe have a

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,110
sounds more changes so we will go

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,120
through our implementation so we were

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,970
introduced to the container colonel

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:41,410
modification and i/o virtualization de

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:44,170
fe modification so how do we introduced

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,779
at the beginning the most important

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:50,170
technology we our solution based our

00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:52,540
container container is it's a

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,520
combination of the name is beta and the

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,190
group on what is an m-space an

00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,620
emancipation is a feature provided by

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:02,830
kernel which which can be used at or

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:06,970
isolator a set of process so either

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:08,970
include the sign name space let's walk

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,529
in the mr. Bates Mountain mr. Bates and

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,890
IPC name interface and the piadina mr.

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:18,070
Bates and the parabola and so with the

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:19,959
name is Mason weaker isolated different

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,620
Andrew instance the u.s. debate used

00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:26,850
user basis talk by each others so the

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:30,490
one process in container one can't be

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,080
communicated with the process tour in

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,610
container to without the

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,899
the yes and see Krupa is a any other

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:42,649
technology provided about Connor

00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:45,560
it's a provide a solution to assign a

00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,230
different resource such as CPU and

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,940
memory to different name space for

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:55,459
example you can dine maybe 400 memory to

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,519
the Container 1 and 2 have 2 GB memory

00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:00,800
to the container to with container

00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,510
support we can provide the difference of

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,700
property to the different engine

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:11,450
container so the other we can maybe we

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:15,019
can give more importance to the had some

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:20,899
sign stands and give no importance to

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:27,079
other instances so this is the

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:30,320
modification in Connor so as we know the

00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:36,860
finder is the most important module is

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:41,149
an G which is being the kernel and the

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,640
heater provides the service to enjoy

00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:46,310
this process for the communication for

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,380
example if the processor one want to

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:51,020
communicate with the processor to you

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,520
know one in enjoy water

00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,930
it's an either standard messaging

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,820
through the binder and the panda were

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,610
transfer the message' to the process

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,260
tool so you know only design the binder

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,950
talented supporter multi and you

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:06,079
instances so the straightforward the

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,390
solution is just a modified sort code or

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,720
binder and other maybe I'm we can add a

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:15,709
data structure such as Lister into the

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:20,780
binder so decoder and maps every node

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:22,610
indicates Lister to a new instance we've

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,439
made a pure C butter is a bring a lot of

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,900
modification in the kernel with a

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,960
bringer powder once understood code in

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,580
O'Connor which is hard to maintain and

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,700
upgrade so we choose a different

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,010
solution we create a mat for by the

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,929
instance binder the Western odor in

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:45,220
O'Connor and we assign different binding

00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:46,910
not device to different I enjoy instance

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,550
with this Russia

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,880
no modification you and your CPC

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,060
required you see sir very clear

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,550
solutions

00:17:53,060 --> 00:18:01,790
so the on the other hand the different

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:04,160
binder per than into different hundred

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:08,450
instances it means the isolation between

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:12,710
different between the different and

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:15,100
restated so it's better so with with

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,600
this solution we just only modify

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:25,520
tonight some code to you neighbor the

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:28,250
much more - so we know for the most for

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,350
the how to use Katie's the motion is how

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:35,720
virtualization solutions so we regroup

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,500
or or IO divided into two parts one two

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,560
types

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,410
why is dedicated all devices and the

00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,660
other is a shadow IO devices for the

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:48,170
dedicated IO devices are you which means

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:52,120
the HDMI it's prayer HDMI audio and USB

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:55,670
camera and used to be totally keyboard

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:58,550
these the all devices are assuming the

00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:03,380
data it'll be a dinosaur for different a

00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:05,840
and your instance so we we standard your

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:09,200
you need to assign it for different the

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,720
to assign the different dedicated

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,080
devices for different to different and

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,770
you instance so for the shared our

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:22,070
devices such as graphics video trusting

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:25,130
the sensor we add a new heart into the

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:28,130
cross instant steamer and also leave

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,950
some we shall our in the Android

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,500
instance what we use no wish a hard on

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,350
you instance because we try to avoid the

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,600
motif modify the source code you know I

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:47,210
used to be directory we try to keep our

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:50,000
used to be Karina so this is dedicated

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:53,360
our devices for example we have with let

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,860
me take the USB input as example when we

00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,170
plug multiple USB display did USB input

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,260
divisor the kuno will be helpful to

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,470
create a

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,760
the West node so choose the similar

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,660
solution with the binder

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,990
we thank different input device in order

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,570
to different and your instance so

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,370
similar to the binary solution we have

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,520
nothing to change the either Angelo

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:23,010
Sookie and because all devices are

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:28,800
password so there is no performance

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:30,660
overhead in these solutions for I was

00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,000
sharing that you are sharing the device

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,490
share the divisor it is a more

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,920
complicated lot so we take a graph isn't

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:42,720
it's periodic example for most of the

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,220
hardware there was only are only one

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,460
it's pretty controller in the hardware

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,010
and only one displayed controller driver

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,340
in the Kerner and in most of the cases

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,770
the history grower has a controller has

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,890
a requirement that data only one process

00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:02,000
member cezzah can accept the driver so

00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:05,340
so that we need the critter this pratima

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,400
reneedar display composer which is

00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,020
running across instances or instances to

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,950
interact with the display driver

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,410
directory so we have two modifications

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:20,670
one is a display compose driver the

00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:24,300
other uses a grog Vihara and hard work

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,340
composer we have so for the world either

00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:30,060
Andrew instance when Joseph's finger

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:33,840
tried to create a framework frame buffer

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:37,230
interval called goloka we holla and grow

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,050
local we have velcro real Greylock how

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:44,760
to allocated a buffer at the same time

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:47,370
the colloquy how we're getting a ft for

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:51,000
the frame buffer and

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:53,100
Scheider with the display composer so

00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,930
the buffer has been shared between that

00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:00,720
is click composer and the enjoy instance

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:03,630
so andrew instance can do any operation

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,880
on the frame buffer with other as the

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:10,730
orangie data so there is no nothing

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,730
let me know any overhead in the

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,650
frame buffer operation so weather and

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,050
reasoning to try to send this buffer to

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:22,350
the display hardware so heat worsen that

00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:26,390
is preview questa so currently so the

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:30,570
harderberg composer we have captured

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:33,290
display requester and redirected this

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:36,240
display of credit or disagree composer

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:39,900
and this pre composer which is running

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,670
at the demo we're at scepter or display

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,340
compose display request the front in

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:48,360
front and Joey instance and merging into

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:50,640
a single display request and under then

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,580
is inactive either display controller

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,980
driver so we started to play composer to

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,280
help we can avoid the complicated

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:05,429
between differend and your instance we

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:10,470
avoided a screen and / and we can bring

00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:12,450
later over header on other graphics try

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:17,150
to support of different host away so we

00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:20,550
also provided a different back-end for

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,990
different back-end for different the

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:25,740
whole story the for example we probe the

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:34,550
enjoy x1 well we rendered yeah I'm back

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:38,450
end for different host always okay so

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:43,200
our little patches

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:45,720
USB to enable our solutions but we have

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,360
some enhancement attaches so for example

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,460
the first one is touching it or no

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,450
memory kira as we know no Marikina is a

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,820
mechanism provided by the nearest which

00:23:53,450 --> 00:24:00,600
will help to select the best attended

00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:04,890
data of the process to killed when the

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:08,070
thesis memory pressure is very big with

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,830
a very heavy so the image in the andrey

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:14,850
well will be responsible for updating

00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,980
the adage away into low kernel and the

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:20,370
kernel where selected the best Akali

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,429
data in O'Connor and Oscar the your

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,450
space to hear it but for our party this

00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:26,550
Russia

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,650
provided but in the providers of water

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:33,060
for the multiple enjoy extensive

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:35,610
so we Jose it we assign different await

00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:41,820
according to different the property I

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:44,460
was at different distances so the even

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,680
the background processing in the high

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:50,220
property and receives aware not will be

00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,470
killed and later because of we want to

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:57,330
provide a high property were so easy to

00:24:52,470 --> 00:25:01,410
the high property customers so this is

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,830
just a small changes okay just for five

00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,940
minutes

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:08,460
so we have introduced the arc and after

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,910
challenge implementation of our solution

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:15,960
that we came by escape so as we

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:17,910
mentioned we have we implement POC for

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,270
the current gaming with our solution

00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:24,740
this is general rock for the curve gave

00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:26,880
me the left is the mobile devices which

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,190
display the video streaming and I

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,980
capture the user input and a central

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:34,080
server and in the cell so we have a GPU

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,410
points if you poor which joob joob

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,210
Rajapur scipio will be refundable for

00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,880
round the logic of the application and

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,070
the gpo been round the Robie with

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,730
multiple for ron doing the encoding

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:52,770
under the register is game server which

00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:57,630
is running the case with logic so this

00:25:52,770 --> 00:26:01,200
is a detailed ARCA for our solutions the

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:04,680
left is the GP poor the rat is left you

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:09,480
see people already search if you put the

00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:12,150
moon as we can see the user cup user

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,580
have user action or user touches where

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,850
be captured and ascended to the server

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,370
and a rebel injector to our Android

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,640
instance and which were drawn with a

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:27,690
silly scenario change

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:30,690
Yuda against the Egyptian command for

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:34,890
the case where we captured by our

00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,340
graphics in rendering module and we send

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:40,900
it to the

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:44,560
gpo pour through the tcp/ip stack and

00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,630
the English people are the rules Renta

00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:52,240
we receive about the car the package

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:55,000
other tcp/ip Thetas and Senate to the

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,300
GPU and Alaska GPO to R and we and the

00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,600
encoding finally the video streaming

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:07,840
webOS in the packet or the CPU server

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:12,700
and let's suppose to make a audio/video

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:15,280
sink and send it back to the devices so

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,950
this is a real skater for the kilala

00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:21,880
gaming which we implement in there

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:25,810
enjoying container solutions okay

00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:30,130
we have only one minutes so let me give

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:33,100
my summary so we proposed and the

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:35,680
provider consolidate solution to

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,350
consolidate the many enjoy workload in a

00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:41,350
single campaign single computing planner

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,720
phone using container solutions which is

00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:46,270
suitable for a lot power imagine use

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,920
cases such as current gaming automotive

00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:55,410
or and out here we design a simple

00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:58,690
service or design patterns to reduce the

00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:02,310
parameter Waheeda we implement we design

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:06,190
our knowing chassis design to reduce

00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:09,640
mental effort and we can upgrade our

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:12,640
solutions you to wonder that when out of

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,770
the quickly so next time we plan to

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,560
improve the isolation security our

00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:20,110
solutions because currently we just use

00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,390
a container solution to isolate the

00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,880
different a new instance and we also try

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,730
to make some POC to mix the different

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,000
and it's based on ovation for Frankie

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:38,140
number we can made a Ross always and

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:41,550
enjoy running on a single O'Connor's ok

00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,550
