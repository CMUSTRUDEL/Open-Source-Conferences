	Lightning Talk: Living on the Edge - Computing as the Next Battleground - Arpit Joshipura, General Manager of Networking, The Linux Foundation

Edge Computing is one of the hottest new markets enabling new applications like AR/VR/360/IOT/Drones among others. This short talk will help define Edge computing, its killer applications and top vertical markets ready for primetime use of edge and give an overview of a unified open source umbrella “LF Edge” that brings Enterprise, IOT, Telecom and Cloud Edges together through projects like Akraino, EdgeX Foundry, EVE, HomeEdge and Glossary of Edge”

all right it's very interesting that a

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:11,700
talk on edge computing is placed at a

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,679
very edge of the keynote session but I

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,640
can tell you it is the next big thing

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:22,350
and it is going to be a four trillion

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,910
economy by 2030 that's four times bigger

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,019
than cloud computing so if you missed

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,179
that first wave here's your chance so

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:34,130
what I'm gonna do is in the next five

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:37,590
minutes tell you why edge is important

00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:40,440
what is edge what are the killer apps

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,390
that go with it in which vertical

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,210
markets and then of course what Linux

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,829
Foundation is doing to enable the edge

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:51,780
from a unified open-source perspective

00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,910
let's start at the bottom here there is

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,469
a convergence of five technology

00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,980
elements that is driving this edge

00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:04,619
compute phenomena right

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:08,490
there's 5g for those of you who know 4G

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,159
5g is bigger better faster lower latency

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,710
all that good stuff but the fundamental

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,990
reason why edge is relying on 5g is

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,299
because of low latency the second is

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,990
micro services so this is where

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,439
applications can be written and portable

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,060
through containers in any environment

00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,369
okay right now the only portable app

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,650
that we know that can be taken across

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,689
the globe is a cell phone all right you

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,960
cannot take any other app physical or

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,079
virtual across any of the limits so

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,670
that's very important ai at the edge is

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,500
very important for predictive

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,079
maintenance and analytics and it's

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,540
matured enough along with a whole bunch

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,850
of hardware and and of course the last

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,950
piece of the puzzle is on-demand network

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,340
that Jim was you know making fun of or

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,979
talking about what these convergence of

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,049
five technologies bring is it brings a

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,810
whole new set of applications for the

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,979
IOT and analytics systems for immersive

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,860
experiences like VR AR 360 video for

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,710
autonomous devices drones cars etc and

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,660
and and essentially these are the apps

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,970
are going to take advantage of the low

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,860
latency and accelerated processing at

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,730
the edge so this is why this is so

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,290
exciting of course like any market what

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,100
is the killer app where do I make money

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,870
right and it's early in the market but

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,770
if you were to summarize and ask me what

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,750
are the factors that determine the app

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,880
and and the nature of killer apps it is

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,640
nontraditional video so it's not the

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,390
youtubes and anything that is connected

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,770
that moves but is not a phone okay those

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,830
are the big killer apps for for the edge

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:55,110
in terms of the markets the verticals

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,780
that are dependent on the power of edge

00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,330
compute are written in this slide and by

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,740
the way they're in a linear order

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,350
industrial manufacturing is the highest

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,180
followed by energy oil and gas commerce

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,160
retail home automotive and fleet and

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,320
transportation the others are important

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,670
but there are policies and and

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,430
regulations that will slow down the

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,920
adoption these markets are already

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,590
participating in the communities to

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,700
drive em edge computing closer to their

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,190
apps the next question what is edge

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,680
where are the edges and this is a very

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,340
simple diagram left to right on the top

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,990
left you have the on-prem Enterprise

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,660
manufacturing building hospital you name

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,520
it edge where there are devices and

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,800
connected things on the bottom we all

00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,710
know that that's the house home that's

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,540
the home edge one hop in is the base

00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,820
stations from a telecom perspective

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,010
brought in to a telco smart central

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,840
office and then you move in to a

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,540
centralized data center like an Amazon

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,850
or Google and all the key definition

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,900
that we believe that the community has

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:04,500
embarked on is anything that is got

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,890
proximity of compute and storage got a

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,850
latency element to it so 20 milliseconds

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,520
or less latency response and an element

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,630
of mobility is what is categorized as

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,640
edge okay

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,250
so what are we doing we're doing a

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,770
project under the context of what is

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,530
called LF edge umbrella and it consists

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,060
of five projects to more in incubation

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,750
another 10 in pipe

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,240
line the projects our Eve I don't have

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,280
time in to go to all of them but Eva's

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,460
the edge virtualization that sits on the

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,710
Prem the equivalent of that is the home

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:45,120
edge as it connects all of our home into

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,910
a classic API economy and then there's

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,410
an there's a project college X foundry

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,419
which is kind of the anchor IOT

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,840
framework and then of course a crane o

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,669
which is a telecom use-case project but

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,880
also brings the end-to-end blueprints

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:02,729
these are the projects that make up LF

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,370
edge and when you put these projects in

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,380
context of other open-source projects

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,690
and standards here's how the world looks

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,060
you start off with the left you got

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,430
projects like Oran which is a telecom

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,860
radio access network where Phi G comes

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,630
in then you have all the access projects

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,910
and then they are going to interact with

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,030
a whole bunch of projects on the core

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,250
like onap which is the diagram you saw

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,740
on the automation kubernetes OpenStack

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,080
accumulate cetera and then the standards

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,440
that go with it are obviously on the

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,640
right hand side Etsy at CMAC automotive

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,770
edge computing so this is where

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,270
connected cars define the standards on

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,550
how they're going to come in and

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,360
interact with VH compute and then of

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,960
course IIC from that perspective so to

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,940
sort of summarize LF edge launched just

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,090
this year with the highest number of

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,430
founding members you know 60 plus 7 plus

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,280
project 70 plus members growing very

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,580
significantly and the goal of LF edge is

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,169
to unify the fragmented market where you

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,180
know you have a cloud edge and an

00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:09,930
enterprise edge and an IOT edge and now

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:13,350
a telco edge right how can I do a single

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:17,070
framework with common API is abstracted

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,750
connectivity and and standard lifecycle

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,900
management we which we also call

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,430
plumbing so if you're not part of LF

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,789
edge you know please go to the website

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,270
lfh org you can reach me after this talk

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,410
we'd love to have you participate and

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,180
remember if you miss the first wave of

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,330
cloud computing this is four times

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,880
bigger four trillion in 2030 so thank

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,110
you very much and enjoy the rest of the

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,949
talks
