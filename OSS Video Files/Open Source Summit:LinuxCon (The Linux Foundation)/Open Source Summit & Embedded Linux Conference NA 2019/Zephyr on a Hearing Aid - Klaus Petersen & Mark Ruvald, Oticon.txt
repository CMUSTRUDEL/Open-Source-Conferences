	Zephyr on a Hearing Aid - Klaus Petersen & Mark Ruvald, Oticon

The adventure of porting Zephyr to a hearing aid, a life-changing device that uses almost no power, almost no space and will be produced in millions.This is the story of molding Zephyr into a project that also supports the most exotic development environments, like those found in the making of an FDA approved medical device like a hearing aid sold to millions of users.The challenges, to name a few;- Zephyr as a modular component- Porting Zephyr to a custom processor- Making Zephyr (bluetooth stack) endianess portable- Supporting a fully proprietary toolchain- Improving and generalizing tracing infrastructure&nbsp;- Making it run with a lemon as a battery
