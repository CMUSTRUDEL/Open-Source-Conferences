Description: 
	Lightning Talk: Build a Reproducible ML Workflow with Kubeflow Pipelines - Karl Weinmeister, Manager, Cloud AI Advocacy, Google

Solving a data science problem is an iterative exercise. It requires running experiment after experiment â€” &nbsp;trying new approaches with different parameters and lots of data. To manage this complexity, it is very helpful to have a platform to build reusable workflows that can be tracked.Kubeflow Pipelines is a component of the Kubeflow open-source project, focused on building and deploying portable ML workflows on Docker containers. In this session, the audience will learn about KubeFlow Pipelines and how it can help improve reuse and reproducibility of the machine learning process.

hey everybody thanks for the opportunity

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,660
to speak with you all today I'm going to

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,840
talk about an open source project called

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,519
cube flow and it brings some of the

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,960
great things that you see in the DevOps

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,880
world and traditional software

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,510
development to the world of machine

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,980
learning so the first point I want to

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,779
make is the machine learning and

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,029
software development are really kind of

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,490
blending together so a lot of the

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,099
algorithms that were invented for

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,830
machine learning really are decades old

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,559
but over time through incremental

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,800
improvement and some bigger improvements

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,960
especially with improvements in compute

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,149
and storage capability in the last

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,579
decade we've seen sort of this threshold

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,620
being crossed where machine learning is

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,980
solving all kinds of new problems that

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,260
it wasn't able to before and so now what

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,719
we're seeing is that most recently

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,930
machine learning is just another way of

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,050
solving problems instead of having a

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,210
rule-based approach you're inferring the

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,489
rules from learning by example

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,119
so just one more way to do things more

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:12,720
and more businesses are using AI and so

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,659
one of the open challenges is a lack of

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,040
lifecycle management and what I mean by

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,080
that is that machine learning modeling

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,350
is really one small piece of the overall

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,020
process you might have many data sources

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,810
you need to clean them transform them

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,259
validate the data and you need to do

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,720
that in a deterministic way okay

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:39,360
secondly mmm-hmm data science is all

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,119
about experimentation trying new things

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,119
experimenting seeing if this works or

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,939
that it that works and so tracking each

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,649
run is really essential and so what

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,020
we're seeing now is it like in the

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,240
academic world one of the largest

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,090
conference is called nerds is now not

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,950
just taking results from papers it wants

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,590
to see everything that went into

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,990
creating that result the data the

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,240
process the infrastructure that was used

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,970
so it's great to see that this issue is

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,510
receiving some attention and growing

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,340
visibility so with that I want to

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,170
introduce cube flow

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,340
here's the mission statement for it so a

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,299
few things that I want to point out

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,599
there one is that it makes it easy for

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:26,400
everyone so beginners that want sort of

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,840
some sensible defaults as well as

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,840
advanced practitioners that need to

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,480
customize things it allows you to do the

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,129
full lifecycle of machine learning on a

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,560
kubernetes infrastructure so it's

00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:40,379
portable so you can run it on premise in

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,000
the cloud multi cloud and it's

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,780
distributed so you can kind of run these

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,419
large training jobs with it so here's

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,730
the dashboard really this is just where

00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:55,049
you kind of see the main activities that

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,700
you can launch from and the main sort of

00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,950
capabilities are everything from

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,049
developing a model to training that

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,569
model kind of spreading it over your

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,519
whole cluster and serving the model

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,799
which kind of can be overlooked right

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,650
once it's used in production you might

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,409
be having a heavy workload it provides

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,269
you a rest endpoint that your cluster

00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,370
can you know basically serve up the

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,780
model with and finally orchestration

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,299
that's kind of the main piece that we're

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,359
talking about today so it's all running

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:27,659
on top of a kubernetes infrastructure

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,609
most recent release uses Sto that gives

00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,790
us metrics and authorization

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,699
capabilities so what's a pipeline and

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,560
cube flow really it's just a set of

00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:39,780
predetermined steps that you define in

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,500
code and you can use some components

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,819
that we have to basically perform all

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,729
kinds of capabilities you know

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,340
downloading data training etc where you

00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,169
can write your own custom code in those

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,970
so here's an example of a pipeline

00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:55,739
written in Python this actually

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,169
something I used in a recent blog post

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,299
for retraining a model so as new data

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,970
comes around it will do a three step

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,069
process to download the new data retrain

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,750
a model and then redeploy it and you see

00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,079
that there's a pipelines SDK that

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,060
converts that into a GUI in the cube

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:12,930
flow dashboard so you can kind of see

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,959
what's going on

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,489
and this sort of all comes together when

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,769
you look at the results of your

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,779
experiment where you can see all the

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,389
different runs that you've made the

00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,070
accuracy you know was it successful so

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,889
on and so forth you can even add your

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,689
own metadata

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:31,990
teach run to kind of track what's going

00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:34,210
on so in summary what we saw today here

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,330
we learned about cube flow which is a

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,090
cloud native multi-cloud solution for

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,729
machine learning it provides you with

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,650
your own pipelines that you can build to

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:47,199
sort of match whatever you're doing in

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,770
your business and if you're running

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,900
kubernetes you can run coop flow it's an

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,520
open and inclusive community we're

00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,599
looking for people to just take a look

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,789
maybe get involved the main way to the

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,409
access cube flow is at the website but

00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:05,979
you can see there's a github slack

00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:09,729
community and etc if you want to try it

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:12,550
out today here's a link to the lab to

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,550
use it and that's it for today thank you

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,420
very much for your time

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,420
