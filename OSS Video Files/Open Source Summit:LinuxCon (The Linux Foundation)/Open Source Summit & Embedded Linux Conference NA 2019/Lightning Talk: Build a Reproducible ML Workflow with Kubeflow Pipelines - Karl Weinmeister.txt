	Lightning Talk: Build a Reproducible ML Workflow with Kubeflow Pipelines - Karl Weinmeister, Manager, Cloud AI Advocacy, Google

Solving a data science problem is an iterative exercise. It requires running experiment after experiment â€” &nbsp;trying new approaches with different parameters and lots of data. To manage this complexity, it is very helpful to have a platform to build reusable workflows that can be tracked.Kubeflow Pipelines is a component of the Kubeflow open-source project, focused on building and deploying portable ML workflows on Docker containers. In this session, the audience will learn about KubeFlow Pipelines and how it can help improve reuse and reproducibility of the machine learning process.
