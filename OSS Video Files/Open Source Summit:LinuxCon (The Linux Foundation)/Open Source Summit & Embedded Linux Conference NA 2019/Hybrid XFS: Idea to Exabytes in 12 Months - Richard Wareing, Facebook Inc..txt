Description: 
	Hybrid XFS: Idea to Exabytes in 12 Months - Richard Wareing, Facebook Inc.

This talk will be broken down into three parts:Part 1 will describe some of the challenges using many open-source file systems (e.g. ext4, XFS) with clustered storage system such as GlusterFS, HDFS or even closed source exa-byte systems.Part 2 will describe what Hybrid XFS actually is: a form of XFS where we leverage two different media types (a flash drive & traditional HDDs) along with a long forgotten feature of XFS to create a single high performing file system suitable for the demands of exa-byte scale clustered storage.And finally in part 3, Richard will delve into how we went from a discussion & patch sets on the XFS mailing list to rolling out to an entire fleet of storage servers at Facebook in only 12 months. Moving fast, and *not* breaking things.
