	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
well good morning I hope everyone's

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,340
doing great it is an honor to be here

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,950
with you today and I bet you are

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,469
wondering why Google is calling all duck

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,070
stars although I think Jim kind of give

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,859
you a little tip so the reality is is

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,859
open-source has tons of rock stars and

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,380
we have made amazing software that's

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,320
being used all around the world and

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,080
let's face it we like when people use

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,559
our software it allows us to scale

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,200
helping others and it feels kind of good

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,190
when people use our stuff so the

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,539
question is how do we get more people to

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,670
use our software and the answer is

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,140
documentation and there's lots of

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,680
research into this this is just one

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,940
survey from digitalocean that shows that

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,859
documentation is the number one driver

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,530
for adoption and it makes sense right

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,619
because documentation shows us how to

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,010
use the software and it also makes

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,939
projects more accessible so we need Duck

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,580
stars to write this documentation but we

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,520
have a problem we don't have enough dock

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,920
stars writing documentation people

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,020
contributing to documentation as you can

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,450
see in this survey only 4% of the

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,689
participants actually we're contributing

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,670
to Docs and that's a problem it's a

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,250
problem for Google and it's a problem

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,990
for our industry and it's something that

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,960
Google open-source wants to address

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,479
immediately and we did research earlier

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,369
in the year to understand what are the

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,649
blockers for people contributing to

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,369
documentation and we found that there

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:51,079
were three main blockers time support

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:54,119
and reward so as you know a contributor

00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,790
only has so much time and they're gonna

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:01,560
choose the contribution path that's easy

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,930
and rewarded and with code that's what

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,450
they get it's an easy path that's well

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,160
understood it's documented and there are

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,629
all kinds of reward and recognition

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,890
programs for the rock stars out there

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,540
but that's

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,800
simply not the case for documentation

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,680
and so we offer these pro tips to help

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,290
encourage contribution to your

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,959
documentation in your projects the first

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:29,820
pro tip is to target your first-time

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,770
contributors they are well it's a great

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,570
path to make it just easier to

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,370
contribute do you remember the first

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,970
time you contributed it was a little bit

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,370
scary

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,620
well this makes it a little less scary

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,040
offering this path but if you do choose

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,520
to go this route you need to give them a

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,340
very smooth process to know how to

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,410
contribute to documentation you have to

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,290
document how to contribute to

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,019
documentation it's a little bit meta but

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,140
it's really important and we also have

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,510
to take out the mystery of how to write

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,160
good Docs and provide templates which is

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,970
another area that we're working on right

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,370
now and then lastly we need to make our

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,660
dock stars feel valued and we need to

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,910
include them in the reward and

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,829
recognition programs that our projects

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,640
are offering and we need to include them

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:22,590
in the release notes as well so we hope

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,680
that these pro tips help you and your

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,549
projects and Google is starting to use

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,299
them too

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:32,970
but we feel a sense of urgency around

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:35,220
this topic and we want to start moving

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,560
the needle so that it's not 4%

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,500
contributing to documentation but 10 and

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,900
20% of our contributors focusing in this

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,000
area and so we are putting our money

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,850
where our mouth is and we have launched

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,850
season of Docs and as Jim explained it's

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,070
similar to our google Summer of Code but

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,410
with this program we are paying tech

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,910
writers to work with open source

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,209
projects to help them with their

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,519
documentation and I am really pleased

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,370
that this year we're going to be working

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,040
with these 50 open source projects and

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,690
we have just assigned the tech writers

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,260
to them so the work is just getting

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,700
underway and I am really excited to see

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,370
what kind of an impact we're going to

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,140
make together and also what kind of

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,630
learnings we're gonna get from this and

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,060
we will definitely be sharing all the

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,130
learnings with the greater open source

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,040
our way to give back so that we can all

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,980
improve together and so if you are

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,810
interested in season of Docs Google

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,210
Summer of Code or any of our programs

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,669
and projects please check us out on open

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,360
source google.com or you could follow us

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:46,840
on Twitter and of course don't forget to

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:51,290
thank a doc star because we need them

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,290
