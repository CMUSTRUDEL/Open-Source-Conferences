Title: Panel: The Future is Cloud Native
Publication date: 2017-06-26
Playlist: Open Source Summit Japan 2017
Description: 
	Many of today’s software-defined organizations, like Ticketmaster, ShowMax and VSCO, look to cloud native projects for crucial management and maintenance within their ever-changing infrastructures. Chris Aniszczyk, COO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, will moderate an introspective panel – featuring cloud native insiders like Keiko Harada, Ian Lewis and Eduardo Silva – to discuss how these thriving open source projects will help shape modern infrastructure. This expert panel will also address what it takes to develop meaningful cloud native systems, how these technologies fit into the overall stack, how to foster committed maintainers for emerging cloud native projects, and much more.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,450
so that's enough of an intro to CNC I

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,730
have incarnated I'll go ask our

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,320
panelists some wonderful questions so I

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,389
will

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,809
since since kubernetes was our same

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,590
project CNC up and after one of our most

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,140
important projects all kind of have a

00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:25,050
discuss 'old in terms of your background

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,170
what we do all over the Trinities

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,900
project and more importantly what's been

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,329
going on every day's 1.6 was released

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,550
lots of long ago so we created an alert

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:40,890
what was kind of new but it wasn't

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:43,129
unexpected all right sure so my my Lois

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,110
I'm the developer advocate at Google I

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:51,120
am in based charity Tokyo I looked at

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,800
Tokyo about 11 years and I'm involved

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,219
with the Carini's project in the sense

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,370
that I do a lot of kind of educating in

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,379
evangelism as well as you know being

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,100
involved with kind of side projects

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,540
things like the dashboard ey and you

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,390
know try me trying to drive some

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,189
discussions especially wrong UX such as

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:17,280
make it easier for developers to adopt

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:18,560
cooler things and so and I cover kind of

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,590
all day packs like a little

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,100
international travel

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:30,390
supporting developer communities places

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,210
like Taiwan and you do liber8 back

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,780
essentially so that's a little bit about

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,510
what I do but to kind of get to the

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:45,060
point of Bernie's and talking about 1.6

00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:47,840
so 1.6 was released I believe and that

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,470
was a it was a month ago I suppose

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:56,399
people and the kind of the main focus is

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:59,130
there were around things like security

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,759
so there was the role based access

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:08,369
control became data point 6 which is

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:10,110
kind of important for for kind of team

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,270
collaboration making sure that only

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,610
people that have access to certain types

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:21,209
of objects view them and so this was

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,940
kind of an important release for that

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:28,230
there was also a number of features that

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,110
became beta 1.6 around scheduling so a

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,200
number of the things like

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:39,530
any pot or no affinity affinity affinity

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,870
since these are kind of scheduling hints

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,530
or features that you can add to a

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,620
particular pot or to a set of containers

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:51,050
to say you know install me on this note

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,150
little more on on these types of notice

00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,860
around these types of machines and not

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,830
on these types of machines that sort of

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,260
thing as you can say you know install my

00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,930
application you know it's where there is

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,270
a GPU or where there is a certain type

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,820
of hardware that I need or within a

00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:13,730
certain network that I want to run it so

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:17,120
that's that helps a lot with kind of you

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:19,400
know providing advanced scheduling as

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,220
well as the ability to write your own

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,959
kind of custom scheduler to create

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,459
multiple schedulers within committees

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,670
and even write your own custom

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:30,380
schedulers to assign pots to nose so

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:38,540
that's another one of the major features

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:40,480
in comparison point six bingo so you

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,760
know Microsoft has definitely improved

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,180
its relationship open-source

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,920
over the years some of us who you know I

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,620
probably spent a decade of my career

00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,650
probably fighting Microsoft Canadian

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,810
that kind of wars but things you know

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,090
people could change companies to change

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,659
also if you want to speak a little bit

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,780
in terms of your involvement Microsoft

00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:09,079
what do you do and also kind of

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,299
indicator fits sure so many ways to go

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:15,200
around I learned a dream for sure

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,760
invention organization there we have a

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,190
private all operation management suite

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,289
what it is is that it's a sweet product

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,669
on cloud portal that actually has auto

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,199
backup and recovery so let's say you

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,320
want to touch the back of your hands

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,010
went on into a trilogy buna as well as

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,660
inside and analytics and then also we

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,699
have also like the security and

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,830
compliance is all too so let's see if a

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,220
customer actually wants they're more of

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,470
an active weather interesting on any

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,410
operating system or any location where

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:51,260
there's a cloud pranam or on any other

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,510
like hosting we could actually do all

00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,580
these type of insight analytics backup

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,650
in automation and oh ah so that's pretty

00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,740
much where I'm from and I'm not sure

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,000
camp there so what what I do is I

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,100
actually go out to the customers

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,200
understand what

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,000
points are and they try to actually come

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,410
up with a spec and say hey you know what

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,930
here's what we wanted to actually do

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,030
actually go for their next road map so

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,280
that's pretty much where I am and my

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,410
focus is on container monitoring and

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,310
also all the clinics agent nozzle tip so

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:24,190
in regards to open source yes so

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,290
interestingly I came from a UNIX

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,780
background I am NOT a Microsoft person

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,210
I'm actually doing Microsoft like five

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,460
years ago it's really great because it

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,900
is exactly five years I am somewhere

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,440
they actually asked a lot of question

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,750
about boring Michael talking about and

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,620
open source we use some open source of

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,590
the past but it was actually really

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,120
really rare and we don't even open up

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,840
and tell people here without open source

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,300
but there's a lot of weird customer say

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,220
hey I have a mix at nine I practice

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,060
often I love it but we have open source

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,860
what can we do and we had a really about

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,880
some transformation when a couple years

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,130
are going on so take it away

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
why don't we embrace our customer pain

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,150
point and where we honestly make sure

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,860
that open source is part of our products

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,930
as well too so that's the reason one we

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,600
actually do embrace open source really

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,480
greatly one of the good pieces I should

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,520
get home or a heavy user of comment I

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,620
was actually not presenting to a

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,960
customer and say hey here's my arm code

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,550
and it's on github and they just stare

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:31,480
at me for a while I said yes

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:33,730
is Linux so that's what it is think it's

00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,890
crazy just to see the transformation

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:39,220
because in adadz conference conference

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:41,500
recently in the US and Microsoft was the

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,780
overall top contributor to the source

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,520
based on ok now just kind of formula

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,850
which is to me it's just absolutely

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,180
crazy to see how things have changed few

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,920
years it's active out to that like Oh in

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,630
my pocket operation documentary which

00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,610
actually monitors the containers we use

00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,930
fluently heavily and of the next agent

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,510
as well too so that's another example

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,240
that we did raise pointing open source

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,520
we do so so yeah I don't know it's good

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,410
you know I think I think moderating and

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,310
I'm logging or kind of intertwined in

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,950
many ways right so you know our final

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,620
panelist Eduardo be great to kind of

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:20,170
introduce yourself your background we

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,200
can do a chartered at authority project

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:26,320
kind of we're kind of monitoring and

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,850
lobbying benefited to thank you don't my

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,030
name is Eduardo Seidman I'm a software

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:34,030
engineer at trivia and twist company but

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,940
with strong words Japan as if they know

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,190
and I say work in its blend eating I

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,100
would say team because not absolutely

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,880
probably another 20 come here but I work

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,090
in the community

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,960
ecosystem and for a does not know about

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:52,570
Wendy Fon D is a kind of open source way

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,750
we are trying to solve the whole looking

00:07:52,570 --> 00:08:00,130
collection issues that we have instead

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:02,320
of services on cloud platform so a full

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,330
team is created like an open source

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,479
project as Alamein client to

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:11,080
to collect data from the data customers

00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,599
but it was always made open-source and

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,150
is really interesting how as mod 2008

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,610
was open at the beginning is trying to

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,240
solve a specific problem for the company

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,699
and a Stimson for some reason this was a

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,979
problem that many people was was facing

00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:30,370
and not just individuals also companies

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:32,829
and when he started to grow to grow to

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,099
grow and with it tightly becomes like

00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:38,529
the de-facto solution to solve a logging

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,560
problems in companies and different

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:44,050
ecosystems and what little story which

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,390
is really fun in two years ago we were

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,019
in a conference in the u.s. links one

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:52,149
and I gave my first session I will say

00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:54,910
about fluency and once I finished my

00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,570
Sigma technical session the people from

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,550
Microsoft

00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,670
approached me and gave me a sticker

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,870
which says Microsoft love lyrics I was

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:07,829
like it was fun because I don't know if

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,329
it was a joke

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:12,370
because it's beautiful on that time

00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:16,449
things would really really be printed

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:19,089
and si and I do not have a promise and

00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:21,250
say ok but well we was the Microsoft

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,600
team that they were trying to fix the

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,930
learning products and they was

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,850
interested in to try for me actually I

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,430
could not get into much information from

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,220
that and tried I never wanted to talk to

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,610
ever but I think the few weeks later

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,829
they implemented fill in the UMS

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:42,130
interesting so and that was that was

00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:44,440
hoping open-source evolve and be part of

00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,400
this a project which is called Philippi

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,610
I will say that it's not just a

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,320
becoming a pro community and I'm proud

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,970
to say I'm not your baseball proud to

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,760
say that a huge community spirit about

00:09:52,970 --> 00:10:01,190
and we have hope we might create a fluid

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,230
is generation can be creatively big so

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,270
you're really happy about it and for

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,340
India supplying these hoping problems

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:10,070
it's becoming the de facto standard for

00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,980
different companies and I'm happy to be

00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,770
perfect so so Eduardo you know when

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,720
we're first kickin up you know CN CF you

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,910
know they started to do that context or

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,130
isolated communities came in at previous

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:25,100
and open tracing so on with twenty is

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,720
eventually became part of the kind of

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,540
scenes yet the dependent family can you

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,940
speak a little bit to kind of why you

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,550
know the foodie profit made a decision

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,580
and kind of how how has it benefited you

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:43,310
for probably it's going to move it over

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:45,320
here sure a when you're working in

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:48,110
employee lands at some point you see

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,330
that this project is going to something

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,920
bigger than you

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,470
sometimes you have to decisions but you

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,900
just keep it with yourself doing your

00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,800
own stuff or you can give it away in a

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:03,590
different form which and gross a export

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,010
and I think that the timing was perfect

00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:09,530
because was at the time that the CNC it

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,390
was being created we were in their

00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:15,110
leaders for the racial Simon conference

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:17,420
to go in some long time and they were

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,580
talking about the CN CF and it sounds

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,220
like a good idea to have reckoning

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,970
hopeful indeed but one thing is to have

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,550
an idea

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:29,350
everything is a big one task so I think

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:32,400
that that was the they worked on that so

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,640
empathy was not just my opinion

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,280
people was looking at CN CF they said

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,790
well this looks like a great house of

00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,670
Lundie

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,550
so what we can do to make stability

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,690
joint in this foundation because that

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,020
means that you're giving away the

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:52,080
project it partly will grow thanks more

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,700
and what we decided for with the

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,330
founders of the body with the government

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,340
takers

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,830
everybody please that was a really good

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,380
move and also from a company perspective

00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,680
you know there's a company behind and

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,570
initially so they the Morgan it needs to

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,120
every winner and they did it so

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,740
everybody was a because I feel like

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,070
again let's do it

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,380
let's just keep the batch license that

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:20,580
was like the personal we keep a license

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:22,830
everybody will be happy so and why do we

00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,170
need to the CNCs as noisy as it has

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,570
different brakes and they were first of

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,330
all goodies to manager orchestrations a

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,900
we have containers but also monitoring

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,480
is quite in important and log in this

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,820
part of monitoring and they were see not

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,540
like a good and logging tool for the

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,910
CNCs respect to work inside so okay we

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,010
said okay let's try Fuji let's apply and

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,040
we start the process and the process was

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:52,560
it took a couple of poems and we got a

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,950
really good technical reviews about an

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,900
ample service calls about performance

00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,930
improvements how these components can

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,880
integrate also with goodness because

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,460
it's not like in a foundation where each

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,120
project and each product is working like

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,970
a bow radius and each one can operate

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,549
really

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,649
with the own components so for example

00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:17,799
ok login with collect loss from

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:20,199
applications ok but they're running in a

00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:22,929
cluster which is orchestrated by booties

00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:25,569
so we also need to gather who will need

00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:28,239
these lot information but also there's

00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:31,239
our team who's handling like a different

00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:33,399
metrics for example these primitives to

00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:35,379
get a metal phone application and they

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,009
want to get a matrix also flow from

00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:41,019
property so when exactly is possible so

00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:43,689
quite good and we'll say we got a lot of

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:47,019
support we had to do a lot of changes

00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:49,509
but a hapless with a ended up pretty

00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:52,689
good and we are really happy because and

00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:56,049
a beautifully cheerfully legged here

00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:58,139
since we join it and as of now I can say

00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:00,699
my own opinion that was the right choice

00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,519
because boondi is not solving our

00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:08,470
problems of all problems and all complex

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:10,379
problems you know it's interesting it is

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,169
you know they've all these projects and

00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:16,149
coordinators has bless your broken and

00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:18,970
incredible paces without you know

00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:21,850
highest velocity projects on github

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:25,410
right now I think only really the kernel

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:28,600
is faster depending which metrics you

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,639
kind of look at and another way to kind

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,370
of quantify the success and adoption of

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,480
threat exists to kind of look at the

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,610
adoption by kind of large cloud

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,300
providers if you kind of look at the top

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,160
five there is a kind of communities as a

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,949
service or communities you know engine

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,560
provided within these cloud providers

00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:49,449
obviously there's you know one you know

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,829
one club back holding club are missing

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:52,870
that is not supported for days out of

00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:56,769
box but we remain nameless but you're

00:14:52,870 --> 00:15:00,009
pretty guess which one but Kato can you

00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:02,079
speak a little bit to you know I don't

00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,600
think many people realize that you know

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,329
Microsoft is supporting you know

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:11,529
everything's in a big way through its

00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:14,620
service so with an actor we have a

00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:17,130
service called container services under

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,480
the gender service a scale within their

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,050
what we do is we actually take clusters

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,550
of meows but on top of it we actually

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,110
automatically install kubernetes on top

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,610
so it is actually a customer that wants

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,319
actually use goodnight ease the

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,680
authority manager they actually go

00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:35,439
through our all marketplace select

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,509
kasyacit entity selected when he select

00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:39,370
kubernetes and it's actually that simple

00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,279
one of the biggest strong points are

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,079
like that convention is not one of those

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,970
founders were kubernetes friend

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,279
endurance was also part of Microsoft he

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,870
is part of that ACS team and he has been

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,610
a big I would go to committees that

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:55,029
creates how you can get home so with

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,800
their - office me - and my product which

00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,360
is operation entrance fee containers

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,009
called monitoring also monitors

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,990
criminate as well you know wise you can

00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,810
salinity so for us like you know

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,880
kubernetes is really large within our

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,449
organization and from our facilities as

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:14,199
much as we do here we put a lot of

00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:15,610
Trinity enough so one you know one

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,699
interesting thing I think what a benefit

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,470
of you know joining foundation like CN

00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:23,019
CF or any kind of linux foundation of

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,970
our project is you kind of have this

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,740
mutual ground where you know companies

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,689
kind of trust each other because a lot

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,389
of the IP and marks are kind of all

00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:33,189
owned by one mutual thing

00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,839
you know I think fluency has seen some

00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:38,050
of these benefits I'd argued communities

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,089
is definitely seen a lot this and one

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,220
interesting aspect is you know when

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:44,230
preventing started it was originally

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,149
kind of at Google you know and on

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,699
project and you know one thing that

00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:51,510
people may not realize is the radius

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:54,970
community with the support of CN CF has

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,829
invested a lot in improving kind of the

00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,899
diversity that you know committee

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:02,050
airship and then you know the triggers

00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:04,150
involve the project and you kind of want

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,170
to speak a little bit to you know with

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,850
what's been

00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,730
this seen some great flop set up the

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,710
last part on it's about this but um yeah

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:16,010
so originally Germany's was developed at

00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:18,500
Google release light to be very we you

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,950
know kind of developed it in-house for a

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,980
while

00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:24,400
and you know kind of released a you know

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,650
a pretty 1.0 kind of hollow Persian

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:35,240
vacuum you know the middle of it was

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:37,040
2015 nachos 2014 and the and so we

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,630
release it then and you know at that

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,450
point it was like a hundred percent you

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,870
know Google commits and you know after

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,640
that it became a project or a it was

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,410
still kind of Google owned because it is

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,890
an open source project

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:54,260
but eventually you know we did that to

00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,810
the CFCF you know we started the CN CF

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,570
to make a kind of a separate project

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,730
from cool but still for a while it was a

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,200
very much a Google led project in terms

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,750
of the number of commits a number of

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,130
developers that were actually developing

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,020
and then kind of makes sense for the

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,780
beginning of the project we were kind of

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,120
committing the architecture based on all

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,980
of our experience as equable but

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,860
eventually we need to like have a actual

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,960
community built around it so you know

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:24,340
originally was kind of built as you know

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,110
a Google thing we have our own kind of

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:30,370
you know we had the idea first baby to

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:35,120
have to have a Cabrini's

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:36,800
service on our call platform so and you

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,420
know me Olson used emojis it was really

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,870
exciting to actually have that built

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,870
into into our container

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,159
Tanner engine it was actually really

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,110
exciting when we first like solving

00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:52,039
emails internally to the belt like you

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:53,210
know fluent D be adopted by by container

00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:55,610
engine because it was kind of a

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,710
validation of group of fluency outside

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,200
of Japan there's an there's a very large

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,880
community but you know it's it's a

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,710
little less well-known or it's a lot

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,799
more well-known now but it wasn't at the

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,380
time very well-known outside of Japan so

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,330
it was very exciting to see that but you

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,029
know eventually like this kind of

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,220
project became you know adopted by a lot

00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:18,590
of other companies Microsoft Red Hat is

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,850
doing open shift and so it needed to

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,700
become a much more community like

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,640
project and so you know with the CNCs

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,960
we've been able to kind of diversify the

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,649
number of people that are committing to

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,220
it so now I think a year ago Google was

00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:36,980
something like 60% of the commits and

00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:39,380
now this year they announced it can

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:42,049
conduct the metrics are something more

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:45,980
like Garba will something like 42

00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:48,169
percent but we actually have a large set

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,940
of like how long do or independent

00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,669
communities so people who are just

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,070
committing to the project as independent

00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:57,260
open-source developers or at small

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,450
companies or things like that and that

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,909
actually makes up 25% of the commits now

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,070
so we have something very similar to the

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,830
number of commits from Google but it's

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,169
actually more commits from independent

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,380
now I think you're like ill numbers

00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:15,159
actually I don't know it's a good

00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,659
question I think that Google will

00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:21,679
continue to be committed and very

00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:25,010
involved in the project but you know I

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,539
think that's having a larger number of

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,700
developers kind of raises everybody's

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,700
praises or you know having a higher

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,990
level water level raises all boats so

00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,760
you know having more developers or

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:39,429
having a lower percentage of Google

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:41,539
commits is probably a good thing but I

00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:44,240
really don't know what the ideal

00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:46,700
percentage might be but you know I'd be

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,809
excited to see more Microsoft mates

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:55,159
actually our kind of interesting to see

00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:56,570
so so I mean you know you know stepping

00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,049
back a little bit like the kind of hobby

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:03,049
of computing so I think Claudia in

00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:05,330
computing itself is not really new to a

00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,700
kind of small subset of properties like

00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,130
google has been running containers you

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,539
know Tina works trading containers

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,840
service they're perfect for probably

00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:16,760
immunity for a decade you know get

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,260
something like almost 15 years it's

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,730
crazy right you know and in previous

00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,610
life I was like Twitter you know they

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,809
were doing it also doesn't it seems you

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,880
know there was kind of like a small

00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,250
subset of companies that have actually

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,929
been using this model of computing for a

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,809
while because if you kind of look at it

00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:35,210
on paper it's really the only like same

00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,010
you know a way of running infrastructure

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,590
at scale and efficient manner

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,330
in my opinion you know the question my

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,580
panelists here kind of opening up to you

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,669
is you know we've seen the success of

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,710
positive computing with a certain subset

00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:52,970
of companies like you know Facebook

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,919
Twitter any Netflix these days you know

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,049
you know one of the missions of CN CF is

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,429
kind of spread cloud computing to the

00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,710
whole world rest of the companies out

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:05,160
there you know why do you think you know

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:07,380
you know this is taking you know a while

00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,030
like what are some of the challenges in

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,760
all these other companies you know on

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,410
board in terms of you know why can't

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,390
they just jump in now in order because

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:20,880
of the roadblocks whole face kind of

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:24,270
great to hear your perspective - sure

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,100
maybe I can go first but I think the

00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,919
thing that I would say is that you know

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,740
with this cycle model there's a lot of

00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:34,710
different organizational tricks that you

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,169
might have to be and so some things like

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,460
you know how do you manage these manage

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,320
the servers how do you actually deploy

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,490
the applications how do you manage the

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,350
kind of life cycle of the application

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,320
like all of this kind of changes a

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,820
little bit and so kind of it takes time

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,549
for people to kind of wrap their heads

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,650
around the whole idea like moving to a

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,720
new model and so I think that that's

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,780
kind of a natural thing that it will

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,620
take time I think that also that it's

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:05,390
very early kind of eyeballed moving the

00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:08,640
cloud native and containers and so

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:10,980
there's there's not quite the present

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,110
like kind of plethora of tools

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,780
there's kind of a lack of truly and so a

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,300
lot of larger companies that have a lot

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,160
of resources and can take advantage of a

00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,830
lot of this and this efficiency in terms

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,780
of point containers and cognitive

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,460
applications you know will do that

00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,040
because they have the resource in that

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,080
they get a lot of benefit uptick right

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,000
now like kind of medium-size and smaller

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,970
sized companies don't get quite how the

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,940
trolling and the ease of use in getting

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,640
into it yet and so I think that that's

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,850
something that will be improving in the

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,310
next few years but I think that that's

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:53,290
one of the main road blocks right now to

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:55,660
adoption actually agree with what you

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,950
said and actually earned quite a lot of

00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,460
customers actually talking about it as

00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,320
well

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,840
like you know what we can't manage or

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,600
when it is Assad says any type of

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,730
betraying your entire employees of this

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,530
new model and then how the processes

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,300
those companies what I've acted sure it

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,390
is like especially them with the DevOps

00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,950
or you know concept very even that we

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,360
have to have an external consultant come

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,730
in and say hey you know if this is your

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,530
organization so resident so the

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,600
technical tolerance is one thing but the

00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:24,850
other thing is the policy change is a

00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,340
very bottom tactical capable and then

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:29,680
also in terms of cloudmom congratu

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,050
bridge sorry to have people open up the

00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,420
cloud it is as well as other nation

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:37,020
because in security concerns and all

00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,340
that but we've started seeing more more

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,870
transformation there I think what about

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,360
through containers because they can

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,420
contain there were two services and I

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,880
think that's the biggest piece k keepa

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,490
mentioned of DevOps in that area

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,780
certainly those technical folks are also

00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:57,190
going to need to be any of the other

00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,080
idea is that one of the reasons why

00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,130
Google is starting to talk about how

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,900
we've done you know essentially DevOps

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,000
and we called what we called it SRA

00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,690
versus I the liable reliability

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,160
engineering and that's one of the reason

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,920
why we're talking about that idea of a

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,520
lot now is because that was kind of

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:22,180
geared toward this quantum Claudia type

00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,080
of environment where you know these type

00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,399
of people were monitoring

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,830
these type of applications and

00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,409
automation totally tooling and things

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,840
like that and so that model works a lot

00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:36,529
better in terms of doing the quote

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,600
unquote DevOps and so you know those

00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:41,269
types of models and getting folks to

00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,820
like kind of learn there was ways of

00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:47,210
doing is that just take a little time I

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,309
think that today's the equation process

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:52,039
is quite hard unless we've waited a

00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:54,559
meeting with a man from Europe and they

00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,059
say we had migrated to be nice so of

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,610
course they need a system of the whole

00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:00,740
areas and they said we have 5,000

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:04,429
production applications so holder to

00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:07,429
meet wait 5,000 each one is different to

00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:12,679
last so it is like changing the paradigm

00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:15,529
how it works systems many many kind of

00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,539
monolithic applications both can be

00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:21,799
deployed in containers or a cloud native

00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:23,779
kind of environments but you know a lot

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:25,730
of times you know applications TV we

00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:28,560
architected there vary depending on the

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,020
type of network we setup

00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,230
that's the one to show valence that open

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,940
floor something that reason eleven

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:39,600
sentinels there is a lot of coleslaw

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,580
runs in production you know back to your

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,980
kind of you know DevOps point it's like

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,150
one of the fascinating things for me at

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,890
least when I was working at their

00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:50,040
Twitter and someone comings like

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:52,230
Google's like the amount of DevOps or

00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,470
sre folks that have you know babysitting

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:58,380
kind of machines is as crazy as usual

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,450
like one you know SRA two and ten to

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,210
twenty thousand machines so if you're a

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,730
sysadmin or kind of a DevOps person I

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,680
would definitely try to learn a little

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,030
bit more about communities and some of

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,040
the orchestration technologies taught

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,050
there because you're gonna have to

00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,850
definitely be classified into skillset

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,470
it's a completely different thing where

00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,980
you know these orchestrators are

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:22,410
actually you know automating some of the

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,420
traditionals is that then skill set out

00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,980
of a job so I've definitely kind of

00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,930
refresh your skills there because it's

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:33,159
amazing companies how fast things will

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:37,389
change so kind of interesting time when

00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:39,489
final question for my panelists here so

00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:43,169
you know we talked a little bit about

00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:46,239
kind of you know how people may migrate

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:48,519
Claudia's a source of nectar Bernays you

00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:51,309
know do you think you know Claudia you

00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,259
know is migrating Claudia people kind of

00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:56,429
like green filled up the patients more

00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:58,539
can your wonderful thing with its mass

00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:00,879
production applications get there in any

00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:02,619
reasonable fashion so dearly bolts in

00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:05,470
terms of like you know is it which one

00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:09,269
which one was potential easier and what

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:17,649
have you kind of seen customers

00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:20,320
declarative well actually I think that

00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:23,529
the alternative stuff is changing a

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,840
although we think about application

00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:29,080
let's get back a little bit if I'm an

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,210
engineer writing an application and my

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,609
focus of the application making database

00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,119
of the resources that I need to to make

00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:37,359
this work

00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:39,820
an X person that is the divorce is a

00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,499
year everybody that is there they need

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,889
to think about how to scale this

00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:47,590
application so thinking about clown

00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:50,080
dating is about how to dig replication

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,789
Otis carrot and application crashes the

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,369
whole time because it's not a big

00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:57,639
surprise but it is how you recover it

00:28:54,369 --> 00:29:00,729
from that a scenario how do you reduce

00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:02,950
your lost profits so what you are going

00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:04,960
to post profits because if you have a

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,769
downtime in production that means you're

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,830
losing money

00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:10,929
so think incriminating when we have more

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,389
diamond from services where you need to

00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:16,200
scale more application requires the

00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:19,539
right knowledge to do half of that in

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,550
for example in I think that other

00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:23,740
companies it goes

00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:26,830
if you have a worker from the local area

00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,230
if I think about Cornelius skilling and

00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,330
then I need to think that I need to log

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,370
like thousands application different

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,470
patterns different notes and their

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:38,980
applications different requirements and

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:42,610
that happens for every developer can

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,180
face up 10 things to a 15 year and every

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,750
a sorry

00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,700
so I think the pattern of cloud native

00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,400
is quite interesting but it's quite

00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,320
challenging and because thickness of

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,970
different companies has opened a

00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,820
technologies like Applegate with

00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,470
communities and most companies say we

00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,710
have known these next five years ago and

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,810
revised why do people bother with but

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,570
right now everything is open ever since

00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,760
as accessible and I think having the

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,680
right amount to deploy application to

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,010
manage application pollution is this air

00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:20,550
anything and you send the CNCs start

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:20,550
activities thanks very much

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,360
application we haven't seen people in to

00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:30,420
transform as a generation it is actually

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,470
it's actually something I'm breaking

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,780
that's pretty much what it is the

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,910
concept there as well but when it comes

00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,250
I see new products or new ideas from

00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,020
very keen on action going into you know

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,790
the cloud native and say and what we

00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,120
like to actually look into that we liked

00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:49,530
actually try this new it always take a

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:55,390
model they got the patient container and

00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:59,290
one kind of orchestrated away in time so

00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:02,110
everything's working exactly the I think

00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:04,120
that you know like it doesn't really

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,150
make sense to like take something and

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:10,150
you know force it into the native world

00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:13,360
if it's working you're not going to get

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:17,440
a large benefit up to like if the costs

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:19,870
don't outweigh it doesn't make sense

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,780
thing but but you know for certain

00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,600
people like you know they're perhaps

00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,670
like running a very inefficient system

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,440
moving it actually does give them a lot

00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,180
of benefit in those cases it makes sense

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,670
to actually you know make the changes

00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:38,380
necessary to do it but for you know for

00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,870
applications that are working well that

00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,540
have you know here are costing too much

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:46,900
and are reasonably efficient than its

00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:49,029
final image of essays and you know both

00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:53,019
you can use both things at the same

00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:55,839
both models actually ease with other

00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:57,609
pieces right people know what that is

00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:02,889
whether this is rather desiccated there

00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:05,709
I think it works before fixing so I

00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:07,569
pretty much wraps up the panel kind of

00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:11,529
concluded with kind of one of thought

00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:14,679
leader is you know as more and more kind

00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:16,509
of companies become you know software

00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,579
companies and you have automotive

00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:20,199
manufacturer is you know you take invent

00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:22,149
anymore software you have the weird

00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:23,739
examples of like John Deere and the farm

00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,419
tractor company started to get the ball

00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:27,819
and Salter known that they're all

00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:30,759
logging due to any monitoring they're

00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:31,929
all going to pact you know I think more

00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:33,459
like some of the internet skill

00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,019
companies like you know Google health

00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:37,029
air in terms of the amount of scale to

00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:39,219
need to manage their infrastructure so

00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:41,139
you know you know my prediction over the

00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:44,139
next you know few years is you'll see

00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:46,929
more and more companies almost you know

00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:48,909
being forced into decision to take

00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:51,759
advantage of cloud native technology

00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:53,319
because you know this path of you know

00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,319
managing all these services that this

00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:58,809
scale kind of has been trotted by some

00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,029
great companies like Google Facebook and

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:03,369
and so on so you'll see more and more

00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:05,099
companies not really adopt cloud native

00:33:03,369 --> 00:33:09,129
technology as they themselves become

00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:11,059
cyber these results so I would thank you

00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:13,460
with everyone for taking

00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:15,409
to us and thank you to you my analyst

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:28,570
with many times you're sure there wasn't

00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:28,570
thank you thanks so much

00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:47,930
okay our final keynote speaker of the

00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:52,470
day is a happy turns liquid character

00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:55,170
and reputation as the film phone have J

00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,360
brother Frankie Foundation and the VP go

00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,730
strategy and he was responsible

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,110
structuring and executing only

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:06,330
operational extra strategic aspect of

00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:08,880
issue as well as reading the user

00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,100
advisory board and industrial official

00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,880
interest group so with that please

00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,880
welcome honey

00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,599
