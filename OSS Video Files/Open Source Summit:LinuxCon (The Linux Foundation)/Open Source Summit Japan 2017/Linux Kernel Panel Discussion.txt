[Music]

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,610
[Music]

00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,890
[Music]

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,400
this would be the last time

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:58,670
and printers or ATM machines and our

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,560
containers and I'm the newest beware to

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,690
confirm the specification and

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,910
intensifying our codes with the

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,730
operating systems will instantly have

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,690
USB support at the time my firm or

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:17,120
cuttlebug image by former shut up

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:19,159
females so fix that up and realize that

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,739
people were contributing I could

00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:26,870
contribute to Linux and the USB stack

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:28,730
and I started doing them this time I

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,480
used to work a lot of art back in the

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:38,930
90s and I did a lot of on the D IX

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:41,000
systems I well I know X was dying and I

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,260
wanted to go to work on this new thing

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,209
that's coming out that's everyone in the

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,940
world is using they call Microsoft

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,950
Windows and I finally got a project

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,530
we're gonna project work on myself at

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,180
all and I got so frustrated with the

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,440
development there because I after

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,430
spending two days defending something I

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,459
thought it was a debugger that was

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,060
broken and I threw my hands on the

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,060
screens

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,879
you know sets of explicit us and said

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,319
can't they make a UNIX for the PC and we

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,970
have this intern sitting next to me in

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:13,609
Iran said they weren't Linux so this is

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,609
1996 so I got all the little just gets

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:18,169
downloaded Slackware and read the places

00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:19,880
I was blown away by the you know the

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,889
copyleft license sounds like this is

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,930
parade this is awesome and I'm like wow

00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:28,789
like actually look at the kernel I mean

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,410
I like that military stuff but I got to

00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:33,430
see like - colonel

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,290
like a UNIX operating system

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,330
I was with my masters and I started

00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,880
looking at doing development my masters

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,699
then I left Lockheed and when this

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,080
company came up called Texas didn't

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,639
real-time development like I gotta get a

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,229
job there I was there doing working when

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:51,070
it's kernels it's also like jump to that

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:52,870
and eventually I went to see the left

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:58,560
hand became self contractor or receive

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,560
Germany and Germany and then Red Hat I

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,600
was in the nineteen department and

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:13,870
somebody there showed me a desktop

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:17,260
rating with Katy and the apartment

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,800
activist was running was playing soccer

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,780
rained in in historic buildings in I

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,740
think I got just applying I'm rich girl

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,880
pageant and at me to my home links girl

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,770
girl that was the greatest thing ever

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,099
could have a parole and that I think

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,099
people

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,400
[Laughter]

00:05:49,200 --> 00:06:02,460
and I decided

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:20,559
someone invaded you no consideration

00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:35,979
became witch-killing

00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:37,899
Skilling's / spirits I'm serious if you

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:40,989
want boredom internal you first of all

00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:42,849
you have to have that the ditch just

00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:45,279
thing to do some people come to me and I

00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:47,919
hate the question about how much Colonel

00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,069
tell me what work no one is how you but

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,169
workers like it's how you want to eat

00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:55,509
you can't do that you have to go and

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:57,729
look at your own find so their interests

00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,659
you because we're not interested in what

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:02,049
you working on

00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:04,929
it's you lose interest on so you need to

00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:06,429
really kind of just you know look if you

00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,909
have your laptop in something's not

00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:09,039
working

00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:11,319
you get curiosity by the way to use path

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,360
traced by the way to look at so you race

00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,769
the function sin actually well with a

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,059
coder this motion graphic a certain look

00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,800
at that well that's how I learned you

00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,749
that's how I learned do parts of the

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,159
kernel all final system calls same

00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:23,919
passage doesn't know what's this thing

00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:26,169
do and I'll just traces like them system

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,610
call all the global gets a code and read

00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,300
the comments and then look there's a

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,889
documentation

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,869
search for the documentation and you can

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,419
learn a whole part of that and that's

00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:36,219
when you say hey this is I can add a new

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:39,080
feature or maybe make something work or

00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:41,960
send a bug patch like everyone

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,580
relate to said hey I saw this code here

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,800
this looks go like a look at it I can

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,510
modify it I may be a Senate but fixed

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:55,840
and that's how you get hooked and it

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:58,340
slowly work your way up humility

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,010
so my first night might you choose small

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,620
bug fixes I wrote a drop like here's the

00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,540
perfect writers was hard work I said I

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,220
swear like five minutes later people

00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,240
like this is wrong this is wrong this is

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:13,130
wrong this help and like this is great

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,530
I learned and you learned from now that

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,110
you learn from your mistakes you make it

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,509
better but it's only playing accepting

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,940
that um your egos involved it's like

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,800
having those Oracle's let's make it

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,389
better together so you learn how to work

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,460
together with other people then there's

00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,500
always somebody else we'll see your

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,899
problems that's that's the key is we

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,640
work together as a community to solve

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,320
each other's problems to that I know

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,110
sometimes won't look good up there that

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,539
we know is there all because of this

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:53,209
idea of going and landing up go from

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:59,110
there let's just give up your ego and

00:08:53,209 --> 00:09:01,790
think it's a courage to just look at how

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:07,480
artists are going to be to modify this

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:07,480
and get yourself in over your head and

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,630
if I need way back up and then it kind

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,899
of goes back to what records think of is

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,820
that you can't have spent a year in your

00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,260
school or in your work you can't have

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
all the smart people in the world in the

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,800
same room but when your noble source

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,020
project to get to work with with all the

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,680
bright lines across the planet that's

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,800
what really got me was the back going I

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,710
can struggle him then the smart people

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,300
can help me out

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,920
that's why it's named open source is

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,210
being able to workers will this work I

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
want to have a little thing it's like

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,780
one thing you want to do this thing if

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,460
it were play with the kernel break it

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,130
down unfortunate machines

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,840
you don't worry about breaking hardware

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:51,490
by the employers machine change the

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:56,390
kernel and Steve will brace learn

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:57,980
anything actually know how people aren't

00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,990
the car let's see it's like it's just

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,580
awkward and some people think that the

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,320
hacking the kernel is is something

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,730
magical but it's the exact same than the

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,050
other parents we write code for other

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,180
people to read it first

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,070
we think it's very obvious and I want

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:17,900
you to fix my clothes and I'm with all

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:21,290
the innocent Ricky generally it's very

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,960
simple very easy code the parts of the

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,550
hard work there's some great comments

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,740
that get some of the graphics properties

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,160
like do this do it again do the end

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:35,620
please I hope it's can work is so hard

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,620
work is crazy but it's very simple

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,580
[Laughter]

00:10:47,329 --> 00:11:12,110
I don't know about others and you can

00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:16,660
look at it if you ask nicely done we

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,759
have over 103 250 people per animals

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:31,489
over I think about 100 others are ready

00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:33,199
every so but you never know who's gonna

00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:35,540
do that one patch and they get both of

00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:37,429
you more so the great place to start is

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,519
I point out the staging for the cattle

00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:43,339
trade driver stated cuz it's attached

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,040
then fix that the comments are changes

00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:47,959
proper grammar or changing the coding

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,540
style and then teaches you how to get

00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,089
past II said their email clients and a

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,769
passion get a response get it through

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,360
and it takes a little while to just

00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,559
learn that basic process and after you

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,470
do that anymore

00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,509
that's a great place to be a maintainer

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,950
is impulsive systems and the kernels are

00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:09,700
not staged so it's a very good thing

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,260
why that's there so I strongly recommend

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,770
that yeah the little criminal challenge

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,770
is a good thing

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,090
well actually it's funny because

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,290
sometimes it's up to us to help make

00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,140
things go like right now we're each

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,850
going to hire to being nervous to help

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,920
people inside the company to come

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,750
horrible the source friendly and one

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,640
things that we have to do is work with

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,220
people at this club it's not like those

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,570
warm dry patches or companies where kind

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,190
of blocks that have actually three about

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,900
it we're trying to break the people from

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,460
that and say no if you play start

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,430
committing to a label for the project

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,390
stop and don't become part of the view

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,370
and you try to get a little more

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,080
involved and we're trying to work over

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,790
the other management to say they'll give

00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,800
the engineers more time to actually

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,450
spend because it takes time so those

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,850
work with this so we're trying to get

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,950
the time for that I have a project I'm

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,600
trying to work on that to create a good

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,130
open source project to public at the end

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,230
were thing and actually I was in the

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,390
university by universities to buy and

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:11,260
they talked to my professors and I said

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:13,300
can you give me some students actually

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,220
he said you got an HD sticker who I'm

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,380
trying to get to work with me to try to

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,790
also build up a community to get new

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,190
people not me and we're people but does

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,310
anyone to come in work on this project

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,520
it's a faction project and trying it for

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,520
me

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,900
[Music]

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:34,320
and there's also internal dollars tools

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,330
self-test directories please go to a

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,020
self test directory or trying to add a

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,790
lot of small unit tests before holsters

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,100
to my work in that race I have a whole

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,920
test suite outside of Linux that no one

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,170
else uses I'm slowly trying to get that

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,520
in top it takes time because my test

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,920
suite is usually I kind of like

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,500
everybody quick act to simulate that

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,120
book and then I just activate regression

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,120
test but it's

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,749
[Music]

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,839
yesterday transferring everything over

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:09,990
it's just I have whatever left on that

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,990
access to and I know sir

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,519
what it does basically you have to send

00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,380
away all I need is an athlete an

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,180
external machine or a virtual machine or

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,370
real hardware you have to be able to

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,140
read it through standard input and they

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,510
will reboot the machine remotely and

00:16:54,140 --> 00:17:00,140
then you do this little boot of the

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,910
Machine it will skim the blue box to see

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,500
everything there's no crashes or

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,600
anything and then if you say from this

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,880
test they'll actually ill install the

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,740
new kernel it will send something to the

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,120
machine and they will run it for you and

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,620
you can run several tests today that's

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,040
what I usually do for money before I

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,470
said anything

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:26,720
elitist I have a 13 hour test suite that

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:29,809
comes to patients I have done my testing

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:39,770
is a right code experts all right good

00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:41,690
events and Facebook oh let it go let's

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,410
see if it'll actually whatever the

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:56,990
technical I just wrote it

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:56,990
I wanted to eat

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,089

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,220

basement that builds all the stable

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,930
kernels boots them different

00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:59,030
configurations of community you see

00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:02,840
there were about 150 different

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:06,410
architectures reserved a colonel and

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,750
colonel see on girls actually are really

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,780
good

[Music]

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:52,470
it's a boring Russian exhaust just do

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:52,470
the fun part we're awesome tomorrow

00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:07,630
it'll run like you almost thing we're

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:11,320
doing that was trying to get braavos

00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:16,780
developers or with what we need to do to

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:19,990
device persistent memory discussion

00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,429
about process of the need you to call

00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,500
have seemed to tell you that the ranks

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:25,150
are done and there's been that way

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,950
forever but that's a little bit too slow

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,720
for this new world where persistent

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:42,100
memory is also working through the ball

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:44,920
storage spikes be right india city you

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,260
must see us even though we leave agency

00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,480
can upload and I'm constantly since

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,610
entering that I have a CD touch press

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,610
that or a stress test that basically

00:22:51,610 --> 00:23:00,460
just set up a way of did a binary

00:22:53,610 --> 00:23:02,050
account so that's it disabled CPU sent

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,260
me so what we'll do is shut down Steve's

00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,260
hero

00:23:32,450 --> 00:24:10,620
there's the giant servers or they throw

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,789
whole drawers amuse in and out then many

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,789
people the sudden empowerment

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,299
in there

00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,400
[Music]

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:42,240
a lot of things but it's still renewed

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,250
to keep up with all the bugs that are

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,690
being fixed so I have to keep up with

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,910
that hustle I'm doing well wanna be and

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,690
if I wait two weeks a night that rain

00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:53,030
just slow down

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:53,030
it's a bigger one I do release with two

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,300
vanilla kernels sometimes yeah it's

00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,010
topping the morel submerging them into

00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,200
the Android if you look watched if you

00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,730
have a great places I'm automatically

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,220
merging them into the into a common

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,170
trees analysis Democrats South part that

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,750
really sports that's in testing to to

00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,910
get out to associate members that's a

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,950
lot of work to do they go around talking

00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:23,810
Elias and see vendors were cool to try

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,810
to fix there are little Android

00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:29,330
and that's changing a lot releases of

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,250
their doing so it's just going through

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,550
their nests against it it does reduce my

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,290
time - you question code all I do is the

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,970
maintainer and Dave Miller said that's

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,610
really well all years ago as the

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,170
maintainer you're my competitor they ran

00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,970
out of people's stuff the amount of

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,680
criticism everything small and because

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,120
he used to be a developer or a writer

00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,220
that you had a little project on your

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,840
side but you don't write new code if you

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,820
look at the maintainer of subsystems

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,520
were people that read other people's

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,580
stuff and we all performance direction

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,350
we're not writing it's very rarely I

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,720
have a little tiny map seven things I'm

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,980
working on my plate wrinkled mallet and

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,560
now picking up one of the internal

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:24,050
hardening options I do one about one new

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:26,000
kernel nature so I tell people you don't

00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,260
you said yeah - and I don't respond to

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,490
you in a week does me I'm ignoring you

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,900
just say it kind of got lost

00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,760
just a second thing I had you won't

00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,440
defend me if you said hey did you forget

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,380
about me I'll say yes I did thank you

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,809
for reminding me so

00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,150
you don't get a response a week or two

00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:41,570
since we said that we do not feel bad

00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,419
about it

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,830
do not feel bad about the treatment plan

00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:47,510
and then by the way you're really a

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,460
psycho because I do is I try to do the

00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,410
colonel real time stable releases every

00:28:49,460 --> 00:29:07,039
other week and every time I do that

00:28:51,410 --> 00:29:09,620
I'm like all the hardware and trying to

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,380
hit other teens to test is that I can

00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,380
quote my latest able kernels and they

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,780
also said and not having to track the

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,780
substrate

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,090
Oh

00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:13,470
I think you're in a great work I want to

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:16,559
ask why has that every form of a good

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,850
times people always see buttocks to an

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,840
extent they talk about the UNIX works

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,510
okay

00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,130
the difference really is closed source

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,630
proprietary software before has been

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,730
open source

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,910
you know she's community software works

00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,590
so good what happens is in a proprietary

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,210
environment in for the girl someone

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,730
else's has changes we've changes you

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,230
never need to reverse back I have well

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,900
you as a customer you have to look at

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,190
the original which one you want you say

00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,350
ok this is the most features I want

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,210
there's there those share features in

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,530
Soviet to pick which is emotional speech

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,030
it's going to use the big that product

00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,010
that they have locked in and everything

00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:53,100
its workforce will destroy that's all

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,780
units tonight with menaces to society

00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,160
you can work we had words you know

00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,870
there's a go back and the concept is

00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,590
important out there fo Baba can see

00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,450
there's a disagreement

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,190
you know form onto this thing and what

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,139
happens is when there's a feature that

00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,850
becomes really good at you say that

00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:08,620
there's a fork coming in to you is just

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,049
decide which one's better and one that

00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,980
gets the most well then when the

00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,019
merchants went back the other guys like

00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,490
I'm losing and losing customers because

00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:16,179
I don't have a speech at the other side

00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,460
the forecast

00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,710
so I'll version it so people are content

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:27,909
developers back so it's just it keeps

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:29,909
moving release here because do the

00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:32,259
developments that I really some products

00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:33,909
hopefully I can get this passes back in

00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:35,769
so I can do another product and not have

00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:37,330
to forward horde everything if you look

00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:39,369
at a lot of SOC menders they show up for

00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,769
work and they have to start over they

00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:42,299
had their three minute last codes and

00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:44,919
off they go

00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:47,230
that's so therefore you know what those

00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,889
are all Forks off the main branch but

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,059
like we left because I have a works on

00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:53,799
health another careful but different

00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:57,039
subsystems we maintain and then we merge

00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:00,669
that but it's orcs are good clean

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,960
treaties just great and then they slowly

00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:06,100
pulling stuff in there because they have

00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,600
worked with over a decade yeah the forks

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,999
Kanna forces us does that take me to

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,039
keep to keep us to grow things in it

00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,899
there are a bunch of the new features

00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,789
enabling optimizations that are all he

00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:17,740
beheaded and there's no and there's no

00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:20,499
cold people that have work to come back

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,679
in and get their kind of screen so the

00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:25,690
pace is this is this rocket ship of an

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,960
answer that's my lovable old all the

00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:31,170
forks back individual enter commanders

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,000
or

00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:35,290
where's Lamar says but those shoes they

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,470
didn't see everybody changes went up

00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:43,540
again we're going master again overnight

00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:45,010
messes up an hour I said that it were

00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,080
you it's crazy it's here and you have

00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,060
it's going nuts

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:54,010
that's nice we got the process has

00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:57,210
really been perfect we're doing we have

00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,210
more developers every year

00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,299
I shall head onto the fork thing they

00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:10,179
said their sakes okay it's all good

00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:13,179
right now no if you're familiar with my

00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:14,499
girl matching I knew about the black

00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:16,119
girl patching this without their

00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:19,509
development for a year I had those of

00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:22,479
Kay Thatcher and there's their wage was

00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:24,729
already before they announced 10 and

00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:27,249
then there's another month before my

00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:28,869
toxic well then the Suzy can all had

00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:30,820
sent a draft and they were way behind

00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:36,129
the developments baby cousin Nelson

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:37,509
quicker before they vetted and though

00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:39,039
the sort of read heavily didn't get it

00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:41,559
because remember our clunky with the

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,909
manager of cape action when the

00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:45,460
announcement came so we got announced

00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:48,070
ours house so people don't think that

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,379
were copy whatever but they said you

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:54,789
know I hope I said I'm friends I saw

00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:57,340
who's managing easy casino I was a

00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,690
manager not principal and she was saying

00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:02,409
did you go talk with them and we'll work

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:03,879
together so we have one solution or not

00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:05,379
I have the right solution exclusive

00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:09,669
solution we have one solution inside

00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:12,369
colonel it's a little office so and when

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:13,899
the company gets it your competitors so

00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:15,429
Suzy hands might have a big time and

00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:19,440
everybody working together with your

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,440
