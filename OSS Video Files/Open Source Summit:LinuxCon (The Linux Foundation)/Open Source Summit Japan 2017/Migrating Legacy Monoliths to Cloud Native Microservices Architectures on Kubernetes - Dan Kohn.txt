Description: 
	Cloud Native architectures, such as those built on Kubernetes, are envied for their ability to segment different parts of an application into microservices that can separately be containerized, so that each microservice can be written in its own language, with its own framework, and its unique set of libraries. This has been shown to significantly increase developer and team productivity by decoupling dependencies between different parts of a team. However, most legacy code consists of a large monolithic code base, not microservices applications. This talk will look at several real-world cases where existing monolithic, legacy applications deployed in multi-billion dollar companies were slowly evolved into cloud native microservices architectures on Kubernetes. Demonstrating that the cloud native architecture is suitable across most categories of computing.
