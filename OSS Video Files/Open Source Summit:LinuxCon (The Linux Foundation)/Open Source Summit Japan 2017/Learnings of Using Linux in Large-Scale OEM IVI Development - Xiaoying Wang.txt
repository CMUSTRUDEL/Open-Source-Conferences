all right next speaker is jogging Wang

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,140
the chief operating officer at Sun tech

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,630
today will be speaking on the learnings

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:42,379
of using Linux in large-scale volumes

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,379
Mei development please welcome mr. ray

00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:51,859
[Music]

00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:37,550
hello everyone and explore in addition

00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:37,550
to the practice to that image

00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:53,190
so July position I will just have a

00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:58,600
brief interest of myself and they appeal

00:01:53,190 --> 00:02:02,440
so we know our contacts and I joined

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:08,200
some times in that message an email

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:12,900
whole career example I would want to the

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:17,770
Heisenberg madman and the both recently

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:22,920
at my bar last kill you

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,920
I joined battement Oh

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:29,880
Irish circumventing of project

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:46,030
and speaking of large college and become

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:52,090
an adult Americans covered the most

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:59,739
cultures in the world and we map out in

00:02:52,090 --> 00:03:08,200
color the map and hope of being our you

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:12,480
know the meaning of use and their own

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:17,500
space according to the NASA higher

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:23,560
principle around four hundred thousand

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:29,129
times and under the way around ten

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,129
million times but it's in development

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:44,970
connecting middle stage innovation and

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:49,799
multiplication so whether this kind of

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:55,150
projects in a teeny little challenge

00:03:49,799 --> 00:04:01,379
getting a little here from my page I

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,379
will respond by one as sheer power

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:16,729
but really important to for peace like a

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:22,509
great promoter great and healthy and the

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:27,949
trees but the next generation of healthy

00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:33,889
it will be City for people because you

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:38,169
the revised the baseline spray and more

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:44,479
higher health regime and much

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:52,849
connectivity so always require more

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:59,090
little memory and - woman oh I'll be

00:04:52,849 --> 00:05:10,310
sure to not end so we can be used our

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:15,800
software in the for a the bottom right

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:20,090
of the used of mechanisms are called

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:24,760
from energy and human time yes and we

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:31,159
need a call again reduce costs and

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:35,870
reduce to seventh grade but code written

00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:39,710
in that time they are always outdated

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:44,449
technologies and is measuring the one

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:46,599
from Nigeria time so many observers must

00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:51,469
halt completion

00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:55,789
involve the operation this kind of

00:05:51,469 --> 00:06:01,789
trouble in their heart to committed

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:07,629
people beat so without the project every

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:12,979
right to use the a string open source

00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:19,159
especially for anonymity part we are

00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:24,949
using open sources of because all of the

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:32,119
job is it going to use involved currency

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:39,199
parks will nice Oh God Christopher would

00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:49,149
be very much easier to to track student

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:53,869
importance and scale it up and

00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:58,929
cooperation among teeth so you can see

00:06:53,869 --> 00:07:03,099
in internal Obama native green in our

00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:13,069
simplified version is you making cute

00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:19,879
and most of modules an income so have

00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:26,149
without an engineer or entitled the

00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:30,639
cooperation among our genes and pride of

00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:38,119
an important because is that kind of the

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:44,079
projector everyone taking a pen child in

00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:44,079
and no one won't be still I am

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:58,190
the white friend is platform we decide

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:58,190
to use AGL in determining from home and

00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:12,330
we design our own paradise federal

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:18,570
departments so we create HD came he came

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:24,870
and he came to that the majority earlier

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:29,340
conserve air compact integral and we in

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:33,260
event application will walk became

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:39,380
manager of Max and common application

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:42,710
the amendment of application and we

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:48,210
independence and the premiere of

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:52,770
application account are tractable so the

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:56,130
email application community doubled from

00:08:52,770 --> 00:09:06,980
this application store even out the

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:13,530
ocean Monica so for intensifying cases

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:20,960
when you a fashion we need to go on this

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:28,200
voyage is nine years of the NGO internet

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:32,120
because then they die so we create Frank

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:39,230
our hero use our own action

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:43,180
I encourage this and while the Mastiff

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:49,990
and reduced interest rate prevent

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:54,170
ecology and reading promotion problem

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:59,769
and walk in peril which can take

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:02,110
advantage of the poor where I hope in

00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:07,069
the next 10 days

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:14,899
the locust event for analysis and also

00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:19,730
the first an in - Kitty a winner the

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:24,920
unreleased protection problem will not

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:27,220
advance yes I think the interim asked

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,220
you

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:44,700
and help you we know that most I'm doing

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:52,670
activities in Damascus integrating the

00:10:44,700 --> 00:11:00,560
rich so multiple tickets putting on GI

00:10:52,670 --> 00:11:06,690
violence and camera one intense and

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:12,180
create relief so we have 100 completely

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:16,500
thermal we can send a thought to the you

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:30,720
attacked and the second is in every

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:34,650
comment and the either detect and so we

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:39,870
also provide functional tests the

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:46,370
friends over tonight from and cold we

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:51,690
can do cutie everything all right ample

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:56,900
we great a large database of calculation

00:11:51,690 --> 00:12:02,100
so yes or the most super nodes

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:07,460
integrated they will accuser and call

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:14,250
Emily compared to the robot renovating

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:17,180
so in that way the develop can moguls to

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,180
will find their power

00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:32,920
so the previous play is pretty nice for

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:35,860
an uncommon team part of a Lexington and

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:41,309
the materiality learning can be a very

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:47,680
good reference to that diet inform and

00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:54,910
involve the ironwork can combine that

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:59,529
self-efficacy energy and thank you and

00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:14,949
we have a new TV which is a unarmed

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:16,269
people thank you all right thank you

00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:21,579
very much

00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:24,670
Kaneda angel isn't nothing live it in CI

00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:28,439
and healthy in the coming year it's a

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:33,399
big part of our efforts so that Xena

00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:36,689
our next speaker are a figure is a king

ability the dr. day will be held at

00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,920
source hardware model with modularity

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,439
trying the collaborative innovation in

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,769
the automotive industry and reduced and

00:13:50,439 --> 00:13:56,129
the time the markets are people come

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,129
king

00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,360

you will be late are we together and how

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:30,660
is the car of the future and she was

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:35,190
about me and the founder and CEO of

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,850
avoid Negro which is a data from Silicon

Valley

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,270
thanks I find Combinator and you ever

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:46,530
heard of I come here three greater and

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:49,080
okay a few they'd agree if I he is the

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:52,170
most powerful acceleration program for

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:58,430
our approval they help small companies

00:14:52,170 --> 00:15:04,470
like a movie theater finished on also

00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:08,670
trembles for example something become

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:13,650
very successful and which of our

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:17,310
companies and also the health driving

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:20,430
company right through the donation and

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:23,910
you heard ok they've been fired by

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:31,250
General Motors and rule painful horrible

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:35,130
million dollars in at the time

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:39,000
absolutely take another nine I try to

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:41,430
quit my job I was working as we even it

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,520
does look like I am

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:49,650
originally and my variable kukuri which

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,280
is Detroit emoji okay

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:56,400
and you have like 40 years of experience

00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:02,570
in transportation I have stand in a

00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:06,900
traditional land or yield imagery and

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:09,330
back at the time in 2009 I decided with

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:14,340
my job is going to be to channel if you

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:17,450
haven't heard of to be number one is I

00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:20,090
am doing company in the world say things

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,790
the latest double meanings for example

00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:27,950
okay also the Back to the Future car

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:30,690
like Lauren but I was there very very

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:34,430
soft all the traditional industry

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,110
because there's no real information okay

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,390
so I decided to move to Silicon Valley

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,740
because I was saving track of what's

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:46,430
happening there like all these small

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,620
companies becoming super being and

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:52,740
scalable by Google train Twitter

00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:56,100
and I still have India that the world

00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:00,810
from miracle tonic organizations of the

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:05,940
target repeating will merge with the

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:09,839
traditional audience at the time my

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:14,540
belief I have also my castle and oil
