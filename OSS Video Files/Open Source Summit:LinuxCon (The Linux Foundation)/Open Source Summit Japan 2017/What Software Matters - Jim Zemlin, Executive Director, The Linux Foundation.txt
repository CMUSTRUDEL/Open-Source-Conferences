	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,950
today we have a very special

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,620
announcement about a big breakthrough in

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,620
our automotive Linux platform I won't

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,990
spoil it but just if you go over there

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,049
around noon you'll hear about some great

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,600
news about HCl and it's not just in the

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,779
automotive sector in cloud computing we

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,510
have cloud foundry project we have the

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:28,260
positive computing initiative which is

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,220
led by the kubernetes project were homes

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,949
nodejs

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,100
which is the largest server-side

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,730
javascript platform in the world on

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:42,660
english like 15,000 15 million dollars a

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,579
month on ojs were alone with the world

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,980
largest certificate authority

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,820
laughing critics which provides create

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,800
certificates for anyone on the Internet

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,800
in order to make the internet more

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,350
secure we are home to some of the

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,780
world's largest software fine networking

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,449
projects projects like the open Network

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,850
automation platform which is being used

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,210
orchestrate of the production

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,390
infrastructure of Louisville over 40% of

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,040
the world's mobile subscriber base just

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,750
an amazing project so really you can see

00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,720
that the lay foundation has expanded

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,770
beyond Linux and more importantly open

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,860
source in general has become a very very

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:33,720
important part of how technology is

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:37,340
created and the canoe is everyday

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,970
there's more and more focus source

00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:44,340
available for everyone to consume I

00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:48,619
think it's just amazing to think about

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:54,000
the fact that just up get up there are

00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:57,240
64 million open source repositories

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,140
or billion just think about that 21

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,740
million developers are working on 64

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,930
million projects on any keeps growing

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,550
every day you have to Software

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,040
Foundation is home to hundreds of

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,340
projects the Eclipse Foundation hundreds

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,190
as well there are just so many

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,730
open-source projects out there it is

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,130
hard to even believe but the key

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,070
question that I think we all should

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,709
think about at this event is not how

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,880
much open-source software is out there

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:36,270
but the real question is what open

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,020
source projects really not what open

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:42,600
source projects are really important

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:46,200
according to industry important to

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:50,240
society for government and important in

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:54,209
all of us and they'll only look at that

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,250
Foundation what we find is that projects

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,560
that have lots and lots of values that

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,920
are widely deployed and mission critical

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,860
infrastructure there are nine out of

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,670
those over 64 million it's a very very

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,480
small percentage and so what we started

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:16,370
asking ourselves at the foundation is

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:19,470
what are the characteristics of those

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:22,560
really most important open-source

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:26,280
projects what is it about them that

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,790
makes them different than the other 63

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,959
million projects that are out there

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:37,110
and the answer is open airy projects

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,170
with sustainable ecosystems are the

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,860
projects that become most important to

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:47,430
industry and society and so think of it

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,170
as it is a very simple formula the most

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,769
important open-source projects out there

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:57,110
are projects that start with B be good

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:59,540
code that solves really poorly

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:02,630
problems in the case of automotive-grade

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,420
linux the problem they're solving is how

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,480
do you create an automotive software

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,660
experience the heads-up display the

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,030
instrument cluster the enviable amnesia

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,239
an entertainment system how do you

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,910
create that for production vehicles that

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:23,950
will be around foreclosures behave those

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:26,630
Cloud Foundry how we create a global

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:30,680
developer platform that can enable

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,650
digital transformation for thousands and

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,740
thousands of companies around so you

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:40,310
start a great mode in a project that's

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,620
also big problems and then organizations

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:48,020
whether it's companies or governments

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:51,160
use that code to create a value in the

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,680
form of profit or in the case of

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:59,240
government values in the moment maybe

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:02,510
more transparency maybe cost savings put

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,669
value nonetheless and then that value is

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:11,390
in turn reinvested reinvested back into

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:14,960
the project which gets more codes which

00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:18,350
is or value product and services paid on

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,960
that code which begets more reinvestment

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:26,990
and you see that creates a long term

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:31,360
stainable open-source project it looks

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:35,030
like this where projects become products

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:40,700
create profit that is then reinvested

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:43,520
back into the project itself and one of

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,350
the other characteristics that we see in

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,040
the most important movement sorry

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:52,090
in the world is that they need to be in

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:56,240
a place they need a set of

00:05:52,090 --> 00:06:00,050
infrastructure that enables thousands of

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,280
developers hundreds of companies to come

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,110
together and co-created software in a

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,910
place where they can trust each other

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,480
and that's really what foundations

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:13,460
enable Foundation enable projects to

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:17,030
create big communities to solve our

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:20,000
problems enable organizations to trust

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,560
that code to trust that event is a place

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,560
they can create products that great

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,750
provocations this is the fundamental

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,670
idea of what God agents like Linux

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:33,700
Foundation or many other open-source

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:37,700
foundations and creating sustainability

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:41,270
requires real-world work that we focus

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:45,340
on vision are hard at work at every

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:49,640
single day you need an organization that

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:52,160
can hold the assets of the development

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,350
process of the trademark don't manage

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,260
the copyright travel is manage the

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,440
development process the development

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,930
process itself a way for developers and

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,900
organizations to make technical to see

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,850
you need infrastructure to be able to

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,730
co-create whether it's testing

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,850
infrastructure the own the structure you

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,670
need this new code you need to be able

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,980
to grow into this system you know it

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,860
turns out and moving source are many

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,320
matters you needle maybe promote your

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,990
project to get more developers and more

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,630
organizations working on it to creating

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,710
projects products based on that project

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,870
in order to get

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,090
if I need legal manager because

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,970
essentially software creation is the

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:43,450
sharing of intellectual property and you

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,640
need a safe and orderly way to manage

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,280
that and letting the property in a trust

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,200
environment whether it's managing the

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,570
copyright whether its licensing

00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,970
trademark exchange or some sort of

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,880
compliance program or so forth you need

00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:02,080
all these things in order to really

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:05,710
achieve large-scale Japan as an

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,650
open-source project and that's really

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,950
what the leaves on dating is and so the

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:14,710
final question I think about what really

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,080
makes important open-source projects is

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,050
to sort of think about what the future

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,620
of open source looks like and put it in

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:27,250
that context and you know when I look

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,890
forward Ponder's your mound ten years

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,700
from now the question is not only

00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:39,790
brought in so many projects now but will

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:41,620
open source matter in tenders or maybe

00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,910
we'll go back to the tribe yourself or

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,490
maybe everything will shift to

00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,770
individual and what we see a quick

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,650
foundation is that both a source is

00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,300
really becoming a permanent part of

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,240
modern technology development modern

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,590
software and it's making use of three

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,410
big mega terms and those trends were

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,800
first identified by Tim O'Reilly a few

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,740
years ago but it really come together

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,630
just in the last few years and those

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,230
three controls are first the

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:15,310
commoditization of IT and software

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,560
TechCrunch

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,470
a good example of this is in the network

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,200
acceptor where things that were

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:26,380
previously sold as hardware appliances

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,500
networking are now being such an create

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,020
an attractive software and delivered as

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,720
vertical networking solution and

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,200
function virtualization software line

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,030
networking and that software is being

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,930
delivered on commodity like box hardware

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:47,260
training cases

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:50,010
so that's modernization is creating

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,170
tremendous change in the IT sector and

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,270
remember that change creates big

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,130
opportunities

00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:00,970
the second big mega trend that we're

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:05,020
seeing condition to quantization of IT

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:06,850
is mass collaboration and with analytics

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,590
on vision of at the center of this and

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,980
so we understand this very very cloud

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:15,100
not only as the industry and society

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:18,760
realized that open source development a

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,780
faster better cheaper way to deliver

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:26,070
software but what we did not expect is

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,590
that software developers themselves

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:34,330
would be incredibly motivated to use

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:37,600
this form of development that for many

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:41,730
software developers open-source is more

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,820
than just a job developing open source

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:49,870
something that they love to do in order

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:53,410
to solve a problems in order to increase

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:56,860
their reputation amongst their peers and

00:10:53,410 --> 00:11:00,420
in order to just simply have fun in the

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,370
act of solving hard problems together

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,650
this was something that wasn't really

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,320
apparent in the early digital sources

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,720
and now many many years

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,900
later this is something that is creating

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,270
a further faster tranche in terms of how

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,150
software is developed because you have

00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,970
incredibly motivated software developers

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,740
in these resources so the

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,590
commoditization combined and

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,960
collaboration are really important but

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:30,300
the third important mega trend is making

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,060
open source the standard way of building

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,420
software this really happened with cloud

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,030
computing or software as a service and

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,320
this is incredibly important in the very

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:46,110
nature of the technology industry

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,380
shifting from a product and you or you

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,730
sell hardware or Plankton's a piece of

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,890
software to a service industry or

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,220
software and hardware are just part of

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:04,320
the big insurance are the cost of

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:09,000
delivering issues whether it's on Amazon

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,980
we go I saw sloughed what really

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,130
happened here is that software has

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:17,400
medium profit side from becoming untrue

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:21,320
to your cost side of the accounting

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:24,960
ledger and when you move a profit cost

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,710
the software that is free is going to

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,170
win every single time and those are the

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,900
big trends that that matter here it's

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,300
this combination combination

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:39,290
collaboration and cloud that really made

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,630
open-source defining wages

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:45,240
software and that is only accelerating

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,380
as we move faster in vast majorities

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,120
transform the next five years

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,430
so open source is definitely here to

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,400
stay because important for all you

00:12:53,430 --> 00:13:00,900
understand that and into open source the

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,270
projects that have the most value to

00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,580
your company your industry to your

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:09,180
career are those that have sustained

00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:12,150
resistance this week we are going to see

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,580
dozens and dozens or open summary

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:17,190
projects that fit that description and I

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,150
hope you will take the opportunity to

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:23,040
talk core developers for reading this to

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:25,740
speak with leaders for helping to manage

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,680
these projects they're all here in Japan

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:43,230
and we're very excited to be here with

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:45,660
all of you thank you very much the

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,870
keynote vision movie now an admission of

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,900
beta computing we will be discussing

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:56,630
about how projects like kubernetes plan

00:13:51,900 --> 00:14:00,740
of addressing and liquidity shapes of

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:04,260
shaping our modern infrastructure the

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:07,830
moderator of this issue is pretty

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:12,060
maintenance T of all from a computing

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:15,190
condition repo boundary and

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,190
[Music]

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,549
[Music]

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:51,700
oh very beginning and so on my name is

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:53,050
Tricia havoc few ohia foundation at the

00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,660
beginning involved in founding site de

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,980
Bergerac i've been with me since

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:03,430
inception on today's panel is all around

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:06,640
kind of needed technology with out of

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:09,220
each kind of voices from different

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:15,030
projects and earlier so first off to my

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,030
left we have an echo from microsoft's

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:26,770
you would google adword Accola from

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:28,090
chair Anita and contractor so kind of

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:36,520
kick things off wish I had a little

00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:40,780
truth so on April 23 of PSO gif is

00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:43,960
formed in December 2015 and when we

00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:48,040
first of England things off and kind of

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:51,190
is in the background of history that so

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,910
a lot of people are aware that the open

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,700
source community orchestrated technology

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,480
and the time they approached the legs

00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,180
foundation help kind of build a home in

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,880
total per turbine innings and you know

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,740
the initial discussions were well you

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,110
know do we and we just want to kind of

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,730
build a current any foundation or to

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,470
kind of build and you know you know

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,350
build something more than just that so

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,090
originally

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,300
you know excited to focus on the whole

00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:23,340
notion of cognitive computing which

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,670
which essentially all of you including

00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:28,500
me that you have services microservices

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,420
we're gonna call that running containers

00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,860
that are orchestrated by some central

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,920
concepts that's all

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,770
Claudia Vinci means orchestration just

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,160
listed at that and so they're forming TF

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,440
we realized that yes communities kind of

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,620
conduct and and one of our most

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,010
important projects but the older Slough

00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:53,190
technologies around monitoring tracing

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:55,340
logging and so on metal kind of coming

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,510
to the foundation kinda get the whole

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,720
confident body in the kitchen so that's

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,780
kind of where we are today just a couple

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,420
weeks ago we announced our 10 project to

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,150
join need foundation whole container

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,370
network interface of C nines for shorts

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,500
and so we've kind of grown an already

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,500
