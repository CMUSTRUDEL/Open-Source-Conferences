baggage home since 2000-2001 so it is

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,340
about 16 years long but this is the

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:08,850
first time for me to representations

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:13,460
gonna chill Freeman possible others

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,350
explain all the sudden beacon business

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,229
some of you might think of is like a

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,229
lighting company and the south in Ottawa

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:27,659
takes of satis of Home Affairs company

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:31,259
but statue is no podía any command

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:37,140
magoseong social infrastructure provider

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:41,670
company made target area Heda divided in

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:45,000
the covariance some charger power the

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,740
second when the industry this

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,450
usually water some point of ours another

00:01:48,740 --> 00:02:00,030
small city last one is a financial

00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:03,690
health care to provide a solution to

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:09,060
these in a segment our studies the

00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:12,320
broker I will compel form then ma ma

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,980
examination of all the negative data on

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:23,220
this that wonderful traffic my the

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:26,730
signal platform or my social one only

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:32,780
one temple can be providing to these

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:36,930
four areas to have I hidden why the hope

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:41,910
we leave us up opens of us to implement

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:46,170
Omar kitchen people go to their album we

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:58,400
have a local partner cicada is a company

00:02:46,170 --> 00:03:02,280
I think um in Congress so they can focus

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:07,160
on think up there are communities were

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,160
there all software to walk in

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,840
come home and of course such as a

00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:17,640
preference must be verified by the CEO

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,019
especially an automotive or

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:29,910
transportation system mascot here are

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:32,690
both integers so winners of all open so

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:39,530
they are with instructors because

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:42,950
important point either as in Chapel

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:47,989
without a solution without any help from

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:51,030
partners autumn winds up Tosca has

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,920
another vendor such as the constructor

00:03:51,030 --> 00:04:01,610
of transportation control furniture

00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:05,819
Kakaako trifid to smoothly integrally is

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:10,349
important so we supporters often stand

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:13,889
on an open protocol and Sun contains a

00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:17,280
dubbing development country s is very

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:23,359
speedy suitable we need to give us a

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,359
solution to rank time customer requests

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,750
so want to support these points we use

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,310
solution focus also trim some of

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:39,060
opposite

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:43,130
artery are some other open source of the

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:48,450
solar system there are sound science

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:51,599
internal for example drag a video window

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,180
support on system of water ready for

00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:57,599
work seven days a week and secondly the

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:01,550
vogner safety system must be a safety

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:03,600
one decibel they must comply with

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:10,200
international

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:13,590
just under the social security officials

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,030
if a surgeon was a busybody does long

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,770
time saga

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:24,600
10 to 20 years important that's why the

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:32,420
compliance are we must follow the

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,420
license rules well digger's ligatures I

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:42,650
talked about the tool challenges from

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:45,240
either save all the boxes for example

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:49,650
automotive and promoter system as

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,710
compared with international economy

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,340
doesn't Astana so we have created a

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,470
compact procedure development point of

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,580
all we have to divide the little bug

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:08,040
from our design

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:12,990
Oren how is relief only we also do the

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:17,370
taxes such losers to expand protocol but

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:22,580
in general we use act user such rules

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:26,430
for general including on our committee

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:32,970
we also wanted to effect a big night and

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:35,970
subscribe in midnight we are not we need

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:40,170
to provide the solutions we like that so

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:44,070
we recognize with am i some laundry and

00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:48,540
vendor an application vendors so this

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:52,740
output will be some subtle compiled an

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:59,070
axe and a motor down automotive group

00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:03,150
body really heavily juices out second

00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:06,110
one is of a compiler that is a very

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:10,370
there goes our combined company

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:15,430
with tarragon we should not violate the

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:20,300
Tigers missional to earn enough

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:25,340
interesting prize so to avoid these the

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:29,080
race we adjourn for things examine both

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:34,610
why the implemented in house new

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:37,550
development and life and also to employ

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:41,950
a schedule it does why the reading of

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,950
arabic uber organize information

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:51,920
impression and I never even saw through

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:55,160
these activities we understand there are

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,770
lots of choices without license file so

00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,520
we don't understand what what which

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:06,650
license can be applied to go open source

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:09,770
of Vegas there are lot of license which

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:13,610
in serie but that is different from

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:18,410
Oregon one so we have to check every

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:19,370
every team all licenses are we in this

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:25,850
database

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:31,070
a thousand licenses one we picked up a

00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:36,020
hundred clan ago new form of the ten

00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:39,320
times our civilization so we we think of

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:44,830
the activity of experiencing expecting

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:50,920
so delicious over your are joining work

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:50,920
to progress with the activity

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,179
[Music]
