so think of this almost like the u-clips

00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,420
community and support for the other DLCs

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,099
and smart contract engines is something

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,099
folks are interested in working on

00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:18,029
that's all the kind of the geek side of

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,220
things and obviously that's where my

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,050
heart is but it wouldn't matter much if

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,150
this wasn't actually getting a

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,189
subtraction out there in the market yeah

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,539
we're very kind of the germ Hut very

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,790
cautious because everything is still

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,559
pretty one dot oh but there's a lot of

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,410
appetite out there now that take even

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,390
even these early versions of the code I

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,120
put them into pilots and proof of

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,920
concepts at the very least in fact over

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,989
the last three months we tracked that

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,239
any different announcements of proofs of

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,950
concept projects out there and this

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,750
might sound silly like all those you do

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,969
with give a proof of concept of setting

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,500
up a website on our own laptop right but

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,480
at a proof of concept in a blockchain

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,730
never usually involves more than one

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,440
company usually involves a whole lot of

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,860
work down and try to model a business

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,510
processor and so usually these aren't

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,340
even launched until you know a year or

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,220
two and to kind of decide ok let's do a

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,140
project together and so this is this is

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,540
good validation will all be really happy

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,820
when these moves to pilots and to

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,220
production there are already four or

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,619
five private deployments state

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,149
production I think tracked by IBM right

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,429
there

00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:28,189
they're their sales and engineering team

00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:31,549
I put a quite a few public pilots now

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,409
that are getting mentioned and this many

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,969
of the companies mentioned here in these

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:35,659
announcements have our members of hyper

00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:39,890
ledger

00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,149
ttcc IBM cm x sum of money images of the

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,729
Bank of Cambodia that's pretty

00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:45,590
interesting right it's a kind of a

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:47,390
left-field kind of a candidate but

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,369
they're pretty excited and they glad to

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,060
put software developers on the project

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:55,549
which is pretty cool I that Sheila the

00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,539
National Stock Exchange of Chile is also

00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,020
enough that's right

00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:00,890
so this really is a global kind of thing

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,219
in fact I think I've mentioned before

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,750
when I talked about this before we have

00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:08,030
but we could certainly have a lot of

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:11,120
participation from our Japanese

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,709
community I get to the project and

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,980
increasingly we're also saying

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,530
participation from members on China as

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,390
well in other parts of Asia so we're

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,660
really thinking of this as a global

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,340
effort we're getting a lot of attention

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,700
out there at all involved this too much

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,470
because but corresponding to the

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,269
attention that vlogging technologies are

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,470
having people are being waking up to the

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:38,840
fact that I in fact one article recently

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,359
out there I suggested that maybe

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,370
blockchain technology isn't like the

00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:45,859
Internet so far as it's not going to be

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,569
like out with Google you know where

00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:49,700
there were like big financial returns

00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:52,130
for bunch of really companies but maybe

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,280
maybe launching technology is more like

00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,079
what Linux has been which is you know if

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
you try to be an investor investing in

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:02,150
Linux in 1998

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,740
99 it was really hard right to figure

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,140
out a good to make any money from that

00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,110
but Linux has had this dramatic economic

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,330
impact upon every company in the

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,040
technology sector right and helped build

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,350
dramatic new companies I don't know that

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,930
you would see AWS today the hatton infra

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:21,590
Linux I think you would see Google today

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,360
that says relax right and so there are

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,820
many people suspecting that this will be

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,739
an underlying kind of current even while

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,750
another part of the industry focus is

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,360
very much on icos and the price of

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,980
Bitcoin and that sort of thing so we're

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,330
really excited about the attention that

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,370
this other side of the equation is

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,970
getting and they have a very active blog

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,750
with our community now contributing a

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,070
huge portion of the content to that wall

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,930
and this would really be meaningful

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,390
unless we were also talking about those

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,950
developer metrics but also about the

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,200
kind of companies that are becoming hard

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,670
what we're doing just like automotive

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,489
grade Linux which is growing like

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,230
gangbusters just like CN CF the cloud

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,300
native computing foundation which is

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,880
growing quickly we're seeing a lot of

00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,799
new members joining hyper ledger as well

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,430
just in the last few months we've grown

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,829
to over 140 memory co-sponsoring members

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,630
these are companies that not only are

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,130
you know believing what we do and maybe

00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,140
working with the code they've actually

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,900
made a financial contribution to the

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,640
project which allows by 7-9 to wake up

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,800
every morning get involved in the

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,660
project right I did think about doing

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,080
all the things that developers trying to

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:33,260
knowing everything from the legal terms

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,900
and the marketing getting the word out

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,970
to running the continuous integration

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,250
servers you know the kinds of things the

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,530
Linux Foundation really pioneered with

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,510
the legs community and now is being

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,390
replicated by all the other projects

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,610
under the leg span we have also added

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,070
three new premier member

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,840
in that period of time these are really

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,270
the ones that contributed the top level

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,970
and there's three very different

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,560
companies one of them is SAV which I'm

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,650
sure you're familiar with is really big

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,680
and supply chain and ERP types of

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:09,010
applications yeah that's where I saw a

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,080
presentation from their CTO there their

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,360
global kind of developer day where they

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,400
said this is our you know core part of

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,660
our products today the architecture of

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,820
our products all these different boxes

00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,050
layered on top with another and they

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,970
said this is what we'll be in three

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,380
years or two years and every one of

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,620
those boxes have like a little hyper

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,300
ledger green box and embedded inside so

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,280
they really see reinventing their

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,960
business particularly their arena

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,300
business through the use of blockchain

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,010
technology another big one is a

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,800
healthcare company called change

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,930
healthcare which dies a us-based

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,510
healthcare company about 15,000

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,630
employees they may handle a double-digit

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,690
percentage of a claims processing in the

00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,880
United States healthcare and we have

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,350
several other healthcare members but the

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,420
healthcare sector is going to be really

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,090
good evening for blockchain technology

00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,440
particularly if we can address these

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,500
issues around personally identifiable

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,840
information and the third member that

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,700
goal here markup pretty soon is NEC

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,400
we're really happy to be welcoming them

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:12,820
and I'll let them talk about

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,410
about that so so yeah so a lot of kind

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,600
of positive momentum for membership

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,669
front I develop earn community is

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,320
growing really strong and people are

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,110
recognizing I think that that what we're

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,840
doing at hi pearl is really meaningful

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,789
this is a quote I won't read it but it's

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,240
from an analyst out there pretty widely

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:33,550
regarded who I basically is talking

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,100
about how every one of these markets is

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,199
going to get reinvented through the use

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,080
of law change technology every market

00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,270
out there typically is dependent upon a

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,580
seminal company to manage market to

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:50,080
provide the system of accounts all that

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,449
and that has been sometimes that works

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,190
oftentimes there's there's ease of all

00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,229
of that often times that limits the

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,860
amount of innovation that's possible in

00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,800
those markets

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,199
if you remake it as a distributed ledger

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,690
platform you open up the potential to do

00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,120
something a lot bigger and so what he's

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,530
saying is the the number of use cases

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,780
recovering the number of companies

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,180
getting involved it is really validation

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,010
of the model and frankly to that we have

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,349
the Linux community to think and the

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,479
Linux Foundation to think because you

00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:21,099
know I think that's the community that

00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,560
it really pioneered this concept of

00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:24,970
getting different kinds of organizations

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,919
to work together on common

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,720
infrastructure on common plumbing and

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:32,080
hyper ledger is just carrying that

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,510
forward so with that I think I've run

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,159
out of time if you have any questions

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,320
I'll try to float around the conference

00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,500
the rest of the day but thank you very

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,500
