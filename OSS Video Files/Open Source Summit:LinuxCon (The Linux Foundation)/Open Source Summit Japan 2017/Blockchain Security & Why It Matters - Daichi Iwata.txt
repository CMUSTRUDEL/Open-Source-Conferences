Title: Blockchain Security & Why It Matters - Daichi Iwata
Publication date: 2017-06-26
Playlist: Open Source Summit Japan 2017
Description: 
	New technologies, namely driven by open source communities, are accelerating digital transformation. Blockchain is one of such technologies. Unique feature about Blockchain, compared to other technologies, is power of trust needed in digital age. Its power enables a person, or small community to be as trustful as big enterprises. Blockchain also empowers a person to control back ownership of their digital assets including personal information. These power of Blockchain comes from its security. Blockchain security will be increasingly important in coming digital age. NEC Research Lab in EU has been leading academic research on Blockchain security since the beginning of bitcoin. With strong background of Blockchain security research lab, NEC will contribute more on open source community.

thank you very much our next kilos

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:16,800
trigger is a 90-day program office at

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,869
NEC corporation and he also are leading

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,390
the party bridge ever at NEC

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,820
and today he will be speaking about

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,820
rupture security and why is important

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,540
hi my name is Joshua died from NEC

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:50,950
compressions and I'm bleeding a butcher

00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:54,940
project within my company and at least

00:00:50,950 --> 00:01:05,140
last year I'm really itching sensations

00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:07,300
with love we have that has been leading

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,330
the project security academic research

00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:15,280
and I am really happy to Shelly that I

00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:17,050
capture the conversations I am so when

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,930
talking about in the Eustis of the

00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,479
portion is coming up with started

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,840
thinking about the business case of

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,660
public services that not traditional

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,580
business cases the personal traditional

00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,220
relationship of the enterprise division

00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,380
series not the best of the traditional

00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:39,100
functions I think about change and the

00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,140
power transforming the outlines of

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,360
industries and it's not only about the

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,340
world shape anything for you are selling

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,460
to because of forming our industries and

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,470
I think this is the one with the way

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,740
that we will be in a very exciting time

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,960
and the open source projects of those

00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,600
are driving a force of these desolate of

00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,970
angels and he have to be contributing to

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,480
the project like an opera star at open

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:07,210
daylight and a block shake movie

00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,910
you tomorrow and that we then launch and

00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:14,890
will play a very vital role in crypto in

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:17,620
this current escalation because thinking

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,990
we need edge don't trust your system

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,630
you're acting just on a test across will

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,720
be more important and if everything is

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,520
more connected and so on and I mention a

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,080
little bit departing you know as the

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,810
internet glows how you care about the

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,270
muscle regulations you know when think

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,760
is a more connected they will give more

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,800
of my hustle regulation or your possible

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,020
information through the activities

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,450
through your bottoms or afternoon

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,430
activities in your home things they

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,860
connected it in will generate viewing

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,740
permissions and why information holding

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,240
up more article because are the second

00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,060
data will be next to all of the money

00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,850
right now but for now it is very hard

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,900
for me to claim why personal information

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:07,660
is mine and it's very hard to locate

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,860
while my information is use whether who

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,890
use my permission

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,310
an option by be able to transform

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,739
don't change Kevin finally able to annoy

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,320
you not you can talk whether your

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,180
information is used and if you claim

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,990
that you eat or interviewers

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,950
so I think what chairman

00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:32,190
exciting power and about luggage and we

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,040
please come as a 421 it's all security

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,280
design and the problem of share of the

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,210
trucks forgives I think it's a beauty of

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:46,020
the creative designer critic policy one

00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:49,560
of the applications of both chain people

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:52,470
relying on the blog's expertise to store

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,240
and exchange their coins people not

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,700
relying on the idea of authorization

00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,850
without about you to store the of your

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,820
valuable coins and into exchange to one

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,770
hour so in general you can trust the

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,310
system it's all security designed to

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:10,050
sell to store your distal asset and

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,960
transaction that test about that that is

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,690
important so I think this is a very

00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,180
exciting thing it should improve

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:21,000
improving object security so that we can

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,350
come up with is new business and your

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,550
public is opposite that is more

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,980
innovative and that is what Russell body

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:32,100
that in the blockchain security you know

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:36,000
has a lot of components likely as check

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,750
always use or product poverty based on

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,700
signatures things like that and think of

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,130
that eyeball and if there are so many

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:50,630
things are being tested now is the

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:53,550
consensus consensus hormone you like to

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:56,700
to make an agreement along the

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,410
distributing computing networks and it

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,140
gives a lot changing by design

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:06,879
distributed computing network it allows

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:10,460
us to do Jocasta soggiest all only

00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:13,699
allows us to hodda Saudis on the white

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,279
multi state motorists of artery my

00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,229
knowledge in departure but in the

00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,110
context of work allows us to make an

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,860
agreement and the midpoint is pronounced

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:27,050
double spending and it ugly from the

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,990
history of transactions and in general

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,259
census make an agreement with a fantasy

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,960
and it modifies an aorta and the array

00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:39,589
on the order of transactions so it is

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,759
really interesting product what you look

00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,330
at us so today I want to focus on how

00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,599
interesting the problem with the

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,300
consensus protocol innovations so when

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:52,550
you want to design the consensus

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,319
protocol it's a very simple thing but

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:58,930
you have to be aware were to muzzle

00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:02,389
variants of one is customers so when

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:06,050
must sudden now no computer no sparse

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:09,589
painting in the consensus stock

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,469
responding you gather the consensus so

00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:14,959
they have to tolerate concern are cut

00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:17,689
you have to remove the computer knows

00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:22,580
that failed or you have to go have the

00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:25,309
backup system that's the criteria it's

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,169
more like traditional headers but more

00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:29,089
how did you draw it and when they do

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:32,509
it's more important is what's going to

00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:34,519
be Santa Clara so the consensus of elves

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,699
Gautama gives only in the computer never

00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,520
stops responding to the knowledge keeps

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,400
with Molly

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,889
start making a lot and it about census

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,009
fellows I think this is more important

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,409
because in front everything is connected

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:52,319
some people start making some washes you

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,319
know behavior and started making a lie

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,210
in the case of the coins or you use that

00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,060
may be claiming you have more money that

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:02,819
you really have they accompany that it

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,669
is to qualify if that is something you

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,340
needed you agree on a boggling aspect

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:11,130
your computing comes it's not origin

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,960
what you believe it's not you know what

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,500
other point you come praying something

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,050
is the Parliament not my computers even

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,990
more transactions are down through the

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,150
IOT devices or in automotive twenties

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,940
there are the limitations which involve

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,430
a became more agree with this process so

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,310
I'm going all about the community knows

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,250
just detecting a few online is very

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,580
exciting new topics but because this is

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,750
a complex issues the very values or

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,090
example fella

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,719
trolland book or have just come into the

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:51,050
practice for been a few years ago so one

00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:51,050
of the famous one is of course the true

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:57,220
like a going in the ignorant and

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,680
in the other one is going to PDF key

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,810
that has been proposed for one of the

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,849
project of the high bridges and in the

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,940
other one is it like something like 500

00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:10,539
right said for proposed for the high

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,360
collegiate of a program so there are

00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:16,990
lots of protocol has been proposed and

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,220
start evolving so some people are trying

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,289
to pull the ball is a really interesting

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,820
and things you will go and I think it

00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:26,440
will be very critical technology for

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:30,030
ensuring the trust among the connected

00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,370
in histories and it goes above the

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,800
premium T of the battles BBF D has been

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,649
proposed and keeper all things probably

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:43,659
focus only the history believe every a

00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:46,240
little bit so PDF 3 was proposing 1989

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:50,410
to probably be more than beginning of a

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,200
bit more and it assumes that you have to

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,959
know the god speed us cutting we know as

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,730
you all are so it's not like a car like

00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,420
in the beauty mark you have to know who

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,880
are the most fun don't knows the dance

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,390
there are assumption would be crafty but

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,850
because it was also SH not doesn't trust

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,130
each other you have to you know change

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,610
each other to negative area so

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:18,130
communication routes of this beauty are

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,170
really good place so you have some

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,810
limitations of our to scalability and

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,740
performance and throughput so people

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:30,120
start looking for more efficient PFT so

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,120
