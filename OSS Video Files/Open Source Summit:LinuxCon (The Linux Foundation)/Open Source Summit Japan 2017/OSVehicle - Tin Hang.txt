preoccupied work greater innovation now

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:15,570
in merging okay within traditional oil

00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:18,470
this as I move there and this is what's

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:23,430
happening right now okay so we are

00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:26,880
already photo I'm shaking margins are

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:30,390
getting over and over it is very hard to

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,000
sell complete peoples in people's food

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,600
in generation because they don't share

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,489
not only the latest generation car they

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:46,440
care more about owning the latest iPhone

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:51,059
in services like car sharing price

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,699
sharing the Cougar feeding even to

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,129
delivering everything now important and

00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:01,410
we know that you can have a personal

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:07,560
driver you can get food you can get your

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:11,729
your own packages a at home evening also

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,840
we are shifting to we're heading over at

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,900
most a dream sustainable future of

00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,680
sanitation integrating environment has

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,540
any total section of you like making a

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,630
paper card a concern

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:34,920
lose a field unfortunately just

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:37,770
occurring battery in our vehicle from

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,100
now it not in our because we have to

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,290
change waiting on fashion invited you

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,570
here produce

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:51,440
recycle be deafening primary image from

00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:58,610
the economies in Germany does not need

00:01:51,440 --> 00:02:02,630
to be asked to Union and I want to play

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:04,790
a little game with you in Italy we have

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,850
a very successful car sharing owned by

00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:12,280
the biggest energy convert then you can

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:16,160
change the Italian divine car frame and

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:20,930
usually in the ownership call they let

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:24,710
you be better than users so I'll get

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:29,030
under heavy usage how many years is

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:35,720
between vehicle and who say it's five

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:44,390
years later Han okay one what about all

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:50,000
you a three years angle hand what about

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:52,340
you okay I had a very interfering with

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,070
them and actually they told me there's a

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,720
reliable or gradually that it left

00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:03,519
lessons we use that they'll go so great

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:08,780
between they are buying how computers

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,830
and after revenue which oil way as I you

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:17,209
mountain will be so very unsustainable

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:23,170
financially and in also environmentally

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,170
and the government's movement providers

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:32,600
also everyone now are putting human

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:35,780
ecology confuse people and technology

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,870
might connected convolution among

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:45,420
teachers either forever but the NASA

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:49,049
pretty well you know his feature in

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:55,290
Italy because it unveiled in Italian

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:56,700
which means Christmas tree venerable in

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,099
the spherical darling

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,459
most of the companies call them like lab

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,459
on wheels

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:12,000
so we have to change our way of thinking

00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:16,320
how we design vehicle how we engineer

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,949
how to produce recycle upgrade and

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,130
that's a second ok how the parable

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,830
competition should be actually we

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:29,699
collected a lot of data that's the my

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:33,600
clinical approach we interview all our

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:38,789
potential customers and customers also

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,039
human drivers current bachelors and the

00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:44,690
cup of the future should be rather than

00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:48,720
the driven approach often we green using

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:52,229
battery electric powertrain the possible

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:57,630
giving energy renewable sources like for

00:04:52,229 --> 00:05:02,639
farm if possible also easy to repair

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:05,610
anything poverty aleykÃ¼m selam world the

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,190
terrible future should be also designed

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,789
and engineered for services because

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,099
people are caring more now instead of

00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:17,820
only a meter in a big pyramid for chips

00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:20,389
and press people so expensive and also

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,870
it very hard to find a parking

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:28,110
experience a people be able to have a

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,570
very reliable service take over that

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,080
ain't better meaning the traveling

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,249
they're taking you from A to B and most

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,489
of the time they don't swing chair

00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:42,399
people or the design of the view they

00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:47,679
care more about experience so we have to

00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:50,709
focus more on this model and the count

00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:55,589
of the future is going to have more and

00:05:50,709 --> 00:06:02,379
more community computing power analog TV

00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:05,169
filtration from fortune selling radical

00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:13,599
controlling initially how would you

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:17,499
select normal I like this concept but I

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,589
think it is not very cool right in fact

00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:25,209
it's more normal

00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:28,209
quite a problematic here all the form

00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:31,029
factor of the people and a very mobile

00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:32,709
feline data mark already there is none I

00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:36,069
will

00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:39,719
comparing instead we have our vision

00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:39,719
more similar who can help

00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:46,029
unfortunately the resolution is very

00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:48,519
good but is like a computer

00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:52,360
overview actually hit with a very

00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:54,969
interesting three from detail FA as you

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,989
need to go and you should have no car

00:06:54,969 --> 00:07:03,369
just super computer from you and we

00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:05,229
Bavaria mainly because the target user

00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:09,129
should be more focused on service with a

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:10,409
big object and eventually it won't you

00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:14,069
won't have vehicle

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:17,399
running every year so we can replace

00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:20,759
parts using just like the TV Expo or

00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:25,039
workstation or server you can change the

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:27,629
tribute to lazy or even upgraded and

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:35,759
obviously the contractor should be more

00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:40,619
kind of evil here also it's very

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:45,449
important to empower services to have a

00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:49,519
better liquid divinium service so this

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:55,069
could be a ride-sharing harm it could be

00:07:49,519 --> 00:08:04,259
eagle for delivering or unfollow people

00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:10,639
or to deliver air the last topic is

00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:14,490
coming together with article wheels

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,459
first of all we have to change our

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:22,679
language instead of a political in close

00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:27,449
applause so more horizontal and open so

00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:29,639
we have to first make some arm in

00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,889
open-source okay

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,459
especially the code amount of the

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:40,620
hardware you're checking here it will

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:45,649
reduce to how many time because in

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:48,029
Silicon Valley we had a conference Japan

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:52,860
companies are painting a lot of

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:57,059
performance time money invested in the

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,790
link reverse engineering trying to adapt

00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:04,170
that the Congress back in the people in

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:07,740
front and on code so we have to provide

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:10,720
verification the owners will give the

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,760
time the paradigm

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,990
the Rebbe engineering hopefully will be

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:20,290
possible and health holidays to provide

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,590
modules I connected car modules and

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:29,470
riding models it can be seamlessly

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:33,040
integrating computers faster another

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,990
important thing so this contact today is

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,720
more similar to a temple extreme

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:45,040
motivation obviously with a variable

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:47,770
factor and the second thing thing that

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,760
we need to really embrace even

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:55,570
modularity modularity also called

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,280
attributable body so we call bodies they

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:01,740
are providing learning with like Google

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,780
Wave Dornish they can easily customize

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,590
in your body

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:11,410
ok without making the game from scratch

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:16,390
the global certification said we can

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:20,100
make painful game and also especially

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:22,690
very important exterior modularity to

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,260
accommodate new technologies like then

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:29,410
we have the point the Christmas tree or

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,990
Latin wheel so we should have a better

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:40,480
approach for a treat including

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:44,620
integrating design phase obviously it's

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,430
very very important to have the most

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,080
knowledgeable

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:54,140
they electronoggin the battery packs

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,779
another Shastri who came up ahead after

00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:00,920
that you can replace on part and you're

00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:03,470
not showing a way with words this is the

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,570
only way to solve the financial

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,959
investment environment effective

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:16,790
services and roberto cavalli competitive

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:22,399
seven enabling intuitive and popularity

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:25,250
in interiors so in the medium-term won't

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,620
replace and would have been a revolution

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:32,360
there are sensors inside a vehicle

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:35,390
currently powers in cable services also

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:41,560
we want to change some are invading see

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:45,620
a armrest even tables after heavy usage

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:50,270
want to play instead of throwing away by

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:53,690
you being able make long-term also with

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:57,410
the regulation are ready for it also to

00:11:53,690 --> 00:12:02,890
remove the fusion to take the strong fit

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:06,020
and flip it to have a bigger the layout

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,420
so you can write your email you can work

00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:12,230
with your life it will conference watch

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:19,790
a movie okay in the demo file economic

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:26,779
scenario the bad news is that local

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:29,300
local natural affinity except also

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,990
conservative are using vehicle design

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,990
engineer

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:42,720
in their services the good news is that

00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:45,210
we are doing so again is not only

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,940
putting batteries with the vehicle we

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,900
have to think about modularity we have

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,560
to design an engineer car core services

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:58,830
allow easy repair ability and upgrade

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:04,100
ability not only things we volunteer our

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:06,600
radius often also ha so but actually

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:10,680
people that are using our technology

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,100
like 10 times more triple people that

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,660
are two years to that after 20 ships and

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:19,530
the business one is very injured because

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:22,680
we're not pushing covering the final car

00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:25,680
there we are providing the services to

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:31,080
retain power that's what you want by an

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:35,570
office and this is a video that shows

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,570
our native products contagious

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,050
[Music]

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:46,530
introducing the review of the omron

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:51,530
industry be ready to use road-legal

00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:53,940
we've designed and engineered in Italy

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,209
featuring a platform that is an entire

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,949
amount

00:13:55,209 --> 00:14:01,869
allowing vehicle to attach to any
