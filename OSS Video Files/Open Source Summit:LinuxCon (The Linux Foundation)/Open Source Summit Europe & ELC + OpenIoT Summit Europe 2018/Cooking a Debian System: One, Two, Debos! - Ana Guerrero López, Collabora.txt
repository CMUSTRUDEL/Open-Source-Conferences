	Cooking a Debian System: One, Two, Debos! - Ana Guerrero L贸pez, Collabora

 Customized Debian images can now be created in a quick and reproducible way!

In the Debian world, there are many ways to build images, but none of them are generic enough to allow highly customized systems for different use cases or embedded systems, which usually require a significant amount of customization and optimization.

Traditionally, developers often end up using debootstrap, which works by
downloading the .deb files from a mirror and unpacking them into a directory which can eventually be chrooted into. Then, after deboostraping the base system, you tend to make some customizations on this image, install some extra packages, run a script, add some files, etc. debos is a tool to make these kinds of trivial tasks easier.

During this talk, we'll look at how debos works and provide some use cases, and we'll give an overview of how to easily create customized Debian images.
