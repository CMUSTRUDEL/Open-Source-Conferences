Description: 
	Cooking a Debian System: One, Two, Debos! - Ana Guerrero López, Collabora

 Customized Debian images can now be created in a quick and reproducible way!

In the Debian world, there are many ways to build images, but none of them are generic enough to allow highly customized systems for different use cases or embedded systems, which usually require a significant amount of customization and optimization.

Traditionally, developers often end up using debootstrap, which works by
downloading the .deb files from a mirror and unpacking them into a directory which can eventually be chrooted into. Then, after deboostraping the base system, you tend to make some customizations on this image, install some extra packages, run a script, add some files, etc. debos is a tool to make these kinds of trivial tasks easier.

During this talk, we'll look at how debos works and provide some use cases, and we'll give an overview of how to easily create customized Debian images.

okay so thank you everybody for

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,170
attending I'm very happy to see you're

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:12,570
here my name is Anna get her Lopez I

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,940
haven't considered into this over for

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,039
like 18 years now mostly today very

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,570
unpro yet probably you have seen my name

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,060
before it has been something with the

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,550
tellurian I have been working at Cola or

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,230
as news earlier this year and today I

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,439
would like to present something cool

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,650
that we have on a cloud that is called

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,899
DevOps so let's start with the

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:38,219
presentation what is the boss so the

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,320
boss is a tool we technical that is used

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,780
to create Debian images and you also can

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,030
use it for the V&A robotics so when I

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:53,010
say images here is Romania images docker

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:58,010
containers had these images developments

00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,809
is sisterhood everything you can imagine

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,300
so there was creates an imagined

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:07,320
following a series of steps that you are

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,080
providing in a recipe file currently we

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,990
have 12 option actions that you can use

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,760
for trade image and one of the most

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,770
interesting things you don't need to be

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,869
root for creating the producing that was

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,830
done creating the images we will see

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:25,590
later why so from the very beginning

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,240
when we design the works is because we

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,950
need is something that we call cool

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,380
black easily in your continuous

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,360
integration system so from the very

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,750
beginning the focus of this tool has

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,720
been easier to to to work in this kind

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,460
of workflow it's also modular so if

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,380
somebody wants to implement a new action

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,729
it shouldn't be very difficult to do we

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,549
have interfering with all our

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:50,040
collections

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:52,470
the recipes are written in general but

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,759
is not fully journal we also will see

00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:00,000
later with an example why and of course

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,250
you can run there was in the any Linux

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,159
system but if you are not using the

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:10,530
Rihanna probably your best bet is using

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:12,190
a container so which architectures are

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,080
supported by Devils

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,880
a priori you come you can use it in any

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,580
architecture that is supported by a

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,420
chemo and it's also available in the

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:31,750
area however we only have destiny in a

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:35,080
handful of of them mostly am mix x86 it

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,780
also can work potentially with with 564

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:44,260
that this day the Damien port of his

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:45,760
five I said potentially because this 564

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,340
is still not fully functional in the

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,350
area the pieces are coming together it

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,450
will be in the future but not yet but

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:57,510
the day is there you will be able to to

00:02:52,450 --> 00:03:00,310
create a route affairs with the box so

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,940
this is maybe the most complicated a

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,390
slider for the presentation DevOps is

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:11,770
using something called effect matching

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,690
under the hood for allowing you to to

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,680
use the balls we have inner route and

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:20,820
also for first set up in the chemo so

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,570
you are able to to create images in

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,500
architecture that are no the one in

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:30,660
Rojas matching so sex matching is going

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,400
to create a nice firm build one machine

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:37,060
setting up chemo system using the s

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,810
slash us us air from new system so once

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:44,200
you have that DevOps is going to use

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:48,130
Kimmy Teemo Teemo user emulation for

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,230
being able to to room binaries of

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,300
foreign architecture what I mean with a

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,269
foreign architecture is for probably

00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,880
your host matching is ha nd 64 well I am

00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:01,120
talking in Debian post and maybe you

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,610
want to create an image of from arm so

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,910
that's what a foreign architectural

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,980
means on this context and then there was

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,670
is going to have a root privilege in

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,590
this match in that you have set up

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:17,380
something also important is for free

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,820
matching to work your user needs to have

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,130
permission to a /dev a /qm and this is

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,930
actually one of the defendants doing the

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,110
trick

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,610
root privileges and also if you want to

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,470
have good performance you really need

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:37,350
that so also it's important to explain

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,389
what is notables so it's not wheel

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,750
system you are using their am behind or

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,550
you derivative for our distribution if

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,990
you want to put something that is now

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,970
available in the end you will have to do

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,370
own package have it in your own

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,789
repository and using stole it later in

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,410
the image it also is important to say

00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,850
that is not the official way of

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,520
installing them does it a be an

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,460
installer maybe that rule is the same

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,530
but I want report in book so problem

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:12,570
that you phone is something important to

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:15,240
specify so probably you are ready to try

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,639
to will are added an image in the in the

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,270
past you have a like a para o plenty of

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,070
tools that you can use there are so many

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,949
I cannot really make a comparison of

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,050
them but if you are curious we have a

00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,870
page from the dev young wiki where you

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,370
can check all of them I'm finally there

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:39,180
is something better for what you need or

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:41,310
not so who is using the verbs so there

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,930
is the apparatus Pro yet there is an

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,770
infrastructure tailored for the

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,199
automotive needs and all the things it's

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,010
an infrastructure abilities and one of

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,389
the thing they are providing our

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,699
repositories of packages because it's a

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,580
mix between jung-geun to and even

00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,259
derivative and they are using the rules

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,960
for creating the images they are

00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,960
providing so if you are curious to see

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,479
the image for during that URL

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:15,030
they are also publishing the devil's

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:18,360
recipe they are using other project is a

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:25,490
kernel see I got order is a service that

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:29,460
is service that distributive is destined

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:32,159
Ostrom Linux kernel basically what

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,460
conocí ID does is will many trees of the

00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:38,200
Debian kernel makes food taste I also

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,650
have some test plan for

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,860
a social system that I felt home I have

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:47,530
immune test animals is being used for

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,660
creating these images that are used that

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,020
are used with the test for for testing

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,120
the kernel if you are interested in the

00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,880
kernel CI project I am giving a

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:03,190
presentation on Wednesday about it and

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,620
when I was preparing the presentation I

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,290
decide to check if somebody else was

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,670
using they was out there and actually I

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,830
found a very nice examples the - a first

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:18,600
example there of each avianna ACMA

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,550
system are to embed board and they are

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,290
they have all good example what you can

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:29,350
do with the ropes the field one is from

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,730
plasma mobile plus mama why Lisa present

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,040
are you using the via naturally there

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:36,280
shoka's showcasing it in the kid evolved

00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,250
if you are interested they are using the

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,480
was for wielding the images for testing

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,690
their system so they are doing

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,700
continuous development and it was was

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,050
for them the perfect tool for for

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,440
creating the image is fantastic that

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:56,770
they that the laptop using plasma mobile

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:59,440
was working frame so I think after the

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,720
presentation the best we can do is doing

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,200
a chicken on a small example of what you

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,940
can do with the Rose so and it will be

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:13,300
like a minimum recipe that you can

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:16,480
create so here we are targeting arm hot

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:21,130
fluid that is like Debian poor for a

00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,740
city to do to be a flop is they were

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,870
strapping and that to a step the fifth

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,180
one is they were strapped in a variant

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,210
such a route we will see later what they

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,880
will strap is exactly and the second one

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:37,570
is just making a turbine with the such a

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,900
route so this is like a minimum you can

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:44,920
do of course most of the time you want

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,860
to do way more than that here you have a

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,210
smaller example of how the application

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,490
run you can see that

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:57,970
every step they were strapped on puck is

00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:01,060
Mark here when we start him so is easy

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:05,650
to see which a step is being run every

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:07,660
time something else interesting is you

00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,790
can see that here the image is taking

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,460
something like five minutes to be more

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:14,380
or less and then there is a pouring off

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,990
of the beautiful matching and suddenly

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,470
there is to our more it's because the

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,980
images are created the bill Tomatina

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:31,240
with UTC time so I am told to two hours

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:33,070
ahead that the earthís example was like

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,260
hard coding that I wanted to do a memory

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:40,450
for our arm in Debian in stretch what

00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,570
happened if you want to do the same for

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:46,180
several DVM releases or even you to one

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,590
and you will also want to change

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,880
architecture so you can use parameters

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,470
this is actually one of the cool thing

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,300
we can do because we're using the go

00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:01,270
template package take slash template so

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,980
we might want to run for a sample levels

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:08,710
and say sweet a stretch and key tag 2 nd

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,270
6400 might want to to create a match for

00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:16,150
Buster and that is the next day and

00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:19,780
release the nexus table for am 64 so we

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:22,540
have an example we want parameters so

00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:27,070
here we will be using the the

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:29,380
architecture parameter and in the top we

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,050
are putting the result so in case we

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:36,220
don't provide a parameter in the command

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:38,020
line it will take the letter for one the

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,450
same for the suite well all the Damien

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,000
release and then we have a third

00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:46,240
parameter that is a imagining the toggle

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,570
what's going here that we can create

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,190
from the other two so and we will have

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,640
every term back with a different name

00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:57,280
depending on what we are building or

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,440
there are the nice thing of them or the

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,520
templating system of go is we also can

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,660
use conditionals

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:07,050
so you know we can have some

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,920
some actions that are implementing

00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,680
depending on the parameters we have

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,230
provide so if we have a parameter called

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,130
a type equals two tools

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:22,720
this step will be run but if not they

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:25,930
will skip this step you know you can do

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,120
this at level of action but you also can

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:36,910
use to us a small part of it like this

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:38,590
example so I say in the beginning that

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,890
there are 12 action of the boss are

00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,850
followed them all of this here I

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,250
underlined to spring all of them

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,610
especially the O's three ones kind of

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:51,940
require armed and a new presentation

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,830
introducing what is Austrian soon in all

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,820
format example we used a bootstrap

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,860
unpack so they would strap is something

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,780
that is very known for everybody who's

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,060
using Davi and all have tried to develop

00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,490
a bit on the area but probably is no

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,400
known to everybody so I wanted to

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:12,580
explain it quickly so basically what

00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,680
they will subdue it is allowing you the

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,290
installation of a Libyan base system

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,840
from a scratch so it's going to do not

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,700
over the live from a living a mirror and

00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,530
it's going to create a sachet with them

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,390
we have use him DP key or apt and this

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,810
such a route is going to be like a other

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,910
DVM based system we have I mean that you

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,900
can no good you cannot do anything but

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:41,080
it's a chroot if you want to know more

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,940
about this and in the Navy on wiki there

00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,410
is Hollywood actress dice explaining

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:51,210
everything quite well and I think we can

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:54,250
go to explain the most relevant actions

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,350
the first one is apt I think this one is

00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:00,100
if you have used the young is kind of

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,660
obvious after you have a do strap a

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,110
system the first thing you might want to

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:08,830
do is install in packets so with apt you

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:11,940
put action apt and you list all the

00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,940
packages you want install

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:18,069
here is the example from the beginning

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,040
what I have replaced the second master

00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:22,240
for a pity so there is actually an

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,389
option that you can use that is

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,190
recommend by default in Damian you are

00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:31,800
installing a package with all its

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:35,500
dependencies and all the recommends line

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,970
you can use the recommends parameter to

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,589
avoid installing the recommend

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,019
especially if you want to create a small

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:43,149
system if you are user you probably want

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,889
to install or me if you are using the

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:49,689
via desktop machine you probably want to

00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:53,439
install the recommends so here in

00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:56,110
example I have done something different

00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:58,870
to the m2 the sample from the beginning

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,569
has been components I put name country

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,269
unknown free so I put nam free because I

00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:06,040
want to install frequently looks that is

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:08,290
now available in the in the main

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,959
repository of the area because what is

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,189
there being actually is a young main

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,800
everything else countries are non free

00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:17,529
are lied to as component out there for

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,300
people's convenience but they don't form

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,300
they had no parent but is vivianne

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:26,560
proper so of him we want to install

00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:33,220
finger so we need to - atom 3 4 4 having

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:36,009
it available to apt so obviously when we

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,709
are holding images often we want to add

00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:41,740
files maybe from the intranet from other

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:44,500
place there is a command for doing that

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,720
and also integrating in the system for

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,720
example here I am downloading an

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,759
attacker off finger and I am telling the

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,360
box that it will be available with the

00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:58,809
name of finger also there is a tube

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,819
chance that is unpack because especially

00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:04,600
we want to do know a few files they will

00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:08,379
be compressed the kind of compression we

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,870
are using it's important to say that

00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:13,540
this action is not going to play the

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,629
files inside the system we are creating

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,790
we are just going to refer it and if we

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:21,639
want to copy then in the assistant I

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,200
will show you later how to do that with

00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:29,470
the overlay action

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:31,269
so we want to install the a file we have

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,920
downloaded man maybe we want used to

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:37,620
copy files that we have in our system

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:41,220
that that into the into the new imaging

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:47,170
so we do that with the overnight action

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:48,760
so origin we use this when we are when

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,260
we want to create something that we have

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,829
done a lot before and we have referred

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,570
with the with a name if no we don't put

00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,880
the we don't use origin and we only need

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,029
to use source for pointing at what we

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,370
want to copy and then the destination

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,199
directory in case we don't want to copy

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,290
that in the root directory or the new

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,630
image we are creating so this is a bit

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:15,970
complicated to see only with the action

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:18,910
so the base here is an example and so we

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,130
have here three actions the first one is

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,880
they don't know what and then we have to

00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:27,100
action overlay so the first action is

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,060
exactly what we saw before is zoom

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:35,820
nothing finger from somewhere I'm naming

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:38,440
it finger the second action is overlay

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,769
where we are setting on we want to copy

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:45,130
things from our film finger that we have

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:48,370
to load before and then we say okay so

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,649
inside film where there is a directory

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,829
called finger finger reversal we are

00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:55,990
using the the parameters but and we want

00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:58,930
to copy that in your image in boot

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,890
finger so for example we have done wad I

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:05,309
don't know finger for the raspberry peep

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:08,530
we use copy exactly this they would

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:13,059
directory from the from the turbo into

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:18,549
boot finger the second order light

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:21,130
action is actually copying what is

00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:24,669
inside overlays is slash Auto loading

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:28,089
directory that we have in our directory

00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:30,970
next today there was recipe in this case

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,580
we are not specifying any destination so

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,190
whatever is inside

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,950
overlies out loading is going to be copy

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,530
into them into that rescinded to the

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,420
route Emily so if for example with Auto

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:46,480
logging we are copying a system we file

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,690
I have to put a slash USL our last

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:54,700
ending until the file inside out looking

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:57,550
we have to create the full tree so

00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,860
action run actually this is probably the

00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,720
most useful action because everything

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,260
that you cannot do with other actions

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,610
you are going to do with run so you

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:11,470
cannot run a comma or a script inside

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,320
the target file system that you are

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:18,640
creating or in the fig hole very much in

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,040
host if you are running something in

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,600
them in the target file system that you

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,930
are created you will be root so you

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,370
actually can do everything you want if

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,470
you are running it in the effect

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,070
matching host now you are using with

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,670
fake group

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:36,310
you cannot way with him because it's

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,700
like you're on user and you will have a

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:42,910
label a few variables so you will have a

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,470
variable root deal the points to the

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,950
fruit of the target file system that

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,810
you're using you will have artifact deal

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,730
that is a directory with all the fur

00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:54,580
that you're using for for creating your

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,710
own you in my name imagine that will

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,410
point to the image if you have already

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,480
created something and recipe there

00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,180
actually for most of the time is a cell

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,400
the artifact dearest the directory that

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,710
you are using from from the directory

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,890
you are launching the ropes a trolley so

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:15,400
again this is more easy to to see with

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:17,200
an example so yeah again they will

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,490
struggle you are creating a file system

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,570
I'm sorry

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:25,930
as such a route the fifth option is

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:29,080
round inside the the email that you are

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,730
creating so that's what I say such a

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,460
route true because it's being run in

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,710
such a route and with this common we are

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:39,370
creating a list of the packages are

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:42,370
installed given now we want to come to

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:45,010
keep that file after we have finished

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:49,170
running the ropes then we need to copy

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:54,060
it outside that's what the second run

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:57,660
action noise so in this case we we say

00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,550
such a roots Falls and we say I want to

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,130
copy that is fine that is installed in

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,930
the hood ultimate to my heart defective

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:10,230
because they are defective is what I am

00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:13,560
going to keep after the execution a

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,230
second example you also of course can

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,090
use variables in the in the Commons so

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,450
in this case I am just using a common

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,970
life I wanted to to a scrip I will only

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,510
have to pass the the variables were the

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:32,760
parameters to the script and we will

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:36,210
work fine so what if you want to create

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,310
images partition with the ropes that's

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,920
what we do with the last two actions

00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:45,150
that our image image partition assistant

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,730
deploy so with the first one we actually

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,400
create the structures we want to to have

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,830
and the second one most of the time is

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,140
use action and file system deployed and

00:20:52,830 --> 00:21:00,150
will copy will copy the image you have

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:04,530
created in the partitions so example to

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:06,210
finish so here actually I am only

00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:09,750
creating one partition but it's enough

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,880
to to get the idea so I am naming it

00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,890
apparatus because it's an example taken

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,990
from a parities so this is the name this

00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:19,080
is the size this is the kind of

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,750
partition I want to do and well this is

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,720
easier to understand if we check first

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:29,460
partition and the amount points I under

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:32,330
find a root partition using a xp for the

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:36,810
start a thorough person of the 4 Giga

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:39,690
aims at the 100% and then here in Salem

00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:42,180
ok I want to move this in slash in root

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:47,220
this is a root partition and of course I

00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:48,990
want this to boot and and then and the

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,900
second option is pretty messy I'm ok

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:54,800
copy the imagine we have trade before

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,800
into the image partition

00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:04,470
so I have a longest sample here I would

00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:06,870
like to show mostly to to see a big

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:11,990
example so here I have a territory with

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:14,340
all the overlays I am going to use so

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:19,740
see I have another life when you study

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:22,920
the firewall comfy everyone know is the

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,140
thing we're sorry another one for the

00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,740
for the networking and another one for

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,420
for you boot for the options and then I

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,160
have a few scripts I am going to run I

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,160
have a low thing here under the scripts

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:42,270
so let's see the full recipe quickly

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:46,470
because if you follow the presentation

00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:48,720
and look at all the step and is older

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,270
that we have seen before but now making

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,490
an Abbott recipe so here I am saying I

00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:56,550
want to know what this version of the

00:22:53,490 --> 00:23:00,090
finger from from atop and I want my

00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,890
final image it to be cold ladies so here

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,630
I undo loading everything from from

00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:07,590
guitar from the raspberry P repository

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:11,870
it's the first thing I do

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:14,850
then I they will strap a Debian Buster

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:19,380
install all these packages especially

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:22,770
you good and then the kernel when I was

00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,660
with this example I found a problem that

00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,570
is the you would person that was in

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:30,480
Debian Buster didn't boot with for 18

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:32,610
with the kernel for 18 so I have two

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,410
other I scrip don't worry in the new

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,050
good version from the young experimental

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,000
and running that so I am going to open

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:42,060
the scrip here but if you are curious it

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,130
is seen in get tough you can check it

00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:49,470
out later and I have a scrip for setup

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:53,480
being at the user so when I put my money

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:57,560
I will have a user user setting up

00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:00,180
hostname call raspberry where pa3

00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,300
copying the overlay for having network

00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,870
so basically she's copying a sister

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:08,060
unit this is doing what nervous to be

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,490
whatever that means to be done after for

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,920
having a work here this is the same

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:17,590
example done before I am copying the

00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:20,330
film where I am don't love sorry

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,520
removing some files from the final image

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:26,450
it I don't need so I use removing them

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:29,390
from there Here I am copying that you

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:33,460
would files for their Raspberry Pi 3

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:39,230
into boot finger I am having the

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:42,230
configuration for boot and here the

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:48,200
configuration fruit menu and also I want

00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:52,870
to I want to access to my final image by

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,400
the by the using the USB you see the

00:24:52,870 --> 00:25:00,200
serial cable 2 USB so I am adding this

00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:02,960
to the cannot come online yeah yeah I am

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,700
running new boot finale because I called

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,240
the configuration I need install the

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:11,260
package it so I am good to date so my

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,530
match will boot later will you would oh

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:17,300
yeah I am creating two partitions so you

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,330
will see the first one is for the finger

00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:24,860
and I only want it to to be 64 mega

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:26,600
there will be the called finger and then

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,990
I want as a competition that will be the

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,820
root of my system that will start a 64

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,430
mega and will go to the end of the image

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:37,850
and of course I want this to boot

00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:40,370
because where I can I will be in this

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:46,480
case and it's going to be a partition

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:53,840
type of Microsoft DOS with this with

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:56,900
tables to to copy in the image partition

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,700
that we have created or imagine and then

00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,370
basically the last step is are for

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,680
creating the LACMA file with a V map

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,710
tool and for compressing the different

00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,570
imagine if you want to so if you get

00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,850
develops with from the V and right now

00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:14,810
and run this you should have a bootable

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:16,150
image for the Raspberry Pi 3 3 plus is

00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,390
the only device I

00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,300
hardest I have another sample here also

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:26,470
for them for their husband beat three

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:30,100
for the foreman model you could use this

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,570
one is installing uh it's installing a

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:37,720
stretch but you will see is pretty much

00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:39,090
doing almost the same so going back to

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,660
the presentation

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:46,060
so on the future plans so we don't have

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:49,350
any great plans for for the works in the

00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:52,300
future we don't have a roadmap or these

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,850
plans of things were going to do we are

00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,980
basically developing it when we find

00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:00,370
something that we need or when somebody

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:03,100
actually contributed something and there

00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,960
is a file called - to the file but

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,060
actually that name is wrong is no things

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,230
that we want to do is like more license

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,490
would like to like ideas more than true

00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,850
and of course we are continuously

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:18,010
improving the documentation but there is

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:22,660
always something something to improve

00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:24,760
here and there okay so if you want to

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:30,930
know more you have all the relevant

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:34,180
links here in this follow there

00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:36,040
eventually here in go they both the

00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,590
recipes will go the example I showed

00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,240
before if no in the meantime if you want

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,680
to check is a katana

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,030
the post recipes and that's all thank

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,260
you very much for your attention

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,260
if you have any question please

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,980
I will keep I've got one so so that

00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,480
looks great

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,700
as you know I've taken interest in this

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,929
for a while the thing I've always found

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,970
missing and the reason we got

00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:06,890
multi-strap was ability to use two

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,540
repositories to make your image it

00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,000
wasn't entirely clear whether after

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,250
you've made your image we can then use

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,230
apps on another repository or as well

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,130
the multiple sale repositories to

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:20,299
produce all the pieces exactly the

00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,520
bootstrap doesn't do it which is really

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:25,040
annoying so that's one of them seen in

00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,900
there to fire right okay actually if I

00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,940
have time to move it one of the things I

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,250
will implement because it will be super

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,000
useful right now I am afraid that we

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,000
don't have that okay

00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:46,700
do you know hello now replying to

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,530
walkies you can run the bootstrap and

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,150
then you get the minimal Debian system

00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,730
and then you can add the repositories

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,620
you want and they and then you can

00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:57,919
through a script and then you can

00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:04,370
install whatever external packages you

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:05,870
want to install there you have a minimal

00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,270
thing and then you start growing from

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,840
there incrementally adding all your crap

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,840
you want to add

00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:31,290
do you mind coming because yeah thank

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,290
you

00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:46,060
what do you suggest for building your

00:29:39,370 --> 00:30:10,690
own application I mean application to my

00:29:46,060 --> 00:30:12,720
own package it's only for you actually

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,390
is very easy to do because when you are

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,000
sending a package for Damien plenty of

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:23,980
things and then you can set up a

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,180
repository using repo that you only need

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:33,310
to add that repository you can do a

00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:34,690
action copy in the repository and use

00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,120
installing it from there

00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,530
if now if you check my example you can

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,170
do a sign you have them we were you

00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:44,500
would use double you get your very

00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:46,330
emphatically I'm going to it if it's

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,430
only one part Ali you don't need to

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,220
setup a repository you just come to copy

00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:56,710
the package in the image and then do

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:58,360
typically /e install I'm also thinking

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,850
about having a continuous a greater

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,310
system for my application to build a

00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:07,120
package maybe my application use also

00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:17,220
some our dev Debian packages that

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:19,330
depends on so okay and maybe even if and

00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,880
they say if I want to have the

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,890
continuous return to system for my

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:28,050
application to produce the Debian maybe

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:31,180
I can build the image with your tool and

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:34,210
having that at the end they say before

00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:37,570
completing the image downloading the

00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:41,470
sources building the package with a run

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:43,510
action mmm and copying then the dev file

00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:47,120
somewhere and probably somewhere on

00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:53,009
there procedure of some tears

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:58,279
okay you see maybe on some days they are

00:31:53,009 --> 00:32:03,029
adding other packages okay and one more

00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:08,009
you order Damien tools that I'm using

00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:11,610
like yours uses KVM okay mo for to to

00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:13,470
emulate arm mainly I think and do you

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,590
know if there's some plan or something

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:20,429
like that that I can use to to do the

00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:24,330
beers on a VM or something on the cloud

00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:27,149
something like that okay

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:30,149
you use Jenkins but I want you to the

00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:32,610
build machine not a physical Debian

00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:34,889
machine because now I have to to have a

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:43,679
physical double machine because I need

00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:46,619
to I mean and so on okay but I cannot

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:52,619
run it on a cloud VM or something like

00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:54,809
that I thing if if you store with Varian

00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,340
you can try intuitively if no I for

00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:00,769
example you have a clothing store with

00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:04,129
federal you just pulled it okay okay

00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:04,129
okay thank you

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:14,750
I two questions the first one are there

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:20,480
some benefits of using DevOps over make

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:24,290
image creator okay

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,800
and the second question is if you could

00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:30,980
compare this with the there is a tool

00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:35,420
from OpenStack guys it's called

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:38,510
probably disk image builder yeah it does

00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:40,150
I think almost the same a part that they

00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,920
are more focused on the cloud

00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:46,070
Donald embedded machines and couldn't we

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:57,380
achieve pretty the same just using that

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:59,510
one I don't know the size of different

00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,480
tools some of the ice to maintain some

00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:04,790
of the guys didn't know maintain it in

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,340
this there are some of them specified

00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,720
for the clothes and some of them who are

00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:14,300
the big and in store and my wife is

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,310
actually helped I know some of you but

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,030
if you know the two that you mentioned

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,220
sorry

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,530
yeah okay I think that disk image

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,670
builder is really similar they're also

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:27,560
using Yama

00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:30,100
they also have and this layered idea so

00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,020
I think it might be worth checking it

00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:36,160
I'm happy with the roster yes maybe we

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,160
can just roll some ideas

00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:45,020
okay any other question okay Thank You

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,860
Liam much

00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,860
