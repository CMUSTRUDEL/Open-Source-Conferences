	Keynote: Microsoft Participation and the Further Reduction of Patent Risk in the Core of Linux/OSS - Keith Bergelt, Chief Executive Officer, Open Invention Network (OIN)

About Keith Bergelt
Keith Bergelt is the chief executive officer of Open Invention Network (OIN), the collaborative enterprise that enables innovation in open source and an increasingly vibrant ecosystem around Linux. In this capacity he is directly responsible for enabling, influencing and defending the integrity of the Linux ecosystem. Central to the achievement of his goals is the acquisition and transfer of patent rights designed to permit members of the Linux ecosystem to operate free of the threat of assertion and litigation from those whose business models are antithetical to innovation and global economic growth in information technology and computing.
Prior to joining the Open Invention Network, Mr. Bergelt served as president and CEO of two Hedge Funds – Paradox Capital and IPI – formed to unlock the considerable asset value of patents, trademarks and copyrights in middle market companies. Paradox and IPI were the first Funds of their kind to offer specialty lending products supported exclusively by intellectual property. Driven by Mr. Bergelt’s creativity and entrepreneurial approach, these funds enabled the emergence of patents, trademarks and copyrights as a viable source of collateral in asset-based loans, forever reshaping the emerging IP Finance landscape.
During Mr. Bergelt’s stewardship of these IP-based lending activities, he raised more than $300 million dollars and financed portfolio companies of private equity firms including Texas Pacific Group, Kelso & Co., JH Whitney, Weston Presidio, Goode Partners, Palladium Capital and Castanea Partners, among others.
Previously, Mr. Bergelt served as a senior advisor to the technology investment division at Texas Pacific Group. He also headed business development, intellectual property and licensing for the Kelso & Company portfolio company Cambridge Display Technology in the United Kingdom. Additionally, he established and served as General Manager of the Strategic Intellectual Asset Management business unit at Motorola Corporation and served as Motorola’s director of Technology Strategy.
Mr. Bergelt was a co-founder of the Intellectual Property Advisory Practice within the Electronics and Telecommunications Industry group at SRI Consulting in Menlo Park, California.
Prior to his extensive private sector experience, Mr. Bergelt served for twelve years as a diplomat with postings at the United Nations in NY and the American Embassy in Tokyo, Japan where he was involved in the negotiation of IP rights protection in Asia.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
it's a pleasure to be here I think three

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,779
years ago we were in Dublin together and

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,980
Jim and I shared a Guinness toast on

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:13,530
stage to celebrate 10 years of Vaughn's

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,859
existence and since then we've continued

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,810
to grow and it I'm always reminded it

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,990
when I come to an LF event of a

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,119
conversation that Jim and I had just

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,010
about ten and a half years ago his

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,390
daughter had yet to be born I met his

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,150
wife that day and it was my first

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,390
face-to-face meeting with Jim and he

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,660
talked about his ambition of of really

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,340
being able to create a series of

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,710
projects and I don't think at that point

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,300
you know he could have possibly

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,980
conceptualized just how this community

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,629
has grown and just how the lft has

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,120
become a fostering agent and

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,149
professional management organization to

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,250
be able to help nurture projects like

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,559
which Julie just described very

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,460
important project related to the energy

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,739
sector globally and Jim talked about the

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,899
the idea the vision of having these

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,760
projects and most of them you know as a

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,130
very frank conversation we talked about

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,380
what licences they'd be done under how

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,060
they would be administered what kind of

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,830
commitment what kind of resourcing it

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,780
would take it was really the

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,960
architecture of the transformation of

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,729
the LF from ten and a half years ago

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,030
through to today and and obviously it

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,159
has great momentum going forward and and

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,009
we talked about how if you were doing

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,049
these these projects largely on

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,720
permissive licenses which have

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,729
relatively weak intellectual property

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,729
protection components related to patents

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,710
that we would need to partner up that we

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,280
would need to live in the slipstream of

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,840
what the LF was creating and and really

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,360
we've we've done that

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,399
from that date onward it helped me

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,549
actually that session because it was I

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,229
think I'd probably been in my in the CEO

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,969
role for two or three months at that

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,219
point and was really just getting my

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,259
feet wet and understanding the community

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,750
doing a lot of outreach talking with a

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,070
lot of people whether it was the you

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,039
know the Richard Stallman's of the

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,340
Worlds or the talking to the fsfe in

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,440
Europe SFL see in this in the States and

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,630
really understanding how

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,970
I could have an impact on how oen could

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,130
be transformative what its role would be

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,350
I mean there are stars and water

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,540
carriers in this world and and I've

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,300
always viewed that once I understood

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,860
from that conceptualization discussion

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,530
with Jim and kind of understanding the

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,540
ambition of the LF that the that oh ions

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,640
best position is as a water carrier

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,530
where the companies that you work for

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,210
and many thousands of other companies

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,550
not even represented in this hall today

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,980
are the stars because they're investing

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,170
billions of dollars in in open source

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,690
code they're investing in technology

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,210
development they're investing in new new

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,280
pathways to be able to create a more

00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,900
effective way of collaboratively

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,030
developing technology to drive

00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,040
innovation in ways that we couldn't have

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,160
even conceptualized 30 or 40 years ago

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,410
and and really out of that those

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,310
earliest discussions I recognize that we

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:11,100
were going to need to develop a vehicle

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,890
to be able to protect what was

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,020
inevitable which is the the world moving

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,950
toward open-source in a very profound

00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:23,190
and insignificant way I'm here today to

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,200
talk about some element of manifest

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,070
destiny probably and I've used this term

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,860
with Microsoft but when I first came

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,900
into my role there's a history and and

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,010
I'd rather than go into the history I'd

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,739
prefer to talk about the future but

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,200
Microsoft's participation in oin and

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,230
agreeing to to support patent

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,550
non-aggression and core of Linux

00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,190
represents a sea change and I've gotten

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,900
so many notes and from many of you in

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,250
the audience and and others that I've

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,030
had the chance to meet and get to know

00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,540
over the years congratulating me on this

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,820
activity and and what I would do would

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,209
do is congratulate Microsoft on facing

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:10,080
the inevitability of of the world as it

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:13,260
is versus the world as as a former CEO

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,209
would and former CEOs of Microsoft would

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:20,120
like to have have thought it would be

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:22,350
would would / - from the late 90s onward

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,140
but the world has changed and you've

00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,180
changed the world and and I think that's

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,280
that's a testament

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,080
Oh Ian's what oin has accomplished is a

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,169
testament to the growth of this

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,410
community that the LF is fostered and

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,810
the realization of every company sitting

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,850
here and so many other companies of the

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,229
importance of open-source to their own

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,880
competitiveness I think for a lot of

00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,880
people they ask the question you know

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,580
what really just happened we've had many

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,110
many articles published by different

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,410
journals whether they be industry

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:03,000
journals or fortune fortune online Yahoo

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:05,250
News many other media outlets ZDNet what

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,289
happened how it happened and and why it

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,090
happened I think are critical questions

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:11,580
and I wanted to kind of delve into this

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,229
to kind of demystify what what actually

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,789
has happened and what Microsoft is

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:19,620
committed to the press release we put

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,990
out basically talks about the support

00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,789
for innovation and how they've agreed at

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,949
the core of Linux all the core

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:28,050
technology which we include in something

00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,599
called the Linux system which is Linux

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,630
kernel code plus adjacent open source

00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:35,639
code that's really central to many of

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,210
the projects that that Linux Foundation

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:43,159
has authored and managed or and projects

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,900
such as OpenStack Apache and many others

00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:48,380
the problem I picked out these these

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,090
headlines because they probably

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,789
characterized the perceptions that that

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,159
are moving in the last 10 days since the

00:05:53,789 --> 00:06:00,270
announcement and the press release have

00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:02,909
really started to circulate the you know

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:06,300
bears repeating Microsoft assigned the O

00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:09,120
and licensed what have they done yes you

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,639
know it's it's true because for so many

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,490
people for so long it's been viewed that

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,409
Microsoft has been through its own

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,320
behaviors and rhetoric has allowed

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,909
itself to be villainized but it's

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,090
evolving and that's why this is a

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:29,039
perfect forum with the the theme of this

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:32,840
this this event around the evolution of

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,000
open-source no company has come further

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,139
from being the most successful

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,270
proprietary software company in the

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,920
history of the world to now being a

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,260
company that recognizes

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,210
it's need for interdependence its need

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,940
to participate collaboratively with

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,100
others in the world lest it fall behind

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,650
less did not have the ability to

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:58,470
effectively offer solutions that people

00:06:52,650 --> 00:07:03,600
want to buy the why of it is really

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:05,760
about you if this community if the LF if

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,300
other project management organizations

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,240
were not successful in generating

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,100
billions of lines of code and getting

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,050
participation from the best and the

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,650
brightest people around the world to be

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,080
able to code and contribute to projects

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,420
then we would not exist we would have no

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,850
reason to exist we'd still have the 31

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,650
licensees that that when I came into oh

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,930
I in after the first three years of its

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,270
operation we had instead of the twenty

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,580
eight hundred plus that we have now and

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,220
a hundred of which have joined just in

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,580
the last five working days since the

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,340
announcement of the Microsoft license

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,770
and so it's the community on which we

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,370
stand in the community on which we are

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:53,430
building our platform I said in Dublin

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,710
three years ago that we stand on the

00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:00,420
shoulders of those who have who have

00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:03,690
pioneered open source legal issues that

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:08,160
have been fighting in Europe in the u.s.

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,630
in Asia to be able to support freedom of

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,500
action and freedom to operate an

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:17,070
ultimately choice if you think about

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,560
this this is not this may look like

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,540
something that's very sudden but if you

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:27,270
look at this this piece that was

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:29,250
actually presented ten years ago to at

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,160
UCLA's Business School the Anderson

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:35,370
School of Business there have been many

00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,229
many people that had been pushing on the

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,460
the rudder of that that have felt like

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,520
they've been pushing on the rudder of

00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,979
the Titanic inside Microsoft some of

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,660
whom are here today to be able to drive

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,990
change to be able to drive a new

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,310
awareness and that awareness takes time

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,860
when you're especially when you're

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,779
coming from where they've come from

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,620
but that change

00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:00,560
is not over it's merely midstream but

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,550
what an important one important

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,740
manifestation of that change is the

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,839
recognition that patents and the and

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,779
control are not the vehicle to be able

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,180
to enjoy competitiveness in a

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:14,939
competitive situation and to be able to

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,189
tap into creativity if you want to hire

00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:19,259
the best people then you you basically

00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:22,800
recognize the code of conduct that they

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:25,079
accept and I think it's a it's

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,910
significant that people ask me well how

00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,360
long has this been going on and I've

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,730
been talking to Microsoft for nine years

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,680
and some conversations have been cordial

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,689
some not so much

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,730
we've agreed to disagree on certain

00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:44,370
things and we've looked for areas where

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:46,230
we had common interests and for for the

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,449
last three years we've been in active

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,610
productive dialogue around the new

00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:52,410
realities these realities that I'm

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,749
describing the ones that Jim and Shirley

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,059
have described as well about about the

00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:59,250
new world order the whole idea of this

00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:02,160
mode in this modality of collaborative

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,439
development that one plus one plus one

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,750
doesn't equal three @ equals six or 10

00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:09,750
or 20 when we bring smart creative

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,939
people to to come together to solve

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,970
technical challenges to create new

00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:17,399
innovation and this partnership that

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,019
we've had from from really my first

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,019
face-to-face meeting with Jim that I

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:26,939
described a short while ago has really

00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:29,279
been been been profoundly important to I

00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:31,139
believe than the the fact that we've had

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,129
precious little litigation in the

00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:36,629
community

00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:41,939
oay n is a is a blip on the screen and

00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:44,309
it's a unicorn to think that some of the

00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:47,089
most patent centric companies in the

00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:50,009
world like IBM and Sony and Philips

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:55,259
would come together with sousei and Red

00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:57,870
Hat NEC and ultimately with others who

00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,459
came in like Google and Toyota to put

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,649
real capital out to serve a

00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:04,319
paternalistic role to be able to support

00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:06,569
this modality to protect this way of

00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,250
creating value in the new economy is

00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:10,680
somewhat amazing and to have the head

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,110
the foresight to create its create

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,980
something that would appeal to those who

00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,930
on one hand or completely anti software

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,050
patent maybe anti patent across the

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,060
board to those who are have grown their

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,650
businesses around the idea that that

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,120
patents are actually relevant to

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:31,950
innovation fortunately I don't have to

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,740
pander to one community or another I

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:37,200
basically present this elegant solution

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,270
that was developed by twenty-three

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,200
lawyers thirteen years ago

00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:45,990
fourteen years ago now and and it has

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,690
broad appeal and it has broad appeal

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,910
because of growth because of you because

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,370
you're out there and thousands like you

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,460
are out there participating and creating

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,990
a community and if if you were not out

00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,420
there if open-source were not relevant

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,880
Microsoft would not be in a position

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,250
where it's exposing its 60,000 patent

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,110
and application portfolio to a cross

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,620
license based on what the Linux system

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,540
is this whole idea of legal

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,730
collaboration that parallels technical

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,830
collaboration is is an idea that Jim and

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,290
I forged ten years ago and this

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,150
partnership is one that we live as I

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,490
said in the slipstream of every project

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:26,250
that you'll see listed every project

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,980
that that is here and and those that

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,320
don't fit on the page managed by the

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,180
Linux Foundation and others we live in

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,900
the slipstream of those projects we take

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,450
common code that's used in many projects

00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:41,880
we take also project specific code and

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,500
we bring it in have it evaluated we do

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,720
outreach to the community to make sure

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,850
this code is representative of what the

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,040
core of Linux is and we create a no

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,500
patent no-fly zone around it it's not a

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,690
terribly complex concept which is why

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,830
when people dig in look at it they

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:03,180
ultimately see it as valuable the how of

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:05,490
this our mission is is really simple

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,400
it's to enable choice if you looked at

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,140
the the the title of the slide the

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,110
Microsoft slide that was presented at

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:16,709
UCLA ten years ago it's really about

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,230
choice the the the developers coders the

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:21,330
lead lead developers inside Microsoft at

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,880
that time through today have understood

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,950
that

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,960
every organization developers and coders

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,060
have understood that and really what

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,730
we're trying to do is again create a

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,800
patent no-fly zone that supports uptake

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,790
one of the things that would would have

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,040
have really created a look at the the

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,900
auto industry look at banking that the

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,180
people that are joining the hyper ledger

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,120
project these are industries that have

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,700
notoriously been risk-averse when it

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,770
comes to patent issues would they have

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,200
actually embraced these significant

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,750
projects ten years ago fifteen years ago

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,760
20 years ago probably not but it's a

00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,130
time and place thing where the community

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,170
is evolved risk mitigation has evolved

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,730
to the point where it was acceptable for

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,240
these companies to participate

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,630
oh I ends membership includes these

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,780
companies that have as I said funded oin

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,400
we have over 2,800 participants we've

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,930
invested a hundred million dollars in

00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,450
patents that we provide a royalty-free

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,720
license to to be able to enable and

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:26,230
encourage participation in the community

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,820
the cost is zero this is just a sample

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,620
of some of the companies that are

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,070
participating from a whole variety of

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,140
industries and it's a global solution if

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,000
this is not about an American driven

00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,070
solution it's increasingly becoming

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,810
Asian because that's where more and more

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,880
of the participants are coming from as

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,650
the LF has done a great job of bringing

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,310
in more and more participants to their

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:50,110
projects and so our representation

00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,210
reflects where Linux is and where it's

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,280
going China is a very important

00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,020
environment for us one that we measure

00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,720
against Japan which is really the

00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,270
foundation in Asia of open-source

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,890
adoption and we keep track of the of

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,780
this because it's a measure of how well

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,120
we're doing in terms of our global

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,790
mission the bottom line is companies

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,220
that don't participate in oin are doing

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,020
so for one reason because they want to

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,390
reserve the right to sue on core Linux

00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,880
there's no other explanation that's a

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,430
legitimate characterization of why you

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,290
wouldn't and so I'd encourage those who

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,780
are present to talk to your company

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,420
inside your companies to talk to your IP

00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:31,150
directors your legal teams to encourage

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,040
participation because we are

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,870
increasingly moving toward a time when

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,440
this is the community and the

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,930
movement is around the notion of the

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,410
elegance of of kind of this

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,480
collaborative development model that's

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,500
self-organizing it's also

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,110
self-regulating and I think more and

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,200
more we're people are recognizing as

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:57,460
Microsoft has that talent is attracted

00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:01,120
to two behaviors two norms and to an

00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:04,900
ability to articulate a clear vision for

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,970
for the for a company if you want to

00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,010
bring people in then you have to adhere

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,510
to a code of conduct and our license is

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,370
really nothing much more than that

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,140
it's a code of conduct and a set of

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,440
norms that are established as to how you

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:19,980
deal in a world that that where we've

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,140
inherited a lot of proprietary

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,210
technology we've inherited a patent

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,010
system rather than pretend that it

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,380
doesn't exist we have to deal with what

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,930
we find make the best of it and carve

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,120
out a space for projects like like those

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:39,970
at the LF and others have have launched

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:42,360
to flourish thank you very much thank

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,360
