	Grabbing Audio and Video on a Board Farm - Krzysztof Opasiak, Samsung R&D Institute Poland

 Running a test lab usually has two purposes: automated tests and sharing boards among developers. For many use cases accessing a board over serial console and being able to boot a custom kernel is enough. But what if you develop multimedia drivers or apps and their QA requires grabbing audio and video output from your board?

Krzysztof starts his story with a gentle introduction to MuxPi: open hardware board which allows unified remote access to (almost) any Single Board Computer. The most important features and limitations of this board are presented in this part. Next, he shows how to extend it with audio and video capture capabilities using a cheap ($30) HDMI extender and provide this stream to remote machine. Then the story goes to human input emulation and integrating whole solution into single convenient open source app. Finally there is Q&A session and hopefully some discussion.
