Description: 
	Keynote: Exceeding Diversity and Inclusion Goals to Fuel Open Source Growth - Johanna Koester, Program Director of Developer Technology and Advocacy, IBM

Diversity and inclusion are more than a checkbox; it’s fuel for open source community growth and success. While we have seen great progress for diversity in the form of center stage presentations and focused meetings at most tech events, the reality is that there is still more to be done drive effective inclusivity of those diversity groups.

Through the stories of successful open source contributors from under-represented groups, Johanna’s keynote will celebrate the best practices that have enabled the success of these individuals and then provide recommendations to further drive inclusion in any technology community. Open source communities have shown the world that when we bring together members of multiple companies and diverse backgrounds, we can achieve far more than working apart. It’s for that reason that open source communities today have a great responsibility to continue advancements for inclusion not only to fuel their own success but more importantly to model the benefits of inclusion to the world.

hello everybody two of my favorite

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,240
topics

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,099
no kidding or open source and diversity

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,920
so I can't tell you how thrilled I am to

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,969
be on this stage talking about those two

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,680
topics together part of the reason I

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,570
feel this way is from the first day I

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,939
was involved in open source communities

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,560
I just loved it the whole idea that all

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,689
of us are coming together all of you

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,730
from different companies from around the

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,429
world to solve problems together

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,900
regardless to your companies is just a

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,399
beautiful model and then you're creating

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,739
something that's freely downloadable I

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,579
think it's fantastic so I just loved it

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,190
from the beginning

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,040
so for me I think there's no better

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,750
place to work on diversity and inclusion

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,660
and model this for the world

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,910
I think it's really profoundly important

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,500
this is the great place to do this so

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,110
through my talk today I hope you can

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,500
walk away some ideas some best practices

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,030
it's not completely comprehensive

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,100
because there are so many ways to

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,600
approach inclusion I really encourage

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,510
you to go to some of the diversity

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,650
summit track while you're here because

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,600
all the people who are running those

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,000
programs are saying similar but even

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,810
deeper topics things that you can become

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,159
involved with so I don't want to make

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,840
this all about data but I think it's

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,340
really important to start with some data

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,810
and there are a lot of studies to

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,950
mention this yesterday there are a lot

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,310
of studies on the importance of

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,049
diversity and I'd like to say we all

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,070
should do it from from the perspective

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,240
of it's the right thing to do but

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,180
there's some really great business sense

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,540
reasons to do this so a study from

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,280
McKinsey and company this year did a

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,740
study of companies in the top quartile

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,720
so companies in the top quartile of

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,110
gender diversity in their executive

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,329
leadership they were 21% more likely to

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,950
have above average profits when you

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,130
increase the diversity to to all

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,380
diversity groups it goes up to 33% more

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,530
likely to have above average profits

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,880
this makes business sense so if it's not

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,710
enough to do it for the right reasons

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,219
it's important to do it from a business

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,719
perspective now on the other hand we

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,460
have a long way to go I think everyone

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,459
realizes that from a diversity

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,700
perspective there's a lot a lot of

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,310
improvement one of the studies and some

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,920
people reference this study yesterday

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,990
wired did a magazine Wired magazine did

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,810
an article and it referenced a github

00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,120
survey taken last year and a 5500

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,569
respondents only 3% we're women

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,770
and this is a pretty dismal number so we

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,690
have a lot of work to do

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,370
I just wanted to present those as two

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,880
data points for what we're working on

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,069
now while diversity is very easy to

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,540
measure as a percentage the way to get

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,160
there is through inclusion and this is

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,650
hard to measure these are the softer

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,190
skills the softer sciences this is about

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,700
having empathy about being subjective

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,560
being authentically yourself and it's a

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,959
culture thing so it's it's very hard to

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,540
measure this so again I want to give you

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,430
some ideas in this talk about what we

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,200
can do to improve the culture witching

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,650
helps people feel more included and then

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,209
those diversity numbers will go up I'm

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,280
gonna start with my own story I actually

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,690
want to profile some other women that I

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,190
work with to give you some best

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,600
practices but I figured you need to know

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,519
a little bit about me and I have a

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,040
couple of inclusion stories to share

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,650
with all of you I'm gonna go all the way

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,239
back to when I was a kid and not just

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,250
because my mom sitting in the room but

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,310
when I was a kid my parents instilled me

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,290
with some really basic values of I can

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,049
do anything you know walk into that room

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,700
decide what you want to do and feel

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,110
empowered feel that you can do this and

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,930
that's that's so important so it really

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,370
does start when we're young with our

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,680
children and also telling our children

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,260
to include others so I just want to

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,700
mention that but my next step I'm going

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,930
to talk about high school and the reason

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,480
I want to bring up high school is

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,030
because I took my first computer science

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,950
class in high school and I just I loved

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,549
it it just appealed to me I was already

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,049
a math person I love the problem solving

00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,850
accessibility to technology at an early

00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,790
age is really important because this is

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:05,180
before we have any bias about what we

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,260
think we can or cannot achieve so from

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,810
there

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,470
yes University of Edinburgh I did a year

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,030
in college in my junior year absolutely

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,100
loved it I don't have a particular

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,410
inclusion story except that I did feel

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,109
very included so good job people of

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,270
Scotland it was a great experience

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,350
my base school was Tulane University and

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,730
I do want to tell a story about Tulane

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,130
that the head of the computer science

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,750
department there was a woman and I'll

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,030
tell you at the time I didn't think much

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,890
about it I just felt like this is this

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,890
is normal my context growing up was I'm

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,660
capable of anything but in hindsight how

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,940
powerful was that to have a woman

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,430
leading my department to see myself in

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,490
leadership so diversity and our

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,560
leadership's is so so important from

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,240
there I went to work at IBM I've been an

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,640
IBM since then it's been a great

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,340
experience iBM is known for their values

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,590
we have a great culture we are very

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,570
inclusive but the story I want to talk

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,190
about an IBM is not the one you might

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,050
think this my story is not so much about

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,480
a woman in tech because I have to say

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,060
I've had some really great opportunities

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,220
but about 16 years ago I decided to go

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,250
part-time work of reduced our schedule

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,110
and to me this was my first inclusion

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,910
challenge because I'll tell you once you

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,220
work a reduced our schedule people form

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,980
a bias about how committed you are or

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,700
how available you are and it's simply

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,220
not the case

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,660
so throughout the talk I just want you

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,460
to think about there are lots of forms

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,500
of diversity it's not always gender it's

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,610
not always sexual orientation it's not

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,600
always race there are lots of factors so

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,300
really important to include people who

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,370
work in different types of schedules how

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,170
we work

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,030
so my first open source experience was

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,150
with OpenStack when IBM was a founder of

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,800
the foundation and the very first event

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,120
that I went to again I just loved it the

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,180
idea of all the developers coming

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,370
together to work on problems to solve in

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,890
particular at that first event there was

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,360
a women's breakfast and I thought well

00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,150
I'll go I don't know a lot of people

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,710
here so went to the breakfast met a lot

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,410
of new friends met the leaders of

00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,760
OpenStack because they were there and

00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,740
what a wonderfully inclusive way to

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,780
start an event I only knew my own

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,730
colleagues from my company at the event

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,650
but after that breakfast I had a lot of

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,810
new friends and when you have that level

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,580
of camaraderie and friendship you're

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,680
gonna feel more included when you go to

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,560
your - the rest of the event so that was

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,300
they said the bar pretty high and from

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,790
there I went to work on Cloud Foundry

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,320
foundation and a number of other

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,850
foundations as Jim mentioned but I do

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,430
want to call it Cloud Foundry because

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,890
when we were part of helping start the

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,000
Cloud Foundry Foundation I really loved

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,770
that the leaders of

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,930
Foundation said we'd like to make sure

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,460
we are highly diverse and inclusive what

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,830
can we do they asked those of us who are

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,780
at the table to help start what should

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,270
we do and a lot of us pointed to

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,800
OpenStack they by then had started the

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,900
women of OpenStack and also other

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,300
diversity initiatives other inclusive

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,740
groups and and said meet with them and

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,090
understand what they're doing and Cloud

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,650
Foundry is benefit they did the same

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,870
things they have a lot of the programs

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,990
whether it's women's breakfasts or

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,210
networking presentations panels anything

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,560
that gives us knowledge about what we

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,860
can do to empower ourselves in these

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,510
communities so enough about me I really

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,160
want to talk about the stars of the show

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,960
which are three colleagues of mine that

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,030
I've worked with for years now and I

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,650
really think very highly of them I want

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,150
this to be a positive story sometimes

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,400
the diversity inclusion talks can be

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,200
quite negative and I want to focus on

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,540
what's worked for them and help teach

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,190
you a little bit about that so I'm gonna

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,930
start with swetha who's right there

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,310
you might want to meet swetha while

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,320
you're here she'll probably be the booth

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,760
at some point I met her a couple of

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,730
years ago when I was working in the

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,890
Cloud Foundry foundation and she was

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,120
just I just had a lot of energy about

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,790
cloud founder he had a great experience

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,260
and we talked some about that and based

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,460
on her experience at Cloud Foundry she

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,110
went on to work on the hyper ledger

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,070
project where she's currently working on

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:58,380
the etherium integration and so just

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,450
like I did with the other women I said

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,740
well what worked for you what was a good

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,340
experience and what more do we have to

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,380
do so Cloud Foundry again from from a

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,669
very positive perspective she had the

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,169
opportunity to work on lots of different

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,060
projects I think that's a great thing

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,620
when you're when you feel included when

00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,110
you can get access to many different

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,390
types of Technology and projects also

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,640
Cloud Foundry has this concept of paired

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,380
programming so when you start

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,479
immediately you have a partner that

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,130
you're working with and someone who

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,830
helps you along the way this is a

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,650
mentoring type situation this is a great

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,030
way to feel included and the other thing

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,640
she told me about I loved is she had a

00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,349
mentor not only in IBM so having mentors

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,120
in your own company is helpful but

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,669
having mentors in the foundation she had

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,430
someone who checked on or reasoning

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,250
relatively frequently and say how are

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,650
you doing can I help you

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,350
what do you need this is a relatively

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,080
simple concept but it's so helpful when

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,370
you're new to a community and so she was

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,500
very successful there and then that

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,380
helped launch her into the hyperlink

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,960
project and she's doing quite well so I

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,250
said but what else do we need to do what

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,080
else can we do to make communities more

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,840
inclusive and there was some interesting

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,280
points because our conversation was not

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,660
as much about being a woman in

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,340
technology it was about some of these

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:17,240
other characteristics that make up us

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:20,090
and other individuals in the room so one

00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,330
of it was making sure you take time to

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,350
prompt the quieter people in the room

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,720
you've probably seen them they probably

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,610
come to your projects those quiet people

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,290
sometimes have a lot to offer I'm not

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,940
saying drag it out of them but offer

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,760
them the chance give them the prompt and

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,710
ask for their input it's been quite some

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,150
people just need that permission to

00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,540
speak before they're they're gonna

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,680
contribute the other interesting thing

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,080
we talked about that I haven't thought

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,820
about because I am in the east coast of

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,310
the US and and I have to say sometimes

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,589
were a little centric on East Coast time

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,400
for meetings is and cheese on the west

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:57,020
coast is time zone inclusiveness make

00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,570
sure in your working groups is you meet

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,190
with people all over the world change

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,200
the times that you're meeting give that

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,760
person on the west coast or in China the

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,230
opportunity to participate in the

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,550
meeting during their normal business

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,589
hours because that's when you feel your

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,900
best and you'll contribute your best so

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:15,080
time zone inclusiveness is really very

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,640
important and the one I the last one I

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,680
really liked is it's very important is

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,730
avoiding the back rooms I mean those of

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,350
us who've been in communities a long

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,660
time it's really easy to just talk with

00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,600
your colleagues and have the back room

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,250
chatter but it's very excluding to other

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,510
people who might be new so it's really

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,910
important to have discussions and the

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,330
open have things well documented so

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:38,780
anyone new can really feel comfortable

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:40,880
contributing so next I want to talk

00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,320
about Miriam I met Miriam several years

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,260
ago working in the OpenStack community

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,760
and she had a great experience she went

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,430
on to be a core contributor for the

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,100
truth project and after that she went to

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,850
work for went to work at the Kafka

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,620
community and I talked to her and the

00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,310
same same kind of questions what worked

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,860
well for you what else can we do

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,019
and she had again we had both had great

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,300
experience at OpenStack the women of

00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,490
OpenStack became more organized we had

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,490
again breakfast we had networking we had

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,769
panel discussions in education very

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,199
structured program and this helped

00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,089
people like Miriam quite a lot because

00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:20,309
you got to know people you had people

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,499
who can help you so as she put it

00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:25,050
communities within communities was a

00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:26,999
really important takeaway and then as I

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,980
said well what else can we do she made

00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,180
the point that and I think that you

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,620
should all take away is that it

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,930
shouldn't just this isn't always about

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,949
gender or against sexual orientation or

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,110
race it

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:38,819
we need communities for everyone to feel

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,009
included so we should always think about

00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:43,230
these communities within communities

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,269
that we can form to help anybody from

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,149
various backgrounds feel comfortable and

00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:49,379
with the people they want to be with and

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,059
then the last thing that she I really

00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,370
liked that she said because it's quite

00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,110
simple is make sure you provide

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,720
responses and feedback to those

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,480
newcomers you know if you're a newcomer

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,100
and you you do contribute but you don't

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,569
get the feedback what positive or

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,149
negative just something that helps guide

00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,709
you you're not going to feel included so

00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:10,110
just something as simple as making sure

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:12,990
when when that newcomer has questions or

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,189
does submit make sure that you give them

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,779
the feedback that they're looking for

00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,889
they'll feel included and then they'll

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:21,540
contribute more so last but certainly

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,670
not least I want to talk about Daisy

00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,620
I've probably known Daisy the longest we

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,019
worked also in the OpenStack foundation

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,170
together and she has since gone on to

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,279
work in the open west community and

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,860
she's proud and I know we're all very

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:36,689
proud of her that she's the founder and

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,309
the first PTL of the

00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,069
internationalization project did

00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:43,050
OpenStack this is by definition very

00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:44,939
inclusive so she has a project that's

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,009
all about making OpenStack accessible to

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:50,490
the world very proud of her for that

00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:54,059
accomplishment so when I talked to her

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:55,740
about what's worked well again women of

00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,569
OpenStack played a big role but when we

00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,019
talked about what more mean needs to be

00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:01,139
done

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,769
it was interesting this time zone issue

00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,269
came up once again if she's in China and

00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:07,740
often people in China end up with the

00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,540
really short end of the stick on this in

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,250
the middle of the night so we talked

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,830
about that time zone inclusiveness is

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,800
really important

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,940
seeing diversity in your leadership you

00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,530
know I mentioned this as part of my

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,240
story it really is important to have the

00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,100
diversity in the leadership so that we

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,400
can see ourselves and know what's

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:30,050
possible and feel welcome and then the

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:33,380
the last thing is bottom line offer some

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:35,810
help offer some kindness offer advice to

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,450
those newcomers you know make sure again

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,760
offer them their prompts to help them

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,500
feel welcome so again there's not a lot

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,150
of rocket science here to help people

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,530
feel included and it's not always just

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,990
about being a woman or a

00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,180
fill-in-the-blank underrepresented group

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,920
it's about including people and these

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:57,530
simple acts can help people feel more

00:13:51,920 --> 00:14:00,200
included so as I start to wrap up here

00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,460
for you I hope that one of the things

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,680
you take away is there's so many

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:06,170
elements to diversity it's not just

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,900
about gender and orientation and race

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,970
their therapy aspects up here that I

00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,770
didn't even talk about I recently went

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,120
to a diversity talk where there was

00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,640
someone who used to be in the military

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,990
and they were talking about how how hard

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,430
it can be to feel included because they

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,140
just have a different way of speaking

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,700
and acting so there are lots of

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,710
different diversity groups I just ask

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,200
that you open your mind to all the

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,540
groups that we need to make sure that we

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,400
bring into our population in communities

00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,020
and then I talked about several ideas

00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,820
there's a lot that our communities can

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,980
do the foundations can do they can offer

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,210
communities and networking and summits

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,970
like they do and these are really

00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,920
important and very much encouraged but I

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,690
really hope that you take away one or

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,210
even two ideas of something that you can

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:53,000
do starting today these are really

00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:55,130
simple acts again it's giving prompts to

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,480
the quiet person there in the room it's

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,570
being sensitive to other people's

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,040
backgrounds it's apologizing if you step

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,540
over the line we talked about yesterday

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,420
and one of the diversity talks that you

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,000
might make mistakes but you can

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,550
apologize and move on so I just ask that

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,320
you take one or two of these ideas and

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:17,090
start practicing them today and we'll

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,550
all together move the needle so I'm

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,740
getting to the end here I want to see if

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,990
you'd like to test your inclusion skills

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,139
so I've hopefully you already knew

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,209
something come in I've

00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,160
you a couple more ideas so I set up this

00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,569
challenge on the IBM coder community I'm

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,980
really proud of this worked with some

00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:33,839
colleagues and there are three

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,359
challenges there one challenge I just

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,730
asked you to submit one of your best

00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:40,470
practices ideas another one is read the

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,149
Linux Foundation event code of conduct

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,009
which hopefully you already did before

00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,779
you came here but you can test there's a

00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,939
little little quiz so you can test your

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,699
knowledge on that and then the third I'm

00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:53,129
really excited about IBM launch this - s

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,799
360 open source project Eric was talking

00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:57,929
about it earlier it reduces bias and

00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,579
machine learning this is so important we

00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:01,290
need to do this in our real lives but

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,540
it's also about the technology to reduce

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,489
bias as well so if you go to that

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,769
challenge you can download the code try

00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:10,199
it yourself and take a little quiz and

00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,819
hopefully earn yourself a badge so I

00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,339
encourage you to go try it's very fun

00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:18,359
and I look forward to your feedback on

00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:21,149
your ideas for best practices and so

00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:23,669
I've given you a lot of ideas and bottom

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,319
line I would just suggest that if you've

00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,790
forgotten everything that I said if you

00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,459
forgot everything in the diversity track

00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,779
always lead with kindness it will get

00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:32,309
you there I know it's not enough to

00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,919
always be nice we need to be sensitive

00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:36,239
to backgrounds but if all else fails

00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,369
just be kind to those in the room and

00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,989
sensitive so thank you for the time

00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:41,669
thank you Lenox foundation again for

00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:42,569
giving me this opportunity to talk about

00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:49,999
this important topic

00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:49,999
