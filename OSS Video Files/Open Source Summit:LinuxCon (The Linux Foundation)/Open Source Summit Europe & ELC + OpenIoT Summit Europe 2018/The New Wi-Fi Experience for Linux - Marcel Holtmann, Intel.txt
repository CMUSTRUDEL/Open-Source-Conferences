	The New Wi-Fi Experience for Linux - Marcel Holtmann, Intel

With the introduction of the open source wireless daemon iwd, the Wi-Fi experience for Linux has changed. It became necessary to replace wpa_supplicant and create a complete system for managing Wi-Fi for Linux in a single place. Almost 2 years later iwd has succeed and implemented features and functionality that was previously not available on Linux. This presentation focuses on the recent development and how iwd has been integrated into existing platforms using NetworkManager and ConnMan or how it fits into ChromeOS. With iwd the seamless and fast roaming is no longer something that has only been seen on non-Linux platforms. It has kept up with recent 802.11 standard development and Wi-Fi Alliance updates. The development of iwd led to new kernel interfaces to help improve the user experience and simplify Wi-Fi for Linux.
