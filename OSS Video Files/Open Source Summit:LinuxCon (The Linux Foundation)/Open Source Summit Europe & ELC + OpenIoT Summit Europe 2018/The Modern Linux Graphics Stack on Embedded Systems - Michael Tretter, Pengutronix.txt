	The Modern Linux Graphics Stack on Embedded Systems - Michael Tretter, Pengutronix

Wayland advances to replace X as the goto windowing system in Linux, many applications and graphic toolkits are rapidly improving their Wayland support. Recent additions to the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM), e.g., atomic modeset and format modifiers, allow compositors to make smarter decisions how to utilize the hardware. This is critical for embedded systems, as these decisions affect the graphics performance and power usage. Therefore, a Wayland compositor becomes a compelling choice for building embedded systems that feature any graphical user interface.

Michael will walk through the Linux graphics stack from Kernel drivers to applications to show the components of the modern Linux graphics stack. In addition to DRM and Wayland, Michael will focus on Weston, the reference Wayland compositor.
