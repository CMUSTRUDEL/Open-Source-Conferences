Description: 
	Keynote: Building an Open Source Software Culture at Microsoft - Stephen Walli, Principle Program Manager, Microsoft

Microsoft has been on an open source journey for the past 15 years and many things have happened along the way. Early efforts taught us what the community can do. The cloud changed our relationship with customers and partners. Openness has become central to how we engage. Yet not every step in this journey has been perfect or without controversy. The cultural evolution continues, and this keynote presents the how and why of Microsoftâ€™s open source efforts across organizational boundaries, rethinking the ecosystem and collaboration and embedding open source into its global programs.
