Description: 
	Keynote: Building an Open Source Software Culture at Microsoft - Stephen Walli, Principle Program Manager, Microsoft

Microsoft has been on an open source journey for the past 15 years and many things have happened along the way. Early efforts taught us what the community can do. The cloud changed our relationship with customers and partners. Openness has become central to how we engage. Yet not every step in this journey has been perfect or without controversy. The cultural evolution continues, and this keynote presents the how and why of Microsoftâ€™s open source efforts across organizational boundaries, rethinking the ecosystem and collaboration and embedding open source into its global programs.

good morning everybody can everybody

00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,060
hear me okay good thank you

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,950
so as Jim said my name's Steve Walley

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,309
and I'm a principal program manager at

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,110
Microsoft I'm in the office of the CTL

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,210
with in Azure and I work for John

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,820
Gausman who is our Linux Foundation

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,670
board member and what I want to talk to

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,910
you today about is the growing culture

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,779
around open-source at Microsoft and it's

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,630
really a story about how did we get from

00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:33,600
Steve Ballmer in 2001 calling Linux a

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,510
cancer to having contributed to the

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,059
Linux kernel for nine years now almost a

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,469
decade and literally as a company now we

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,870
have thousands and thousands of

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,140
employees that are active on github

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,480
every day and so this is really it's a

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,370
story of a culture though and I want to

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,460
make sure people understand that its

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,309
culture not strategy because lots of

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,230
folks are concerned we often get the

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,870
question you know is this what this is

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,359
the current strategy from Microsoft the

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,360
way it's often phrased is what happens

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,010
if Sachin adela leaves the less

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,880
comfortable way it's phrased sometimes

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,680
is what happens if Ballmer comes back

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,360
and really so I need to get you to a

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,979
place where you might understand how

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,290
this culture has been evolving and so

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,930
what what changed well certainly our

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,270
industry changed we're in a place now

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,880
where with the cloud and the rise of the

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,820
cloud all cloud infrastructure projects

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,200
are open-source licensed and the

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,090
workloads that were running on the cloud

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,310
at this point so all of the artificial

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,930
intelligence work all the machine

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,939
learning and deep learning work all of

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,909
the data science work all of that

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,619
technology has a foundation of

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,890
open-source license projects at this

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,670
point our customers have certainly

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,049
changed Jim was kind he said I'd been

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,259
around this for a couple of decades it's

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:58,710
actually pushing them on three now if

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,399
you would have asked a customer 15 years

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:06,869
ago do you have open source in your shop

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,539
the CIO would have said no CIO would

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,280
have been wrong but they wouldn't have

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,959
an understanding of what it meant in

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,860
their shop and for their operation at

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,840
the time at

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,610
point if you turn around and you ask the

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,380
average CIO do you have open source in

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,360
your shop a lot of them are nuanced

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,580
enough to know what they're buying how

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,530
they're using it whether or not they've

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,380
got employees that are participating in

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,930
open source projects and then Microsoft

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,220
has changed we're at a point in history

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,550
where we can't hire a developer that

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,720
isn't open source savvy at some level

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,100
whether they're fresh out of school or

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,290
they've been working for the last decade

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,200
or two decades they have some knowledge

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:51,810
on often participation in key

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,430
open-source projects and really I guess

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,290
I want to bring you back to how did we

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,650
get here there is there is an almost

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,260
inevitability to how we got here

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,360
Microsoft has always been a company by

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,400
of and for developers right back to the

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,770
original founders they were developers

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,590
building tools to make other developers

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,170
better and at this point in history

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,260
developers love open source now that's

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,940
that's kind of a trite statement a lot

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,350
of you have heard me we rattle on about

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,989
the fact that we've been collaborating

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,790
on software since we've been writing

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,989
software I can bore you with stories

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:31,230
that go all the way back to 1950 and in

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:34,080
1980 after 30 years of collaboration on

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,500
a network that was you know had taped

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,700
sized packets and conference scheduled

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,340
latency we ended up in a place where the

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,709
US Congress applied copyright law to

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,320
computer software and what you saw was

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,660
18 years then of experimentation with

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,000
licensing to allow us to continue to

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,220
collaborate the same way we had for the

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,570
previous 30 years and that culminated in

00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,850
the open source definition and that

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,350
stood us well for the last 20 years and

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,190
I hope it stands well in its current

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,600
form for the next 20 years so why did

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,100
developers collaborate well we

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,340
collaborate because writing good

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,049
software is hard work and we get better

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,380
by collaborating the software itself

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,060
gets better and we as developers get

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,540
better and learn from each other and

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:24,419
that's why this all works

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:27,160
our current CEO is also a developer and

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:30,520
is kind of carrying that forward

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,130
we did have another CEO between them who

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,770
was not a developer he did say famous

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,470
things about developers once on stage

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,270
he's very supportive of developers but

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,220
with Sacha's background

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,710
Sacha's tried to capture his vision of

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,729
the culture of Microsoft in hit refresh

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,620
and in there he tells a story that

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:53,349
actually I think sets the tone for a lot

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,050
of what you're seeing a number of years

00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:57,819
ago he and another few executives came

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,300
out of a customer meeting and the

00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:04,750
realization was that at this point in

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:09,160
history Linux would have to be a first

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,229
party operating system on Azure and that

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,900
that would come though with a profound

00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:15,009
cultural challenge for the company the

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,590
company that had been the windows

00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,539
company for decades at that point and so

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,949
this has been that journey of seeing

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:25,509
things continue to rise now this isn't

00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,250
just the executives you know culture

00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:28,750
comes from the top revolution comes from

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,220
the bottom but this isn't just the

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,340
executives that are kind of pushing down

00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,699
from the top anders Healdsburg

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,370
is a distinguished engineer at Microsoft

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:43,210
he was the creator of turbo Pascal and

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,849
then he was the architect for C sharp

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,669
and dotnet four years ago he started

00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:51,820
work on typescript and typescript is a

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,740
type safe version of JavaScript that

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,270
compiles down to pure JavaScript so it

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,580
can run anywhere that JavaScript does

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,300
and he started it as an open source

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,810
project and over this last number of

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,430
years

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,349
I guess it's five years now anders is

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,440
convinced he will never do anything not

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:12,880
as an open source project again he just

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,070
feels the typescript is so much better

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,669
and he talks about this that it's so

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,370
much better

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:20,650
not having been purely his creation

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,880
inside of Microsoft that other language

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,039
experts around the planet have

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,900
contributed to it primary users have

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,909
contributed to it it's just a better

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,219
language because the open source

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:34,630
community around typescript has made

00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:39,190
itself you've seen lots of news around

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,150
our growing engagement with the Linux

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,280
community

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,780
at this point in history roughly half

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,889
the VMS on azure are running Linux and

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,910
60% of the solutions in the azure

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:54,639
marketplace are Linux based we've got

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,850
strategic partnerships with major

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,770
companies across the spectrum that whose

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,860
products and services are all based on

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,380
open source projects you can see this

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,380
kind of continuation in the container

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,090
ecosystem again this is a place where

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,160
Microsoft continues to build

00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,530
partnerships with the key companies that

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,560
care about container the container

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:20,020
record ecosystem we continue to engage

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:25,270
in those projects that are key in this

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:27,070
space and really it's it's become it's

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,110
becoming a structured process at

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,199
Microsoft the way we think about it we

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,360
end up in a situation where we will

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,490
we've recognized we have to enable a lot

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,020
of these projects and in the simplest

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,240
form just to enable them in the Azure

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,130
space you know that work started around

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,520
Linux but it continues with lots of

00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,260
other technology we also integrate open

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
source projects into our own products

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,610
and services on Azure so that's why you

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,789
know we have a managed Postgres service

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:58,150
I have managed MySQL service kubernetes

00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:00,610
shows up as IKS on Azure and then we

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,979
continue to release lots of innovative

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,419
technology as open source licenses open

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:06,880
source and try and build those

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,320
communities that make it better it's not

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,130
just things like typescript

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,380
typescript we've the Visual Studio code

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:17,889
was a bit of a surprise to us

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,080
yes code was a reimagining of Visual

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:24,250
Studio but let's do it as an open source

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,710
project a couple of different surveys of

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,810
let us know that it is the most popular

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,240
editing environment in the NGO community

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,620
and it's the most popular editing

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,930
environment in the JavaScript community

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,349
the thing that was kind of disconcerting

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:41,440
for us was that was not on Azure and not

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,560
on Windows and so we continued to engage

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,790
in interesting ways in these places and

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,070
lastly we continued to contribute back

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,540
to the projects that we're using because

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,550
that's fundamentally that kind of the

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,170
economic imperative as engineers

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,920
building products that carries us

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,410
forward

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,499
and that leads us into an ecosystem

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,679
where we've continued as Jim said we are

00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:04,779
platinum members of the Linux Foundation

00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,720
something that many of us never believed

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:10,209
we would actually say out loud but we're

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,859
also members of the cloud native

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,519
computing foundation where members of

00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:14,139
Eclipse

00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,899
we support the Apache Software

00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:18,699
Foundation and then the ecosystem as you

00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,369
broaden that out to his partners were

00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:23,439
there with all of the key players that

00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:27,160
care about open source in their products

00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:29,290
and services and we continue to take

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,839
that as a set of investments that are

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,480
meaningful to us for our customers are

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,949
telling us we have to invest if we're

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,669
going to make agile the best place for

00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:41,649
their computing workloads the last place

00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:44,999
I guess the the other view that I would

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:49,959
try and bring to it it really did start

00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:51,910
with our engagement in Linux and it the

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,970
interesting thing I mean we all love to

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:57,519
take a ding it mr. Ballmer but the work

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:01,749
9 years ago started while the company

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,600
was still run by Steve and at that time

00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:06,279
for us to begin that work he had to

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,589
support it and this was work that's been

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,569
driven for the last nine years and it

00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:13,329
means that we get to a place where the

00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:15,610
platform enablement you saw it grow from

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:18,610
just enabling Linux to actually run on

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,459
hyper-v into these next places where we

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,910
have to take it and then we continue to

00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:26,939
go along with all of these open-source

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,139
projects that we were launching

00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:32,079
invariably either we brought them to

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,389
Linux or partners in that open source

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,819
community brought them to Linux with us

00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:39,249
and so that's been kind of part of this

00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:41,350
growing learning for Microsoft in this

00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:43,360
growing open-source culture and then

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,369
finally you end up in a place where yes

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,230
we're reflecting this back out in our

00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:49,600
engagement in the way we take projects

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:53,339
and turn them into products and and have

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,339
learned from our partners in this space

00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:00,100
we started participating in github as

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:01,959
everybody has to so sooner or later our

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,470
growing contributions in that space

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:07,390
year-on-year led us to a place where

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,010
finally we ended up

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,020
as everybody's well aware of at this

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:15,010
point we're in the process of acquiring

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,860
github the stated mission right now is

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,940
to not mess with github so this isn't

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,010
something we're all of a sudden you're

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,650
gonna be seeing Microsoft ads on github

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,510
or anything like that again you go back

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,990
to that deep culture of Microsoft

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,760
Microsoft is a company by oven for

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,830
developers and at this point in history

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,040
the place that developers live in the

00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,920
open-source community is on github but

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,440
we've also ended up in a space where

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,410
we've begun to participate in ways that

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,810
are that would be meaningful if indeed

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,940
Microsoft was a proper Linux company now

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,230
and so recently you've seen the

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,230
announcements where we've joined the

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:57,250
open innovation network and the lot

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,860
network and so I want to leave you at

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,710
this point with a quote from Sachin

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,280
adela because he does continue to leave

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:08,320
lead this growing culture of open source

00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,140
and openness at Microsoft and that

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,810
really is judges by the actions that

00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,900
we're taking right now judges by these

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,700
actions as we go forward and that I

00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,530
think is the best that we can hope for

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,620
and the best that we can ask as a

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,640
participant in this broader community

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,590
and with that I'd like to thank you very

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,030
much for your time this morning and I

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,830
hope you all have a great rest of your

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,830
day at the conference thank you

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,179
