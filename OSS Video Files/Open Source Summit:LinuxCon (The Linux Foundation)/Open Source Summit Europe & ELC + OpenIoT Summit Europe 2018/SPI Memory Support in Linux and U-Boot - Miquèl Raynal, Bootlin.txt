	SPI Memory Support in Linux and U-Boot - Miquèl Raynal, Bootlin

For a long time already, SPI memories have been supported in Linux and U-Boot. They were relatively small and slow (like dataflash and EEPROM) but the new trend in the embedded world is now leaning towards fast SPI NOR and SPI NAND devices which people tend to use as their main storage.

In this talk Miquèl will present how those devices work and how you can get the best performance out of them by using advanced SPI modes like Dual or Quad SPI. He will also talk about the rework he did in Linux and U-Boot to be able to support all kinds of SPI memories (SPI NOR, SPI NAND, SPI SRAM) using the same SPI controller driver and still be able to benefit from advanced features (like direct mapping) provided by some SPI controllers.
