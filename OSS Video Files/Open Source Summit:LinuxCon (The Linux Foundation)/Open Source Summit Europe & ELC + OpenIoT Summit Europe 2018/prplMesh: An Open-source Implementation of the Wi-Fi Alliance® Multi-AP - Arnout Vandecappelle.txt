Description: 
	prplMesh: An Open-source Implementation of the Wi-Fi Alliance® Multi-AP Specification - Arnout Vandecappelle, Essensium/Mind

The Wi-Fi Alliance® Multi-AP specification allows access points to work together to create a self-monitoring and self-adapting network providing optimal coverage in the home. The prpl foundation has sponsored an open-source, "carrier-grade" implementation of this specification called prplMesh, which is based on an implementation of the IEEE 1905.1a specification provided by the BroadBand Forum. This talk explains the architecture of prplMesh, how it fits into the existing network stack (bridge configuration, hostapd/wpa_supplicant, cfg80211), and what it means to be "carrier-grade". We will also show how it integrates with openWRT and RDK-B. Finally, we will highlight how several companies have banded together to fund this development.
