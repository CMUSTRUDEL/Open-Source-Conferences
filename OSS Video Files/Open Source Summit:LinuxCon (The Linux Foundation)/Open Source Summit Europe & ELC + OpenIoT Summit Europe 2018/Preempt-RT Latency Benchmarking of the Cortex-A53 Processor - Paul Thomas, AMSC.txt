	Preempt-RT Latency Benchmarking of the Cortex-A53 Processor - Paul Thomas, AMSC

ARMv8 processors are becoming more common in the industrial market. It is useful to understand how well these processors perform with Preempt-RT. AMSC looked at the CortexA53 utilized in the ZYNQ UlataScale+ processors form Xilinx. The Cortex-A53 is an ARMv8 processor with an 8-stage in-order pipeline. The performance was compared with a Cortex-A9, a 10+ stage out-of-order pipeline. Even with the difference in pipeline design in these two processors, it is an interesting comparison because it represents the evolution of Xilinxâ€™s ZYNQ product line.

Three different latency tests were performed: standard cyclictest latency, external hardware interrupt latency (as utilized by the IIO subsystem) and Ethernet UDP latency. Analyzing the performance of a hardware interrupt can be tricky, the method of utilizing a timer with a capture function is detailed in the presentation.
