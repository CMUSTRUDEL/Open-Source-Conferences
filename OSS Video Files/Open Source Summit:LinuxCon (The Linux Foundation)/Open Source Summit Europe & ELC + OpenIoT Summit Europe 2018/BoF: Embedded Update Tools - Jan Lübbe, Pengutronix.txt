Description: 
	BoF: Embedded Update Tools - Jan L端bbe, Pengutronix

 This BoF will start with a quick overview of existing open source update tools and servers. As there are many alternatives by now, the focus of the BoF will be to have an open discussion between users and developers about real-world experiences and unsolved problems.

Some possible topics that could be discussed based on interest:
- Benefits vs. complexity of multiple signatures (TUF)
- Detecting a successful update
- Automated testing of the update process
- Delta-updates for bandwidth-constrained devices (GSM)
- Migration of user data
- Peer to peer update distribution
- ...

Although the submitter is the author of rauc, the intention is to focus on use-cases and not on specific tools.
