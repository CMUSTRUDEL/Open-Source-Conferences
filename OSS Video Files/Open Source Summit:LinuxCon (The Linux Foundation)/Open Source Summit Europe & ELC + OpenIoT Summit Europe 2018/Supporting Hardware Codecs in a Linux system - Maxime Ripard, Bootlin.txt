	Supporting Hardware Codecs in a Linux system - Maxime Ripard, Bootlin

Every modern multimedia-oriented ARM SoC usually has a hardware controller to decode and encode video streams. The Linux kernel framework of choice to support these controllers is the v4l2 subsystem.

This talk will walk through the changes that were needed to support our codec in the v4l2 stack, the challenges we faced during the driver development and, once the driver development done, the issues we faced
to make the hardware decoding useful to general-purpose video players like Kodi, gstreamer or VLC.

The presentation is based on the work we have done to develop a v4l2 driver for the Allwinner video encoder/decoder controller on top of a mainline kernel.
