good morning everyone how are you out

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:13,799
there let's see I see a blank slide on

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:16,109
the show so I'm looking for 10,000

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,109
developers to help electrify the planet

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,320
LF energy is an open source ecosystem to

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:25,800
enable the energy transition our mission

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,740
to us is to accelerate and transform the

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,990
world's relationship to energy and we're

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,750
having our first summit next door on

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:39,559
Wednesday and I invite you all to come

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:43,110
and join us so we only have 10 years now

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:48,149
the UN climate report says maybe we have

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,809
12 years to reduce our carbon by 40

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,020
percent

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:58,140
but decarbonisation of our economies is

00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:01,890
deeply related to the prosperity of our

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,110
communities so fossil fuel and our power

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,470
and transportation systems are the cause

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,710
yet energy is what powers our economies

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,360
so this is a vexing problem and

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,390
decarbonisation poses a challenge to our

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,280
economic foundations at LF energy we

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,590
believe that not only can we decarbonize

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,740
but we can unleash technological

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,840
innovation this is a picture of the

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,840
internet No

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:37,890
ok this is a picture of the internet

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,140
back in 1998 at a time when we could

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,700
first make database queries we imagined

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,610
that there was going to be a convergence

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,009
of the internet telecommunications TVs

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,649
movies we had no idea that we were going

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,380
to have an ability to have 10,000 songs

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,600
in our pockets or chronicle our lives or

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,000
have very quiet dinners with our

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,700
partners who we have been talking to or

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,009
we text to but just like the internet

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,040
the finest and most brilliant Grid

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,649
architects are really reimagining the

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,440
grid of the future as a massively

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,740
connected highly distributed and hugely

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,140
redundant and self-healing systems

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,630
so and then in that sense we need to web

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,880
a fie energy and that's why some people

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,560
have called it the Internet of energy so

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,630
we need to leverage the same design

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,340
principles that we use to scale the

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,530
Internet this is our design challenge in

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,210
the next 10 years because I'm going to

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,730
make it a B hag and we're gonna go for

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:45,780
it in two more in less than two years we

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:48,630
need to remove 94% of the co2 emissions

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,180
in power and transportation in order to

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:59,280
stay below 1.5 degrees I think that this

00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:02,490
is possible this is the old system this

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,840
is just kind of like in a few seconds we

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:08,640
have generation transmission

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,520
distribution it's rigid it's been

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,230
centralized it's been extremely reliable

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,640
it's allowed this to happen

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,920
although Scotland is a remarkable place

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,910
in terms of its commitment to renewable

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,250
energy power systems has typically

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,420
looked at investments in 50 to 80 year

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:33,690
windows and not an easy system to change

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,780
so it's been quite monolithic but we do

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,580
not have the opportunity to actually

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,850
build some kind of a monolithic

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,150
centralized energy system we need to

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:50,490
figure out how to do this quickly in

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:53,040
order to flip the whole world in the

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,950
transition from fossil fuels to

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,740
renewable and distributed energy so the

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:04,920
new model variable energy massively

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:09,450
distributed connected assets connected

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,890
homes connected buildings connected

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:17,310
vehicles connected infrastructure

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,540
connected markets that's what we're

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,180
doing and I think that every single

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,400
person in this room knows how to build

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,320
the communication infrastructure to

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,830
connect things and that's the reason why

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,439
we're here

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:32,580
this is a new grid composed of variable

00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:36,960
energy from photovoltaics wind batteries

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,719
automobiles massively direct distributed

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,490
multi-directional and this is the

00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:43,050
problem that we're trying to solve and

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,460
this is a problem that you know how to

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,680
solve so this is a hero's journey and I

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,699
think that for those of you particularly

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:58,259
in your 20s 30s and 40s and this is a

00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:01,289
problem that you are going to have to

00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:04,590
solve in order to provide the conditions

00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:06,840
for your children your grandchildren to

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:15,120
live comfortably and to have economic

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:17,310
prosperity so it's a hero's journey at

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,409
the Linux Foundation we've seen how

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,349
open-source shared technology can

00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:25,919
transform industries now it's time for

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:28,229
energy and power imagine a future where

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,719
energy is delivered and used more

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:34,080
efficiently by leveraging information

00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:36,389
and communication technologies a future

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,550
based on smart electric grids

00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:40,740
a future where we can accelerate the

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,370
energy transition with clean power

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,099
sources

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,560
LF energy is a new Linux Foundation

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:49,080
project that supports multi-vendor

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,659
collaboration and open source shared

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,699
technology innovation to help create the

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:57,270
electricity and power systems of

00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:00,169
tomorrow all because we believe in the

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,169
future that we share

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:13,360
so let's begin come next door you can

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:16,960
you can actually get a ticket at the OSS

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,639
registration for just $200 join us find

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,800
out about it find out about the projects

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,230
that we're working on the code that's in

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,360
process what we're where we are and what

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,550
we're doing is the first gathering and I

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,770
want to thank all of you come for the

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,760
beginning stay for the journey it's time

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:37,110
to get started thank you

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,110
