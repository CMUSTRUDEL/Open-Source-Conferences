	The Seven Year Leap - Updating a Product from Linux 2.6 to 4.15, a Real-World Project Case Study - Ed Langley, Kobilon

Many Linux devices actively developed/maintained out there for niche markets are still running a 2.6 series kernel. Backporting becomes a regular habit, but often updating the kernel is deemed too risky.

In this talk, Ed Langley will discuss a real-world project in which he did just that - update a single purpose OMAP3 based Android device from 2.6.37 to 4.15.

What issues in the project finally led to the upgrade? How was the effort estimated? Convincing upper management to go ahead, task breakdown and planning out the approach.

On the technical side: What just worked, and what did not, what used to require a separate driver 7 years ago, and is now accomplished in 3 lines of a dts file. Closed source GPU driver woes, and fun with running 4.15 whilst trying to stick with Android KitKat. Yes, you can run old Android on a new kernel!

Finally, how long did it all take in the end? 

About Ed Langley
Ed has been working on device drivers, BSPs and userspace software for embedded products for Linux and other OSes, in a professional capacity for the last 12 years or so. Most of that time has been spent with embedded software consultancies - most recently Adeneo/Witekio and now Kobilon, helping customers with Linux drivers and BSPs in order to get their devices to market. These roles have given quite a varied insight into many industries which are integrating ever more complex and connected software.

Ed last spoke at a conference at the UK Unix Users Group back in 2009, so this would be a return after a rather long break from presenting!
