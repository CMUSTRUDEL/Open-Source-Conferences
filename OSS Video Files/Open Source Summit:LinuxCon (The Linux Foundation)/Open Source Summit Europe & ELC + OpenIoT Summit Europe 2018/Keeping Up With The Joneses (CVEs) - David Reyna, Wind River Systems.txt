Description: 
	Keeping Up With The Joneses (CVEs) - David Reyna, Wind River Systems

Keeping up to date with security issues once a product has been released isn’t as easy as it first seems. There’s a well-known database of all security issues hosted by MITRE, but the data isn’t reliable enough to be trusted blindly. You could upgrade to the latest release of every software package you ship, but packages may be unmaintained or introduce new bugs. There is essentially no silver bullet for the problem of security updates.

In this presentation, we will explain why the obvious solutions are flawed, what the alternatives are, how best practises can be shared to reduce the time between fix announcement and deployment, and discuss how best to handle keeping up to date with security issues.

okay very good thank you for coming

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,370
we'll get started so keeping up with the

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,820
joins us I did not come up with this

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,099
title but we're talking about CDEs we're

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,870
talking about security spawns teams were

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,940
talking about tools we're talking about

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,240
trying to address inefficiency to make

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,260
our jobs better faster less cost to us

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,410
into our customers so security response

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,900
management risk cost and best practices

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,220
in an imperfect world let's talk about

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,560
that so we're gonna keep our products

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,840
secure that's requirement for survival

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,300
need to keep the suit but however the

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,309
secure data available is a lot of it

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,239
there's a flood of data and it's also

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,860
not complete sometimes misleading and we

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,410
have to be careful we need it but we

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,030
need to be careful how we rely on it it

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,980
can be very efficient efficient

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,989
resulting a high cost to try to manage

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,329
the stream of CVS for your corporation

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,239
and for your customers so we need to

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,949
share best practices knowledge awareness

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,049
automation and tools so the agenda today

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,820
I'll be talking about understanding CDE

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:11,220
sources CDE quality CD volume managing

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,770
your security response cost best

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,780
practices solutions and we also like to

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,290
introduce a tool that we are now sharing

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,500
with the open source world the general

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,869
patch workflow is I'm putting us in the

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,909
center so above us is a upstream CV

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,009
source that is gathering the data and

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,450
fighting the vulnerabilities and they're

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,439
going to be publishing that hopefully in

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:38,430
the CVE database you or me is in the

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,710
center where a vendor where om we scan

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,079
the upstream for the CVS and their

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,500
status we manage our response to those

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,439
triage match against our products try to

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,970
understand them better we fix them we

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,340
create the patches for our customers

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,500
downstream and then the customers we see

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,640
those and then test and deploy all are

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,659
we talking about the items in the orange

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,310
and focus on that because they're the

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,079
other topics there's conferences about

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,119
that but I want to address this middle

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,229
topic about managing the security

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,690
response so now everyone's here so I so

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,410
everyone knows what a CDE is my question

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,490
is how

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,320
you've actually looked at a CVE record

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:22,890
okay how many of you never ever seen a

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,390
CVE record my goodness okay I don't

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,300
think I need to do this slide I'll do it

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,790
anyway so description field it has the

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,590
severity score just had this in mind it

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,020
also has the attack vector with the

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,120
domain scores and such it has a list of

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,390
affected products which is the CP East

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,920
as you all know it has the list of

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,900
support links people have attached

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,870
helpful documents hopefully patches

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,390
reproducers in support material and it

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,220
has also a category for the weakness so

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,840
just for completeness that is what a CBE

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,840
record is we'll have to keep that in

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,880
mind as we try to analyze what they are

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,740
the upstream sources mitre is the

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,190
corporation that is responsible for

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,680
maintaining the CVE list they passed the

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,000
actual data onto the nist nationalists

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,790
to the course of standards and

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,220
technology they have the m BD which is

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,320
the national vulnerability database that

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,750
tracks all the information their

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,959
hardware vendors also supply information

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,850
the software maintainer z' distros also

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,030
track the things that have lied to them

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,940
the the response to the activities and

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,459
how it applies to their various releases

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,010
there's also many other sources more ad

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,860
hoc more random or different mailing

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,010
lists websites forums and some are

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,360
private and some are public and this is

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,020
a place of course to find stuff that

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,340
isn't quite maybe a CVE yet or

00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,160
information about status has not been

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,270
published yet in the public forums so

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,420
let's talk about the normal workflow

00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:54,480
this is the one that we expect and pray

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,320
for it's very very easy the community

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,450
discovers a vulnerability mitre there

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,530
may be a step where goes first to the

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,100
private listed mitre

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,890
reserved CDE record and in that case

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,050
maybe a vendor under NDA will be working

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,630
on it and do the test at some point it

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,760
gets moved to public in the mitre list

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,640
and at that point it's also published to

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,650
the general world in the NIST list the

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,440
vendors work on it provide a public

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,630
patch the patch goes to the vendors who

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,340
will present their customers and they

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,850
test and patch provide that to the

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,010
customer

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,140
in the end the customers receive the fix

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,710
and everything is fine this is what

00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,900
people expect and hope for what often

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,540
happens is this things are out of order

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,910
things are delayed their discovery in

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,780
the community might or may reserve it

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,360
and work is done however the vendors may

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,470
publish your patch before it's made

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,760
public by later so and then some people

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,740
who are watching those days will see

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,330
that that has happened and they'll say

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,580
what where did that come from and then

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,250
we'll start applying patches and then at

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,190
some point later on mightor might then

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,710
mark it as public and at that time

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,990
sometime later that this might also

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,460
market is public so what's happened is

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,040
there's a delay if you're not watching

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,840
these various sources you may miss a

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,080
patch that has happened a vulnerability

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,400
a patch of this happens and that is

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,840
going to be a problem and it's

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,240
especially embarrassing if your customer

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,400
finds it first that's pretty sad you get

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,110
an escalation and get a a call and you

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,420
have to explain what's happened but it

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,120
happens so the thing is that you have to

00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,530
be careful the nice workflow doesn't

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,600
always happen so you have to keep your

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,030
eyes open you have to be aware of the

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,770
vendors you have to be flexible when

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,610
you're people fighting it first and you

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,650
can't rely on NIST being the latest word

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,010
you can't rely on mitre being the latest

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,990
word so you have to be vigilant now

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,630
sometimes it's more complicated than

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,310
that I won't name this particular

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,010
escalation but it can sometimes be a

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,240
mess and nobody always will be

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,100
high-profile CVEs where everything it

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,540
just gets a mess so let's just talk

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,930
about some of these because this really

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,690
brought into our view how many issues

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,510
had many small indications in efficiency

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,300
skydived up to big deficiencies so

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,040
something is discovered is reserved in

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,840
mitre they start working out in the

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,320
background and sometimes they work a

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,380
long time and sometimes this made public

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,290
before the community before it goes to

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,200
mitre or to NIST and mainly just will

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,090
feel it without any just announced to

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,620
the world so people start all of a

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,380
sudden discover and if it's a big

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,570
high-profile one then they'll be panic

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,740
from customers a big surprise for the

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,120
customer it's a big surprise

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,520
the vendor because you did not know

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,290
about that and sometimes it takes even

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,670
longer to solve stuff and while you're

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,620
waiting for patches are waiting for

00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,750
solutions you start have to dealing with

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,310
your customers they want to know what's

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,990
happening and you may not know yourself

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,430
and you're trying to also find out

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,800
what's going on you're caught in the

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,630
middle of information that people

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,090
desperately want to know the answers and

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,590
so you get into this loop of trying to

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,090
find the answer it's trying to deal with

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,070
your customers and keep everyone happy

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,980
you get in this in this loop of meetings

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,320
of writing papers gathering reports and

00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,550
trying to try every little patch you can

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,990
find and you find that it's very

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,410
wasteful in time and very very stressful

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,360
of course but how you organize your data

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,550
can really affect how well you can

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,200
respond to all these extra pressures so

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,300
in the end you get a patch everyone's

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,760
happy or happy enough and you move on

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,650
but you then have lost a tremendous

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,270
amount of time and of course you'll be

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,040
losing time for actually fixing the

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,660
problems but you've lost time just

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,130
dealing with the problem trying to

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,790
regather all the information so I'll be

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:47,880
talking about that in some detail

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,560
quality of the CDs that can be an issue

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,870
they can be very brief in their

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,130
discussion they can be not complete they

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,260
could be in fact slightly misleading

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,880
about what's inside the description but

00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,270
sometimes that's all you have to work

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,220
off of the muesli see bees have a the

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,080
cpe list of the affected products and

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,610
their releases and you would hope that

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,590
that would be complete and certainly

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,630
mature CVE so that is pretty complete

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,790
and accurate however if you're working

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,680
on stuff that is new it can be either

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,620
incomplete incorrect incorrect or in

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,280
fact missing and in fact most recent CVS

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,070
there is no CPE list the content may

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,630
have missing or a few contact click

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,150
links so you may have nothing to work

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,010
with just a description and you just

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,530
have to start searching the community

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,070
asking people well what is it about do

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,300
you ever be producer what can we do and

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,650
you also have to be continually scanning

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,510
the information because it's big

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,400
changing halten getting more mature more

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,350
correct but it could take a while for

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,850
the information to be at a state where

00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,100
you can use it so you need to keep

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,800
looking and that's a lot of polling a

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,240
lot of looking a lot of time and

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,370
sometimes there's a glaze of the content

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,050
updates we talked about the mitre versus

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,029
nest but you have to

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,200
Proactive he had to also be patient

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:03,899
sometimes quality issues too this really

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,600
affects people like us sure always were

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,279
about to release and the customers gonna

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,709
want to know or are you vulnerable to

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,410
these defects well the last 20 or last

00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:16,019
400 there's no information beside the

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,390
description so what are you gonna do you

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,700
need to start looking at other ways to

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,170
analyze this stuff to know if at least

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,700
if you're not vulnerable if you are

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,200
vulnerable then you can lose market you

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,390
can then promise that there'll be a

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,100
update at some point you just have to

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,870
have something in your hands but

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,820
unfortunately for people releasing

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,680
that's exactly the information you do

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,589
not have from the CVE so you have to be

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,420
more creative and if you're gonna run it

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,589
have tools that are trying to do work

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,519
for you about CDEs

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:46,140
like auto testers auto scanners auto

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,640
research tools you have to also be

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,649
careful because as I said the

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,290
information could be incomplete could be

00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:54,540
inaccurate in big ways but also in small

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,279
ways we've had situations where the last

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,620
little bit of the version numbers

00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,070
different from what you expected and if

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,899
you have your tools that are readily

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,420
reliable on the information you could be

00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,709
making big misses on stuff where it

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,959
should be matches so you have to be very

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:13,620
flexible in the tools that you try to

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,360
use to assist you let's give examples of

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,700
some CVS that we've had problems with

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,520
give you a sample of what issues come up

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:25,260
for example 2017 13 to 2-0 the CPS you

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,670
can see they said it was for Google

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,680
Android and that's probably where they

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,450
found it however they starts talking

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,820
about kernel issues well that's a very

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,260
different thing so you have to be always

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,270
vigilant in that case you have to go

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,100
maybe to the description maybe to the

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,860
patch is actually there and you have to

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,899
go that extra mile unfortunately for the

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,199
next one to five to four they had this

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:49,170
CPE which claims read line 6.3 and below

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:51,209
but in fact was 6.0 and above again you

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:56,699
have to take the information and be

00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:59,670
vigilant about it 87 - it was against

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:02,010
this is a 1 yeah that was resulted in a

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,140
bug and a patch but extreme ignored it

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,630
and it was fixed in a different patch

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,819
but no mention or reference no cross

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,129
reference to the CB was made so

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,929
it may say is fixed but ethics never

00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,089
went in it's actually got fixed over

00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:17,039
there you hope but how do you know if

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,079
that patch is actually in your system or

00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,999
not did you are you avoidable have you

00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,289
been patched and unfortunately these are

00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:25,549
exceptions that you have to keep your

00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:30,239
minds open for and the final one 10

00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:33,149
one-nine-five dark CVE reserved however

00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:35,459
there is a patch for their system but

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,439
it's for a software that's long dead and

00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:41,489
the patch will never go up to stream so

00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:42,569
it's a black CVE there's a fix but do

00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:44,279
you know what got in and the question

00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,479
you have to ask to your customer course

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,119
are you Ivana bowl

00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:50,100
so this is a dead one that's maybe fix

00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:52,049
probably not but there's a digit vector

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,819
system so you have to be vigilant to

00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:55,799
know about this ones that are not

00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:59,939
actually affecting you that may not be

00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:02,100
around talk about the volume of CVS this

00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:04,919
growing is more than a thousand per

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,379
month and you have to evaluate every

00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:08,819
single one because every single one even

00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,100
it looks like it doesn't apply to you it

00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:13,829
may as you saw in the previous examples

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,119
so you can't just read it and go on you

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,339
have to actually look at it and it's

00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:19,259
unfortunately expensive and it's

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,389
unfortunate because you know maybe only

00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,609
30 percent of the CVS or less than

00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,379
actually applied to you but you have to

00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:27,299
look at every single one and it has to

00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,429
be done by someone who is aware of the

00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:30,689
limitations of the quality of data of

00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:33,899
the CVEs

00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:36,509
your number is expensive but also you

00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:39,269
give it yes the analysis is also very

00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:42,119
expensive the expertise so that's that

00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:44,249
takes time so end course incorrectly

00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:46,979
categorizing the CV you can have even

00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:48,629
greater cost cost in an escalation cost

00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:50,909
and a lower ability to your customer

00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,249
cost in trying to repair that so it can

00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:55,139
be very costly to do but you have to be

00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:59,129
careful because the cost of not doing it

00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:01,799
it can be even greater volume of CVS

00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,149
just an example it's been growing it's

00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,689
almost been double in the last two years

00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:09,019
and is growing more in this example

00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:10,169
looking the data there was 14,000 in

00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:12,359
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:14,279
fourteen thousand six hundred five

00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,929
thousand four hundred actually defects

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,459
against our particular system as it

00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:19,230
turns out and some of those of course

00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,950
spread across different releases we have

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,260
multiple releases in

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,940
this case five for that last period so

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,010
the volume is just increasing and

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,690
increasing um not quite expansion

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,830
exponentially but it's Creek racing

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:35,170
pretty fast so there's tools there's a

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,710
ones called scanner system analysis

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,650
scanners

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,690
an example is Nexus Nexus they can be

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,160
very valuable for targeting product

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,350
systems so they have a lot of features

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,150
around that they can tell you about non

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,610
vult abilities but they do not tell you

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,960
what you are not vulnerable to and in

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,370
Fortune the customer is going to want to

00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,560
know that answer what are you not

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,280
honorable to in addition to what you are

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,210
vulnerable to so they can really be

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,370
understand their system and know that

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,710
where they are stand with that the

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,950
almost the results are mostly in the

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,930
area of needs more analysis more

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,210
investigation so it's still a lot of

00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,250
work after they do it's good to have is

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,080
a good backstop for fighting stuff on

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,910
the fly but you have to be aware of his

00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,940
limitations and of course it depends on

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,440
the information it has so all the gaps

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,260
in problems of CDEs

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,060
they're magnified in the tools so you

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,620
have to be have to understand what

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,960
they're trying to do and how to flexible

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,940
other scanning tools for example the

00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,310
build and source analysis tools examples

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,470
are black duck Yocto project we have a

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,090
tool called CV report the dependency

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,280
tracker there's many that do this and

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,230
where they scan be either the raw

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,990
software or they scan the builds as they

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,580
go by they can be more precise then

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,290
system analysis because they have more

00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,950
access to more information they can do

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:53,080
check sums and such the however you can

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,550
trigger and stuff that is there in the

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,040
software but as Deborah actually built

00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,380
into running system they finds it it's a

00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,890
false positive so you have to be careful

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,430
about that

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,410
you also have determine what is

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,090
vulnerable but it doesn't tell you again

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,040
what you're not vulnerable to it just

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,260
tells you what is they found and again

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,750
is too reliant on the known information

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,850
from CVS we hope they have extra secret

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,650
sauce they've been analyzing stuff but

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,810
it has to be careful about what comes

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,090
out of it so let's talk about the

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:25,480
general topic of security response

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:27,700
management so here's my central thesis

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,830
while there's heightened awareness about

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,200
device vulnerabilities which is often

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:35,220
missing is awareness of the process of

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,290
managing secure response its

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,579
it's um this is all overhead you're not

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,489
making money off of this this is

00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:44,109
overhead but on it but perhaps hopefully

00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,970
overhead to beacon controlling to

00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,589
understand at least and it doesn't make

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,019
money but it does protect money it

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:52,899
protects money from escalations about

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:56,290
liability your car your customers trust

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:59,889
in you so it does it costs money but it

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:01,660
can protect money so can the issues are

00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,209
trying to manage this whole stream and

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,249
CBS is mad at work is growing there's

00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:07,779
stuff coming in all the time and it's

00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,910
just getting worse and you probably have

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:10,869
a support bait Rick's not just a current

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,720
release you probably have a couple

00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:15,279
releases in the back so and one of the

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,439
problems is that the picks for this

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,299
release that kernel may be different for

00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:22,329
that release and DAC kernel and that

00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:25,299
release that kernel and so we have to

00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:28,329
that's a lot of work and so the the

00:16:25,299 --> 00:16:30,220
support matrix is is a big factor in

00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:32,589
this vulnerabilities often apply as

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,119
again to jeff releases the ada is not

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,100
often well integrated to your other

00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:38,559
systems you may have your defect system

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,389
here the agile system here your incoming

00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,239
CBE's your patches out there the

00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:45,129
engineers over the wall so there's some

00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:46,689
you may not have it things integrated

00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,889
and when things are not integrated

00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:50,619
information not flowing

00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:52,419
there's inefficiencies lost stuff and a

00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:54,669
lot of time spent trying to find

00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:57,699
information polling people it's just

00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:59,889
lost time and if you're lucky enough

00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:01,600
have access to embargo data then you

00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,819
have to track that also separately and

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,019
that's another burden it's a value but

00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:07,149
it's a burden because you have to keep

00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:08,500
make sure you have control of that that

00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:10,870
the right people have access to that

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,610
that you can move it quickly often that

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:15,639
stock gets lost in private directories

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:19,389
lost an email and you had that's just a

00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:21,549
way to lose time and stuff there are

00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:24,699
companies that you can offload your work

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:27,370
to if you don't have the expertise or

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,500
the time to do it the benefits is they

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:32,620
can provide missing expertise and or

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,440
bandwidth and or resources but that

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,779
pass-through can we reduce your customer

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,490
response time this also can be very very

00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:41,169
expensive some can be phenomenally

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,230
expensive they're taking along a lower

00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:45,639
risk but that's expensive the

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,230
corporation so it's probably better if

00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:48,340
you can bring some of that in-house if

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,720
there's ways to make it more

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,789
it's effective will you be able to do

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,120
this without trying outsource it

00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:57,429
so defect systems well what about those

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,169
often not the best place attract

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,059
security issues the reason is that

00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:06,130
security issues and vulnerabilities

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:08,080
often across products whereas defect

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,299
systems kind of focus on single products

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,799
single releases so they don't cover

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,779
stuff so it's hard to have information

00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,779
carry across and track it at a high

00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:18,130
level and you may not even have

00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:20,710
understanding of what applies to yet you

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,570
may have a vulnerability that is vague

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,159
or you're trying to understand under

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,750
investigation well where do you track it

00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,210
where do you put it what bucket it has

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,799
no bucket so that's another reason that

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,740
a defect system may not be the best

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,649
place hard to manage your embargoed data

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,350
if you ever work with JIRA or Mozilla

00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:40,330
it's focused on single products you can

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,250
make one invisible but if you have

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,360
defects against that release well how do

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,250
you track that do you have a shadow

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,789
product and if you have an access list

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,770
of ABC for that and DFG for that how do

00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,409
you extend all the different matrices of

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,480
access lists so it's very very difficult

00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:58,059
to really effectively use your defect

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,960
system so you need some global global

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:03,880
something more powerful so let's talk

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,820
about the costs just kind of summarize

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,100
before we go on tracking upstream CVS

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,960
that's a cost you have to do it creating

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,690
a fixing defects you have to do it

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,730
providing updates to customers whether

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,330
it's the actual patches or just response

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,559
or your conversations meetings whatever

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,750
this is something you have to do and

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,700
providing patches to customers that's

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,429
just something you have to do let's talk

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,710
about the unnecessary costs and this is

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:31,270
where I'm going with this repeated

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:35,110
manual pulling of the upstream is

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:37,240
expensive that takes a lot of effort and

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,970
you have to do it repeatedly also trying

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,039
to track your defect status again you

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,630
can maybe do some reports but it's also

00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,149
very difficult and time-consuming to

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,309
manually pull other information and then

00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:52,299
start matching against these CVS coming

00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:55,120
in and analyzing all those CVS I keep

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:57,549
mentioning incoming CVS and analysis

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,110
that's actually a huge pain point again

00:19:57,549 --> 00:19:59,980
because you have to look at every single

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,269
one

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,250
and if you're just got to have your

00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:05,980
engineer go in once a month once a week

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,260
once a day sometimes and try to

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,500
reanalyze stuff they're spending a lot

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:14,049
of time looking around and trying to

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,809
analyze what they have in their hands

00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:18,970
and we got to do better with that you

00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:20,919
have to also tracking all the patches

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,269
reports and documents they could be in

00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,830
20 different directories that could be

00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:26,049
lost in email that could be many places

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,429
and that's not efficient you need to be

00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:30,460
able to get this stuff and share it

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:34,299
quickly and easily across the team you

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:36,429
have to status for customers and for

00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,529
management and also if you're tracking

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:40,750
embargoed data you have to keep track

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:43,179
for compliance reasons about who know do

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,740
do what win so that's hard to do if

00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:47,590
you're not having a tool to assist you

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,389
with that you have to do reports you

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,919
have to keep track you have to look

00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:52,539
around that's a lot of effort trying to

00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,429
manage all that and then be able to

00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,169
prove to your management that you will

00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:58,480
be compliant and you have actually

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:00,970
disclosed all the information and then

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,590
you have to repackage your results

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,210
you're going to probably publish your

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,130
CVS on your public site to your

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,190
customers to see that also takes effort

00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,049
to gather that information and this

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,970
place is for information get out of sync

00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:15,220
and you have to do this over and over

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,539
and over again because everything is

00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,710
moving or everything is changing

00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,929
everything is probably getting better

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,960
but you have to keep doing this over and

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,460
over again and that's just a huge cost

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,950
so best practices how do we deal with

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,049
that it's expensive for us I'm sure it's

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,700
expensive for you so here are some of

00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:32,760
the sums we could thinks we have come up

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,139
with a lot of mate as much as possible

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,510
don't expect your engineers to do this

00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:38,350
this just takes too much time it's too

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,539
inefficient

00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,220
you gotta oughta me and you got to spend

00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:45,549
the money on automation when we were

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,019
growing up you know 200 CVS a month and

00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:49,029
handle that that's just an incremental

00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:51,250
cost will just absorb that yes to a

00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:52,960
thousand my goodness that's a lot of

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,490
time incremental over and over

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,440
it's garden and it's just getting worse

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,149
so you gotta just do animation you guys

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,539
spend the time spend the money and get

00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:03,100
it done because so that's for gathering

00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,350
the data upstream all the chain

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,789
certifications pulling your defect

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,409
systems you don't have to keep mainly

00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,350
looking at it every time want to notice

00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:15,230
to say the system is for your reports

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,640
the reporting tools you might as well

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,500
just have something generally reports

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,060
why keep doing it by hand you have the

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,710
information you'll probably add in

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,540
accuracy so you can do it by hand all

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,580
the time

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,960
automate it and hear straight Auto track

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,370
our tracking so you can do your

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
compliance you can show your customers

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,510
you're a vigilant you can do your

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,550
compliance for your embargoed data prove

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,630
you're compliant have tools to do that

00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:42,020
for you rather than doing it all by hand

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:44,270
use multiple sources NIST mitre of

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,280
course use those but keep vigilant about

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,890
the other sources as I mentioned and

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,530
maybe fix their red hat Mino is fixed

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,210
debian might nose fixed bash my nose

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,830
fixed you got to keep looking at these

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,720
different sources and keep them in mind

00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,610
when you track what's going on because

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,950
they may have more time with it they may

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,900
have had actual fixed it so you got to

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,940
keep vigilant about all the other people

00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,980
and that way you can stay in the game

00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,420
and stay ahead and again you want to

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,070
find the answers and solutions before

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,260
your customers do so that you can be the

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,960
smartest guy in the room or women

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,240
aggregate the data don't keep it all

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,430
separated aggregators so that you can

00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,930
run reports compare the information be

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,030
always up-to-date have their way the

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,550
integrated defects CVEs

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:28,220
status customers products keep that

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:32,840
integrated and easy to build stuff upon

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:36,560
that best practices to provide easy

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,330
access to the data have your manager be

00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,120
able to run the report so you don't have

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,880
to be able to auto generate stuff on

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,770
demand for your customer database all

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,350
these things that you get the email okay

00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,210
a down the report another report have

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,700
have it easy to get to in a safe manner

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,720
of course have it easy for your field

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,310
people to find the appropriate

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,650
information so they can quickly find

00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,960
answers for their customers make it easy

00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,700
to do that because continual emails

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,350
continual requests it's neither

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,580
repackaging information that takes time

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,360
from the people who need to do the

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,820
actual work and evaluations be flexible

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,310
with the data I know that when we do our

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,110
triage for the incoming CVS we ignore

00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,860
the version numbers we just go for

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,500
package names

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,960
that's enough resolution to be able to

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,880
filter a lot of data down and then we

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,830
can know if we're just not vulnerable if

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,320
we think we are least we cut cut

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:30,019
list but don't try to do every single

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,700
detail just D focus the information try

00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,169
to get the best to answer at that time

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,120
and move the data long so you can

00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:38,990
separate what you have to deal with with

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,600
you don't have to deal with provide

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,909
tools first C CB and flow triage and I

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,010
mentioned before this is a huge expense

00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:47,419
and you got to do better there's ways we

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,830
could help these people out you need to

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,049
start doing that I'll be showing some

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:55,039
ways to do that of course provide

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:57,320
management with NDA information so be

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,110
able to keep this essential but safe

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,230
storage user restrictions so just manage

00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:04,610
your compliance carefully and have tools

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,630
to help assist with that so you don't

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,620
have accidental crossover so we've been

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,360
dealing with this for quite a while

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,950
we've come to the pain point where we

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,809
got to do a solution and we come up with

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,480
this thing called ESR tool this is a key

00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:20,090
response tool and this solves many

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,850
problems for us and stress because all

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,789
of our really expensive experienced

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,440
engineers just end their time going do

00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:29,929
all this manual stuff I mentioned before

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,809
doing reports doing gathering and data

00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:34,340
doing we analysis trying to reintegrate

00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:37,730
information trying to pull together

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,289
information it's just too much and it

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,510
became too expensive so we came up with

00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,580
this and we're in fact sharing with the

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,370
open source we're promoting it at Yocto

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,899
project and to have the community join

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,909
with us and take advantage of this tool

00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:51,860
as well because it's not just us and

00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:53,090
we'd like to not spend our time working

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,830
on this problem we need to spend our

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:59,720
time on actually doing patches and fixes

00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:02,210
and servicing our customers so what is

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,950
to do well the list of things should

00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,360
look like very similar to the list of

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,700
best practices and that's how it was

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,470
designed to a really address the best

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,970
practices so it can do it for us we

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,909
don't spend the time doing it manually

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,799
on a nation it's got scripting to do all

00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:18,260
the data gathering going on both the

00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,179
sites to gather the data incremental e

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,130
it's got cron jobs we can make sure we

00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,809
do the right frequency so we don't have

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,610
to keep having a person press a button

00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:28,370
or anything or do it manually

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,200
easy access we have a provided a web

00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,970
interface so that people can really

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,270
easily walk the data just follow the

00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:37,460
links gather the information we have on

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,720
also being able to command line if we I

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,179
didn't invent some so

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,470
your question or answer in the GUI they

00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:44,659
could just write their own scripts to

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,080
query the database themselves data

00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:49,850
aggregation SQL did database that's

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,679
where all the data is integrated all

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,049
tied together and that way we can really

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,580
tie everything together and have

00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:57,530
everything know about everything else so

00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,130
everything is up-to-date consistent

00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:02,929
brought together data flexibility well

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,419
we just had to design that in and you'll

00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:08,510
be seeing some of that in there and you

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:10,039
can design more strict scripts we'd like

00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,870
to do analysis after we get some more

00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,169
experience with this but it's enough to

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:16,280
get us out the gate triage in flow I'll

00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,200
be showing some of the tools being

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,130
developed to help our engineers manage

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,770
the CVE triage finally NDA management we

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:27,080
have a ways to keep user lists so some

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,900
information can be tied to access lists

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,820
every person logged in so we also know

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,890
who everyone is and if they do a

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,140
transaction like add a record download a

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,760
file change the status we know

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,260
everything that's happened in have the

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,809
tool do that so we have a complete

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,840
history can do reports against it we can

00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:46,250
validate it we can enforce it and that

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,510
we could really control the NDA

00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,730
information an example of a page from

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,280
the tool you can see we have a mix of

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,640
products we have a mix of status

00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,460
we have defects we lisa sad the fix

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,049
thank goodness and so you can really see

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,929
everything's linked everything's tied

00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:08,570
together you can see this is one cv this

00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:10,549
is a one cv that we had to deal with and

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,710
it had different effect on different

00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:14,840
releases some are still working on then

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,809
maybe back ported it also shows at the

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,940
top we have our customer content

00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:21,409
management this is custom releases these

00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,090
are kind of in parallel they're not

00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:24,980
quite a release but kind of a release

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:27,049
but our system is flexible enough to

00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,370
have mixed data like that which is cross

00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,320
releases that we can actually keep

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,809
tracking stuff together with that so

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,909
this is a vulnerability again it's a

00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:37,669
cross or product it's a cross releases

00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:39,650
and we can then drill down to specific

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:40,280
releases so we can drill down to

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,770
specific

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,690
to the specific CVS and it's all

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,789
linkable and it's very very easy to find

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,500
information and you got special buttons

00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:49,940
not on this one but we port button up at

00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,980
the top so you click click a button and

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,419
do report do an export

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,990
and get the information quickly to you

00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:59,720
to go work with that so the object model

00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,789
just briefly data sources again this

00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,799
want to have as many data sources as

00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:06,200
could get your job done certainly for

00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:09,139
the CVE providers but also for your

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,299
defect system for your sustaining system

00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:13,159
for your management system whatever you

00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:14,840
need to do you can add data sources to

00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:17,600
make sure that you have all the data you

00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,730
need at your fingertips CV course

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,279
represents the upstream CVE with links

00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:25,429
and such vulnerability that is the

00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:27,289
vulnerability it may usually be one CV

00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:29,269
the vulnerability sometimes there's

00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:31,549
several CVS that actually add up to one

00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:32,929
available one vulnerability so that we

00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:35,539
can kind of grow through that into a

00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:37,519
problem and they have to cross products

00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:39,860
investigation is a word we came up with

00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,750
describe how we're going to resolve that

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,850
vulnerability for a particular release

00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,100
and with that will be the particular

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:49,039
defects that track that for that release

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:51,139
and the defect that's representation of

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,399
our defect system we use JIRA we're also

00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:56,659
adding a plug-in for bugzilla and

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,480
whatever system they have that we can

00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:01,370
represent integrate tie together pull

00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,260
push whatever you need to do with the

00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,419
defect system so you keep your CV ease

00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,100
the vulnerabilities and your defects all

00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:11,360
tied together with the data that you

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:13,789
gathered notifications if the status has

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,130
changed upstream the tools can see it

00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:18,080
the - we'll have a notification to the

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,779
manager that something has changed or

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,500
the defect status has changed why have

00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,840
your person

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,789
pull it have the notification come in

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,620
and tell people that way you can keep

00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:29,059
everything tied together and not how

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,320
people continue to look for it it will

00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:32,360
tell you when something's changed

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,889
there's something for you to do rather

00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,110
than wasting your time looking for stuff

00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:38,510
to do I brief outline for people like

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:41,269
pictures I like pictures how it all

00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:44,570
works together multiple sources try the

00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:46,580
laser over here you have the backend

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,950
scripts down here they're triggered by a

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,309
cron jobs one to every hour if you want

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:55,250
to keep your defects up to date once a

00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:57,380
day for the updated cds database all

00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:01,399
ties together SQL error can work with

00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,899
SQL be a web interface you already can

00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,600
do the custom data scripts to get your

00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:07,520
data out report scripts

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,210
of course out to your customers to your

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,860
management and you can then triage the

00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,450
data and send it to your public pasting

00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,790
database make sure it's clean and

00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:19,160
everything and separate for the besties

00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:22,070
everyday work information is stored in

00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,170
the CVE system or defect system and we

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,180
also have the place for the bulk data

00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,910
and also place you can download your

00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:31,850
files that are pertinent to specific

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,080
CVEs or vulnerabilities upload data so

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,180
you can barely easily share the

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,090
information between teams rather than

00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:42,320
having it kind of lost between systems

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:44,150
sir and I talked about the incoming CVE

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,740
this is one of the things when our

00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,900
primary goals was to have a tool to help

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:52,300
triage incoming CVEs

00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:55,220
well have you done is listen come back

00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,770
here we are all the incoming CDEs

00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,360
descriptions as you know them we have

00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,580
you can follow the link to see what

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,010
actually the full record is but here's

00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,110
the magic part our secret sauce we've

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,390
been doing this for 10 plus years we

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:10,520
have a lot of information about which

00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,230
keywords applied to CBS were vulnerable

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,850
to which keywords we have they're

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,120
applied to CDs were not vulnerable to

00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:19,340
we've taken that list and we applied it

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,960
filters against the information we have

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,450
in a CV you record that's coming in

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,980
there maybe only be the description so

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,440
we'll do a scan against Christian if

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,750
there is a CPE fields we'll scan against

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,460
that if we have information on downloads

00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,130
attachments we'll scan against that but

00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,810
we use that database of learn to

00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:38,690
knowledge about what applies what does

00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:40,430
not apply to scan pre scan the

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:44,000
information so when the engineer comes

00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:46,130
up to do stuff we'll give them reasons

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,320
for this is a vulnerability reasons

00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:50,960
against based on a little earned and

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,760
sometimes this is really all you can do

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,520
it's applying heuristics to the

00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,350
incomplete information of the CVS so

00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,690
that we can really quickly give guidance

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,970
to the engineer says well it's got

00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,700
certain keywords it's probably windows

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,890
or I thought keywords is Linux and just

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,380
we have a couple ten thousand keywords I

00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,940
think we have and so that way you can

00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,100
ply heuristics they're just a first step

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,510
but sometimes that's what all you need

00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,400
and then you can start pulling stuff off

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,290
you say okay everything is Windows

00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,540
doesn't apply to me

00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,640
do a search against all those select all

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,960
those mark dos is not vulnerable it's

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,880
out of the system you peeled away a

00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,160
couple hundred right there go to the

00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,350
next keyword that you probably is a not

00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,510
blonde pole to peel those away that we

00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,800
can peel away stuff in groups then you

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,360
could have the ones that you start

00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,250
looking at well we're definitely audible

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,170
to that the smart go is is vulnerable

00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,570
these are definitely need investigations

00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,970
this pull that group out so that we can

00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:46,250
really chop through the list divide

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,870
conquer and really get in into the right

00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,240
state so that your next level of

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,640
engineers can start working with it so

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,350
that's how you've been applying our

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,840
information to try to make that job that

00:33:54,350 --> 00:34:00,370
very expensive job easier and safer for

00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,940
us so next steps is under development

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,310
come join us

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,170
we have an open source we have a forum

00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:08,570
there's a community page at yalta

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,610
project about the status of the thing

00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,260
how to install it how to run it the

00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,740
design is modular so it's very easy for

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,320
you to add your own data sources and

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:21,350
imply to implement your business rules

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,750
against the data your own reports your

00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,310
own agile system your own management

00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,730
system your own compliance system

00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:31,340
whatever you need to do is very modular

00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:34,040
purposely and in conclusion lot of

00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,899
information out there thankfully with

00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,790
knowledge awareness adaptability

00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:39,139
automation we can manage the struggle

00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,260
because it is a struggle an everyday

00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:44,540
struggle but we can manage it and keep a

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,700
lot not losing money on that we need to

00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,649
spend people's time on the actual

00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,360
problems and not the process so let's

00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:52,820
let's have tools help us with the

00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,740
process and get on with it and links to

00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,590
learn more there's we have a mailing

00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:59,690
list of your project on security we have

00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,310
myself I work for Wind River where the

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,800
ones could contribute at this I'm the

00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,270
maintainer and you come to the Yocto

00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,470
project booth you can see a live demo of

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,240
the tool and see how it really

00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:14,080
integrates together how could work baby

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,080
for you so that is my talk so questions

00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,250
[Applause]

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,870
[Music]

00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,520
my lovely assistant has a microphone

00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:28,690
anyone that like to ask her a question

00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,690
oh you'll make her run the whole way I

00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:38,750
will come to you but I have to say on

00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:41,950
the stage okay I suspect when setting up

00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:44,810
s our tool you have to tell it what

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:47,120
software you are using yourself so can

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,430
you pick up pick them up from the GUI or

00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,530
choose from a list of babies or the

00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:54,050
vulnerabilities that are disclosed and

00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,910
we are using these on this or how do you

00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,430
do it so what we've done is we've given

00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,530
you our list of keywords or ten years

00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,450
experience to get out of the gate or we

00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,220
have waste you can add to that keyless

00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,140
word ways to remove stuff in the key

00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,180
list word we don't know your product yet

00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,860
we don't know we're kind of you want to

00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,810
move into the world we have our own CPEs

00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,040
internally for it the products are with

00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,750
actually they're gonna be lists the

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,250
package lists and all that we haven't

00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:19,310
implemented that yet so we're just using

00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:20,540
the heuristics right now so I'm but

00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:23,150
that'd be easy something to eat to the

00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,370
answer easy to apply easy to bring in so

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,600
if you have we can work together we can

00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:28,880
make it happen

00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,590
but yeah we we know about our problems

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,870
we don't know about your province so

00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,990
that's why you made a modular to make it

00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:37,760
adaptable so yeah so work with me so I

00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,380
get a little implement something for you

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,350
to make you happy because I'm sure will

00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,390
help us two more questions

00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:46,390
ah one over here

00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:57,779
so how the system help me figure out

00:36:55,109 --> 00:37:00,299
like a patch that arrives after the CV

00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:03,900
longer and doesn't have any reference to

00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:09,239
the CV fixes soda for the examples you

00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:11,339
gave so if it came from a data source

00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:14,009
that you're aware of you can still be

00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:19,079
pulling that data source for updates if

00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:20,670
they came from a more ad-hoc forum or an

00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,859
email list or some mail from your

00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,410
brother you could enter it into the

00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:27,809
system I can't answer that because it

00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,819
takes vigilance to find that stuff but

00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:31,890
you if you can find it with the tools if

00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:34,410
it's at a place that's a meaningful to

00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:36,450
access any one of these aggregation

00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,729
sites or host sites you can have tools

00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,410
that will look for that if you can find

00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:42,210
other ways you can easily attach that

00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,339
kind of metadata because we know that no

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,960
system is purpose or complete so we made

00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:48,329
it so that's very easy to attach stuff

00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,819
that you do find out after the fact I'm

00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,809
not sure I'm answering your question but

00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:53,700
that's how we're approaching it right

00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:56,309
now because there's no good answer for

00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,309
that so I'll just mention that you can

00:37:56,309 --> 00:38:00,779
create your own events in the system

00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,670
like receive ease they do not exist yet

00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:04,440
or internal things that you know this is

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,150
a problem I don't know where this you

00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,559
can create those and if it see if he

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,450
does exist you could then promote it to

00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:11,039
the actual CBE so you have ways to be

00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,049
flexible with that so again you have to

00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,729
be flexible with the data okay it's in

00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:17,999
perfect world yes thank you

00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:20,910
question did I understand correctly that

00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:23,400
all this tooling is about filtering the

00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,739
the information in the CVS and the

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,239
second step when thinking about a bill

00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,430
from the York to project where all these

00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:33,630
projects are configured features

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:35,519
configured away let's let's left for

00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,739
this investigation or is there something

00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,089
to help with this this part of the

00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:41,670
problem that's the next thing for me to

00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:43,289
do that is the next thing because we

00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,729
know from our bills from the recipes

00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:46,410
from the bailed out list from the auto

00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:49,650
builder every night we know what's in

00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:52,499
the system so be able to match it up if

00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,049
you have enough CPU information so we

00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:57,299
certainly can have their internal CBE's

00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:58,529
CPEs about the product from our builds

00:38:57,299 --> 00:39:00,569
we can gather that that's pretty easy

00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:02,440
the versioning what's in there what's in

00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:04,990
that particular configuration

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,900
to match against CVEs that may have the

00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,819
zero CPE stuff so that we have all okay

00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,160
it's bash that's all we know for now

00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:15,369
and so it's imperfect as this gets

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,200
better the matches can be better so um I

00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:19,089
have not implemented that yet because

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,280
right now I'm just trying to get my my

00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:23,380
my number one priority is to get the

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,359
engineer who's triaging stop happy and

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,390
everything so that'd be my next step to

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:31,359
implement okay does that mean for

00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:34,030
example if we put Samba on in on a

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,550
product and we configure away the domain

00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:39,400
controller features and we get a

00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:41,410
vulnerability against Samba that will it

00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,810
detect that we are not vulnerable

00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:47,319
because we configured away the domain

00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:50,890
controllers controller stuff so if you

00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:53,050
have a list so the quick answer is yes

00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,640
you can do that maybe not today but yes

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,770
because you have your you know that what

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,319
you're vulnerable to Samba so certainly

00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,510
we have a whole idea of meta words that

00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,220
attach to everything so even if the CVE

00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:05,109
doesn't say samba but you know affects

00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,730
samba you can have keywords that match

00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:08,770
that so that you can have that extra

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,900
reference if the cps are not completely

00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,400
accurate so yes there's ways to match it

00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,380
against the TPS or the keywords that

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,630
your engineer has said this is really

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,940
samba and it can match okay this product

00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:21,790
a is samba this one it's not this one

00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,260
maybe so yes you can match that I have

00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,849
not I'm offended that implemented that

00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,410
yet but yes that's completely within the

00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:34,060
scope of the system in the design of the

00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:36,599
system and the goal of the system any

00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,599
more questions

00:40:37,499 --> 00:40:40,410
three-two-one it's a wrap thank you very

00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:43,060
much

00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,060
