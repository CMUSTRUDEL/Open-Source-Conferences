	Keeping Up With The Joneses (CVEs) - David Reyna, Wind River Systems

Keeping up to date with security issues once a product has been released isn’t as easy as it first seems. There’s a well-known database of all security issues hosted by MITRE, but the data isn’t reliable enough to be trusted blindly. You could upgrade to the latest release of every software package you ship, but packages may be unmaintained or introduce new bugs. There is essentially no silver bullet for the problem of security updates.

In this presentation, we will explain why the obvious solutions are flawed, what the alternatives are, how best practises can be shared to reduce the time between fix announcement and deployment, and discuss how best to handle keeping up to date with security issues.
