	Networking: From the Ethernet MAC to the Link Partner - Maxime Chevallier & Antoine Ténart, Bootlin

In the network world, the link between the Ethernet MAC controller and the network media has become more complex. PHYs can now be chained, located in SFP modules and parts of the link are now hot-pluggable.

All the components of the link communicate using a wide range of standards such as RGMII, SGMII, QSGMII, 1000BASE-X, 1000BASE-T or 10GKR, and one easily gets lost.

In this talk, we'll dive into these technologies and cover how Linux represents the link between the MAC and the link partner, with infrastructures such as phylink.

We'll also give an overview of what composes the link and the standards used.
