Description: 
	Linux and Zephyr “Talking” to Each Other in the Same SoC - Diego Sueiro, Sepura / Embarcados

 SoC vendors are launching Hybrid Multiprocessors (HMP) architectures where one or more cores deal with the end-user application and other cores implement specific features. Instead of battling with Linux Kernel to meet the real-time constraints, you can defer the “dirty” work to a microcontroller in an isolated and controlled environment and it is where Zephyr excels.

It is important that hybrid cores communicate with each other to meet the application requirements. The RPMsg can be used in these kinds of arrangements exposing an API independent of the underlying inter-core communication.

In this presentation, Diego Sueiro will talk about how Linux and Zephyr can share data using RPMsg, initialization flow, and configurations needed to enable its communication.

Main topics of this session:

    Real-Time applications with HMP
    RPMsg on Linux
    Enabling RPMsg-lite on Zephyr
    Demo
    Future work
