	Device Security in IoT - Ashutosh Singh, Arm Ltd

Device security is becoming increasingly complex and expensive with exponential growth in connected devices. E.g. Devices must support secure boot to prevent malicious software installation
Communication must be secure and trusted to protect data and infrastructure Compartmentalisation in device software scope limit software vulnerabilities. 

This talk covers security considerations across various scenarios and how they apply to software/hardware specs using "Trusted Firmware for M" as reference.
Introductory level details of the Platform Security Architecture(PSA) are covered as well.
 
Presentation Structure:
Discussion about some of the use-cases and device states and associated security implications
Breaking it down: Common device security principles
Introduction to Trusted Firmware for M and PSA
Hardware and software architecture of a connected device
Questions
