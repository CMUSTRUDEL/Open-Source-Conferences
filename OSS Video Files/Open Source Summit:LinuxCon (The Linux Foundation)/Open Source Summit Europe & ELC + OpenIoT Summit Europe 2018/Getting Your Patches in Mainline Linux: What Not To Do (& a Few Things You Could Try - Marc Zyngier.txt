	Getting Your Patches in Mainline Linux: What Not To Do (and a Few Things You Could Try Instead) - Marc Zyngier, ARM

You've worked hard to develop a new feature, fix a tricky problem, or clean up an unloved part of the kernel. You have posted the patches on the relevant mailing lists and yet can't manage to get them merged. You can't get them past the maintainers, and maybe not even manage to attract their interest. What is happening?

Getting patches into the mainline Linux tree can be a tricky thing, especially for newcomers. The kernel does carry a long description of the process of writing and submitting the patches, but doesn't actually describe the complex set of interactions that take place between the submitter and the maintainer, and how trust gets build between the two.

This talks proposes to detail these interactions, and to offer the point of view of a contributor that grew into a maintainer, giving a number of examples of what not to do, and what you could try doing
instead. 

About Marc Zyngier
Marc has been working on the Linux kernel since an unexpected encounter with 0.99pl13 in 1993. His first contribution was merged in 1996 in the form of the original version of the MD driver.

Having played with fault tolerant systems at Bull, worked on exotic (and ultimately doomed) CPU architectures at Texas Instruments, and had fun with consumer electronics at TomTom, he has been with ARM since 2010, where he focusses on the Linux kernel, co-maintaining KVM/arm and some parts of the IRQ subsystem. He is also involved in some new aspects of the ARM architecture.

He has presented a number of talks at Linux Plumbers, ELC, and KVM Forum over the past years.
