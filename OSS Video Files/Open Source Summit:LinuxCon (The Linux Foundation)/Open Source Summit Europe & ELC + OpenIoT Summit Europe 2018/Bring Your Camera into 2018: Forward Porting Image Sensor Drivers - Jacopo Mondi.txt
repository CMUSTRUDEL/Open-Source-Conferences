	Bring Your Camera into 2018: Forward Porting Image Sensor Drivers - Jacopo Mondi, Renesas
embedded linux conference

The Linux media community tried in the past to ease the work of camera driver developers by providing frameworks and methods to abstract away from the crude V4L2 APIs. Some of those frameworks, as the 'soc_camera' one, have served their purpose so well they are often found in most BSPs and non-mainline camera drivers.

In the forthcoming Linux kernel releases said framework will be obsoleted, and developers of BSPs and downstream kernels will find themselves in the need to port their existing drivers. This presentation aims to provide them an overview on how to better do that while presenting how sensor drivers are expected to evolve as the hardware complexity image capture subsystems in embedded devices keep increasing year after year. 

About Jacopo Mondi
Jacopo is software engineer with a passion for embedded, operating systems and free software. In the last 5 years he collected development experiences on mobile and industrial grade devices based on different system on chips and platforms, mostly working on integrating video and graphics peripherals on Linux based platforms.

He has recently started contributing regularly to the Linux kernel after joining the Renesas upstream kernel team in late 2016, enjoying the opportunity to work closely with the kernel development community.

He presented at FOSDEM, LinuxLab and local free software related events.
