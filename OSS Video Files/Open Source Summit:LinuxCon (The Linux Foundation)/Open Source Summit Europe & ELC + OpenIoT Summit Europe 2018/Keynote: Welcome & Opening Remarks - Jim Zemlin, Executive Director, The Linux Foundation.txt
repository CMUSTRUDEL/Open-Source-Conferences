welcome to wonderful Scotland

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,779

we're complaining about the weather to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,420
mean which I thought was ridiculous but

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,910
you know what I was told is you have to

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,849
get one of these jumpers which is what

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,130
they call sweaters over here but you get

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,050
a jumper it helps you with the weather

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,910
so I very much good this is a hundred

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:40,379
percent Scottish wool I've got on right

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,930
now but we're very excited to be here I

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,899
first want to thank our diamond sponsors

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,460
Intel and Microsoft for helping us make

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:54,300
this events possible let's give a hand

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:56,370
to those folks yeah we also have just an

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,050
amazing amount of content this week you

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,030
know one of the great things about this

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,370
event is over the course of several days

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,559
you're going to be able to go to a wide

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,280
variety of very deep technical sessions

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,229
sessions on all kinds of topics and we

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,630
have a program committee and a set of

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,770
tracked chairs that help make that

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,920
happen maybe 10 years ago i recused

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,380
myself from any kind of selection

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,020
committee for conference talks because

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,570
if I was in charge of the conference

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,610
talks this event would not be 3-4 days

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,320
it would be like four weeks because I

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,930
would just accept every single talk

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,210
they're so amazing but I want to thank

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,860
me throughout Donny Berger Holtz Greg

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,020
Crowe Hartman timbered Kate Stewart

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,090
Johnno bacon Bryan Liles Robyn Bergeron

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,320
and Frank Roy who helped put all this

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,909
together let's give them a big hand I

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,560
see Tim right

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:52,590
there jonno somewhere out there it's a

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,319
lot of work I also want to take a moment

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,179
to call out our diversity and inclusion

00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,670
initiatives that we have here at the

00:01:57,179 --> 00:02:01,170
event so you know one of the things that

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,390
we're trying to do within our

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,250
communities is the Linux Foundation

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,569
believes that diverse communities are

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,869
the best communities and there's like

00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:12,780
reams of scientific research and studies

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,569
that approve this to be true and to that

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,910
end we are trying to encourage more of

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,340
that in opens not just our communities

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,230
but in all open-source communities so

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,900
we've created a diversity empowerment

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,750
summit with three days of talks here

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,060
covering a wide range of topics so I

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,980
encourage folks to get involved in that

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,769
and help make our community stronger and

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,950
better we also have a women in

00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,870
open-source lunch a diversity social

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,390
which was last night so I want to thank

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,519
all of you who attended that we also

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,440
have free childcare at all of our events

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,290
how many people bring their kids to

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,180
Linux foundation events anyone anyone

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,400
there we go we got one one guy so I

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,440
always bring my daughter when she's not

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,930
attending school she's ten years old I

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,819
do bring her to our events and many of

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,739
you have met her but I really encourage

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,840
all of you to take advantage of this we

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,010
want to make these events

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,599
family-friendly especially for ones in

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,849
the summer are open source North America

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,419
events once in China and Japan bring

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,150
your kids

00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:17,910
we have coding workshops for them at our

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,160
last event in Vancouver even leanest

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,109
Torvalds stop by met the kids gave them

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,639
some tips on coding so it's something

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,560
that I think is really a great

00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,870
opportunity and again totally free for

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,880
all attendees including childcare at the

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,530
evening events as well so you don't feel

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,060
like you you don't have to duck out and

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,220
miss out on the social event as well

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,120
we'll help take care of you on that as

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,069
well

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,620
we have nursing rooms communication and

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:44,190
pronoun stickers much more check out our

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,440
event signage and the programs to

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,349
understand what we've got there

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,900
so finally we also have a strict code of

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:54,990
conduct here if anyone is concerned

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,090
please approach our event staff at

00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,160
we have a policy about how we handle

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,680
those things as well we'll dress them

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,320
right away so with that I'd like to

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,600
spend a few minutes talking about what

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,550
the Linux Foundation is working on I'd

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,470
give you an update about kind of how

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,660
we're seeing things in the world and

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,760
then introduce our speakers for today

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,400
we're going to talk about a wide range

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,010
of topics from new open source

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,550
initiatives to legal matters and so

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,680
forth but you know in 2018 open source

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,900
continues to just make a big impact the

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,210
fact that we have so many people at this

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,400
event in Europe I think as a testimony

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,470
to that this year at Linux foundation

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,660
events all over the world from Asia to

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,500
Europe to North America we will have

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:43,050
over 35,000 attendees across all of our

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,360
events it's just amazing to see the

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,180
number of people who participate and

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,300
obviously Linux continues to grow and

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,400
has now become the most important

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,650
software platform out really in the

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,290
history of computing it's just amazing

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,800
and is a testimony to how powerful the

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,200
concept of open source is that Linux now

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,300
represents in some markets literally 100

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,800
percent market share up from you know

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,790
zero not that long ago as history goes

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,560
but today you know one of the things

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,840
that I wanted to talk about briefly is

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,390
how the Linux Foundation itself is much

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,630
more than just Linux many of you are

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,720
here today to participate in tracks and

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,270
initiatives that are either built on top

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
of Linux or things that aren't even

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,410
related to Linux itself but run on

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,810
multiple platforms you know we have

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,880
initiatives around cybersecurity how

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,680
many people here knew that the Linux

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,690
Foundation's let's encrypt project is

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,820
the biggest certificate authority in the

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,080
world I'm gonna cool me that how many

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,960
people here have actually used let's

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,030
encrypt that is awesome that's so good

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,590
to see so app get let's encrypt

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,440
hopefully it's just that easy

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,830
the idea here is to make TLS sort of the

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,870
de-facto for the web and that's going to

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,930
make our lives more secure that's going

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,950
to make our privacy better we also have

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,770
our core infrastructure initiative

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,270
that's helping to find critical open

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,550
source projects that are important to

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,620
society and help

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,050
improve their application security in

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,510
the networking sector we have projects

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,820
that are helping automate the next

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,650
generation of global service providers

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,870
networks getting ready for 5g

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,120
deployments in cloud computing has

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,970
anyone heard of kubernetes the

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,430
kubernetes it's a thing and it's not

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,170
just kubernetes we have Cloud Foundry at

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,390
the Linux Foundation which is getting

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,120
incredible traction in enterprise

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,790
computing and then CN CF has its entire

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,520
family of companies that are around it

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,980
making solutions for other cloud in

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,390
automotive our automotive grade Linux

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,370
initiative which was started years ago

00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,350
is now in millions of production

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,040
automobiles it's the in vehicle

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,510
experience for many many vehicles

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,700
Daimler Chrysler commercial vans here in

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,150
Europe Toyota automobiles throughout the

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,860
world we have initiatives in blockchain

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:02,570
our hyper ledger initiative is sort of

00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,160
think of this as Bitcoin without the

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,810
Bitcoin so it's a non cryptocurrency

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,420
blockchain initiative that's being

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,880
deployed in supply chain management it's

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,100
used for the tracking the diamond supply

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,990
chain in the Kimberley process to root

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,090
out blood diamonds as they enter the

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,280
system in the diamond supply chain it's

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,500
used in financial services it's used by

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,150
one of the biggest financial healthcare

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,810
companies in the United States and many

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,660
many more

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,190
we have efforts in edge computing Zephir

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,140
I want to give a shout out to this is an

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,540
artists project that we have there's

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,060
tracks on Zephyr here today the Yocto

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,860
project is being used as well but

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,440
basically one of the de facto embedded

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,540
build tools for Linux in embedded

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,240
systems and then in the web how many

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,310
people here have ever used node a few no

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,070
js' all right it's all good so we're

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,110
really expanding beyond that and we've

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,820
been growing an amazing amount this year

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,280
and again I think this is testimony to

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,890
how fast open-source is growing today we

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,270
have over thirteen hundred members

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,560
thousands of developers tens of

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,440
thousands developers contributing these

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,510
projects creating a ton of value in 2018

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,850
were we continue to this day to add a

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,310
new member of the Linux Foundation every

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,860
single day what that means for all of

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,390
you is that as you come in and

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,160
participate in our projects and

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,110
contribute code to them and use them to

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,700
create products and services we're going

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,380
to be able to match you with other

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,300
companies and organizations who want

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,240
work on the same thing with your

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,160
organization together and you know open

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,840
source writ large beyond the Linux

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,200
Foundation continues to grow and

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,150
accelerate on I think this this actually

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,690
is probably dated I think there are now

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:41,240
about 78 million repositories on github

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,099
today just thousands of projects being

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,020
created tens of thousands of new

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,900
versions being created every single day

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,910
you know open source is just such a

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,490
critical part of how things get built

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:56,000
and the best way for I think everyone to

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,060
explain this to their friends to their

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,250
family is to think about when people say

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,080
why is this open source so important to

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,490
describe how today when you make any

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,070
kind of application it's kind of like

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,830
making a sandwich I think of it as an

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,960
open-source sandwich where you know you

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,030
choose a framework kind of at the bottom

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,700
layer this could be no js' react you

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,740
name it you then write some custom code

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,450
to build that application for whatever

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,650
you want to do maybe to automate

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,010
something or gonna create a web

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,740
application you then go and use a whole

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,170
variety of I'll choose among tens of

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,940
thousands of open-source libraries that

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,260
have kind of already solved the problem

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,090
that you've been trying to solve to

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,690
enable your particular application and

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:42,170
what you get in this sandwich is most of

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,820
the code is open source like this is

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,250
really what we continue to see at the

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,680
Linux Foundation is the vast majority of

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,680
actual code in any software product or

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,480
service continues to be open source the

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,640
key is for all of us to think about is

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,280
that 10% the stuff that matters to your

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,470
customers your users or to you is really

00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,120
the most important code right because

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,640
that's the code that really is solving

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,260
the problem you need to solve and it

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,970
would be insane to go and try and

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,860
recreate the entire sandwich from

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,290
scratch by yourself that's why

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:16,040
open-source is so important now what's

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:18,650
important in this context is that at

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,410
those layers of open source that you're

00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,970
utilizing to create your application

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:26,180
that you have code that you can actually

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,100
count on for a long period of time that

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,780
that code is released at a regular

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,760
cadence that there's a degree of

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,010
application security that you can rely

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,670
on for that code that you know that the

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,160
code will be

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,290
maintaining up-to-date and that is

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,190
really what the focus of the Linux

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:46,010
Foundation is to do what we do is we

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,900
work with all of our communities the the

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,000
projects that really matter to building

00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,950
a lot of the modern infrastructure that

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,200
runs you know societies you know

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:57,020
automotive systems or financial sector

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,660
and help make them sustainable over long

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,610
periods of time our job is really to

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,590
focus on the upstream open source

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,260
projects that you're all here to talk

00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,210
about today you know how do we enable

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,100
those communities to succeed bring

00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,740
developers together at events like this

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,540
to accelerate the development make sure

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,700
that the legal frameworks that govern

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,010
the intellectual property are clean can

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,350
be counted on and what happens is if

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,170
those upstream projects are really good

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,060
then people who are members of the

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,160
foundation or people who aren't members

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,840
there's no requirement take that code

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,780
and they create commercial products and

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,330
services it could be a mobile device an

00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:38,300
automobile system it could be a

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,790
financial application you name it but

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,730
they basically take that code and create

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,380
products of services right government

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,900
institutions could use the code to

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,960
create tools to make more transparent

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,120
governance right to improve the

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,080
productivity maybe of that particular

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,240
Society

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,910
but see when you take that code and you

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,320
create a product service what we also

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,060
hope help hope happens is that the

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,770
companies who are offering those

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,530
products and services can create some

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,960
profit for themselves and others and

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,810
what's key here is when you are able to

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,420
have people leveraging open source

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:19,880
capture value for themselves what we've

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,390
seen now over a very long period of time

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,540
more than you know 20 years is that some

00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,400
of that value that's captured through

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,390
the profits for creating these products

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,800
or services or maybe through

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,080
government's who have better more

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,620
efficient governments gets reinvested

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,360
back into the project largely in the

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,930
form of developers like many of you here

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,460
who continue to contribute to that

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,070
collective project to the Commons

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,470
because you don't want to maintain all

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,510
of this source code by yourself right

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,450
that 90% of the code that just you know

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:56,030
is shared and rightfully should and then

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,100
you get better projects you get better

00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,320
products as a result the next release

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,690
the next product you build begets more

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,390
profit and value begets better projects

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,970
better products more profit and you have

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,340
this sustainable economic positive

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,100
feedback loop this is really the trick

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,200
to open source I get asked this question

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,330
all the time well if open source

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,780
software is free how can anybody make

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:23,930
money off of it and this is the answer

00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:26,360
when you have organizations companies be

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,700
able to take this code build an Android

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,890
device create a web application make

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,320
some money off it then reinvest it is

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,960
the definition of being able to help

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,670
others while you help yourself at the

00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,060
same time and we think that's really

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:43,730
important and what really makes this

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,560
positive feedback loop spin fast it's

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,480
not just bringing one developer at a

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,800
time into our projects just with

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,690
something that I think we all try to do

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,490
as good stewards of open source projects

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:54,980
but at the foundation what we're seeing

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,160
is a new trend where wholesale

00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,040
industries are starting to realize just

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,820
how powerful open source can be to help

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,620
them improve their entire industry and I

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,380
want to give you a few examples of what

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,870
that looks like about a month and a half

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,530
ago we announced at our open source

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,690
American

00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,490
open source of North America event the

00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,720
Academy Software Foundation how many

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,540
people here have heard of the motion

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,830
efficient big picture Academy so I mean

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,090
how many of the Oscars

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,530
everyone heard of the Oscars right there

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,570
the this that the Motion Picture Academy

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,840
is the home of the Oscars but in

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,520
addition to the Oscars they also are in

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,500
charge of the science and technology

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,160
that helps make motion pictures and

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,690
today almost all of the profits in the

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,660
motion picture industry the film

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:45,410
industry whether it's avatar or Star

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:49,670
Wars or you name it comes from computer

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:51,980
graphics comes from CGI films and

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,230
special effects literally like the first

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,410
hundred and thirty eight most profitable

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,870
movies ever all were animation and

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,100
computer graphics driven you have to get

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,019
all the way to 138

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,339
to get to an actual live-action movie

00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:12,139
where there was high profitability

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:15,779
Mamma Mia was the 138th most profitable

00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:20,699
but what the the Academy and companies

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:22,889
like DreamWorks Disney Google Intel side

00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:25,170
effects studios all these organizations

00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,019
decided is for the production pipeline

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,050
software that we all use we want to

00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,730
collectively develop this in open source

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,009
because we're not in the soft the

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:37,500
technology industry per se we're all in

00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:39,630
the storytelling industry and if we all

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,850
collectively work in open source on this

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,370
production pipeline software we're gonna

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,899
be able to move faster and the result

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:50,130
for all of you is going to be better

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,660
movies the CTO of Lucas films and

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,630
president of Industrial Light and Magic

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,209
even went so far to say like this is

00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:00,240
where in the film industry we're gonna

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:01,709
go find talent for software so if you

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
want to get your foot in the door in

00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:06,120
industrial light magic or work on the

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,000
next Star Wars film go work on this

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,329
project and that's really gonna be your

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,389
resume and entree into that world it's a

00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,189
pretty powerful thing in

00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,660
telecommunications the Linux Foundation

00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:21,630
worked with some of the biggest

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,910
operators in the world AT&T and China

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,759
Mobile to get together to solve a

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,980
problem to automate their networks today

00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,170
a modern telecommunication network with

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,410
5g coming in has so many devices

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,810
connecting to it so much data that in

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,610
order to meet the demand these service

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,829
providers you know China Mobile as an

00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,300
example which has 850 million

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,550
subscribers that's just people

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,490
connecting to their network they need to

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:49,730
automate their network and these

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,899
carriers decided to do it in open source

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,209
they thought they could get to market

00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,399
faster create better innovation better

00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:58,709
automation through our open network

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,509
automation platform and today they're

00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,699
doing it this has already been released

00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:04,559
it's in production and several operators

00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,419
who are now saving billions of dollars

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,270
on their production infrastructure that

00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:12,659
runs our modern communication networks

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:14,549
in the auto sector we worked with about

00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:15,070
a dozen of the world's largest car

00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:19,900
makers

00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:22,120
to help them compete with the navigation

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,750
and entertainment experience in the car

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,640
which was rapidly moving to you know an

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,740
Android or iPhone device that people

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,020
would just put the velcro onto the

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,700
dashboard right car companies didn't

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,320
have a lot of software experience and

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,540
they decided to get together in

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,270
open-source to create that in vehicle

00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,670
experience again today this is in 20

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,440
million production automobiles and it's

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,960
really helping raise the bar for the

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,410
automotive experience in this next

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,930
coming rounds of new cars you are going

00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,360
to see a dramatic increase in innovation

00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:59,380
and a much better experience for a

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:03,010
modern automobile and obviously cloud

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,860
native computing is is a new paradigm

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,440
for how applications get developed

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:12,100
Google approached us about three years

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:15,010
ago and said listen we want to show the

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,710
world by giving them technology we used

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,110
to run Google a better way to build

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,420
cloud applications and that technology

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,430
we're gonna call it kubernetes and it

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,220
makes it a lot easier to embrace the

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,520
whole DevOps container and micro service

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,110
movement by providing a consistent

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,080
management layer that's consistent way

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,360
to deploy containers and we want the

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,970
entire industry to essentially take that

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,500
on as a de-facto standard and so at the

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,930
Linux Foundation what we did was we went

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,060
out and did it and today there are now

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,380
over 300 members this is a little out of

00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,800
date of the cloud native computing

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,630
foundation 53 kubernetes certified

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,250
implementations service providers all

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,320
over the world all the top cloud

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,660
providers have this so you can be

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,030
assured that when you use container

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:04,270
technology like kubernetes provides you

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,860
a level of portability across different

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,480
implementations whether it's through

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,550
your own infrastructure or through a

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,170
public cloud service provider something

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,540
that the computer industry has been

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,870
trying to work on for years and years

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,720
and years so what you can see here is

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,120
several examples of we where we worked

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,340
with wholesale industries to create open

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,480
source projects but the question now is

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:32,590
where are we going to go from here and

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,620
energy is the next big sector that the

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,780
Linux Foundation is going after we are

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,690
working with a variety of partners in

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,180
the energy and utility industry and I

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,520
would like to introduce the person who

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,860
is working on our energy effort today

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,420
surely to the stage to talk about this

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,660
exciting new metric please welcome Julie

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,660
