	Teaching your Test Framework to Speak LAVA - Tim Orling, Intel Corporation

You already have tests, and you want to use LAVA, the popular automated test automation framework. Now you have to rewrite them to work in LAVA? Instead, teach your testing framework to output the signals LAVA understands to get more benefit from the LAVA dashboard. A simple technique transforms a one-line “pass/fail” result for your entire test suite into individual test case results. This enables the use of queries and charts built-in to the LAVA dashboard. We will show examples of how to do this in several unit testing frameworks, such as pytest, unittest, and BATS.
