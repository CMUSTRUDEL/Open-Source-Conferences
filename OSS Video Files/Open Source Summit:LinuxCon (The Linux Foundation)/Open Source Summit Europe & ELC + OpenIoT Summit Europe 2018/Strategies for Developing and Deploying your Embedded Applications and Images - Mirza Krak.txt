Description: 
	Strategies for Developing and Deploying your Embedded Applications and Images - Mirza Krak, Mender.io

We will delve into multiple strategies you can use for developing and deploying code to embedded devices. We will compare and contrast the following:

Lightweight package managers: ipkg/opkg
Desktop package managers: rpm/deb
Configuration Management Tools
Smart Package Manager
Yocto Runtime Package Management
PXE boot
OTA updaters: Mender


As with any decision, it is rarely black-and-white and we will cover some of the benefits and the limitations of all the different methods mentioned, to make sure you have the most critical information needed to decide for yourself whether a given strategy would be a good fit for your embedded application development.

This talk will cover how different mechanisms are implemented in the real world and how choosing the right strategy, understanding its benefits and drawbacks, can speed up and improve the whole development process.
