	Common Attacks on IoT Devices - Christina Quast

The importance of securing embedded devices has become clear to the whole industry as they started to play a bigger role in our daily lives in recent years. Up to now, it has been easy to compromise IoT devices such as vacuum robot, IP cameras, smart home devices, etc.

In the early days of IoT, attackers could often succeed without having physical access to the device.
By now more and more OEMs took steps to improve the defenses of their devices, which in turn has led the attackers to improve their strategies. Among others, the possession of a potential target is often times a necessity for a feasible attack.

This talk will shed light on the landscape of recent attacks on IoT devices. This enables the discussion of common pitfalls in designing embedded systems in order to raise awareness for this topic.
