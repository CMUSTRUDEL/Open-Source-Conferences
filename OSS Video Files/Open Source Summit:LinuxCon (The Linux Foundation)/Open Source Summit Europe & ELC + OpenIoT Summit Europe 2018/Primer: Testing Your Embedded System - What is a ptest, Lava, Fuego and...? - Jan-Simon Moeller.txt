	Primer: Testing Your Embedded System - What is a ptest, Lava, Fuego, KernelCI and...? - Jan-Simon Moeller, The Linux Foundation

This talk will introduce multiple frameworks available to test your Embedded Linux System and compare the use-cases . E.g. if you use the Yocto Project this talk introduces the ptest framework for recipes shipping their own unit tests/test suite. Fuego is introduced as a solution for complex test suites like LTP. Also introduced will be Lava as framework to manage your board farm and schedule tests on them. We'll also review the current developments and introduce the latest work (e.g. labgrid, Libvirt/R4D).
