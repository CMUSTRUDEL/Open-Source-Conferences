	Our Experiences Deploying Kubernetes with IPv6 - André Martins, Covalent IO

IPv6 will turn 20 years old in 2018, IPv4 addresses are nearly extinct, it is time to give IPv6 a real chance. This talk will cover the process of deploying Kubernetes with IPv6 step by step. We will discuss the current state of IPv6 in Kubernetes and all related components and list what is left to be done. We will walk through the deployment step by step in a easy to follow demo where questions can be asked. This talk will give a chance to learn more about Kubernetes networking and how IPv6 will enable to scale public addressing inside your Kubernetes cluster.
