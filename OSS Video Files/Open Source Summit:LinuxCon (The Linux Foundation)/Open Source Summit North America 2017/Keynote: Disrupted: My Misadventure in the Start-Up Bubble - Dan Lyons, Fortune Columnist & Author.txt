	Keynote: Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble - Dan Lyons, Fortune Columnist & Author

For twenty-five years Dan Lyons was a magazine writer at the top of his profession -- until one Friday morning he received a phone call and learned that his job at Newsweek no longer existed. An idea hit: Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley, but now maybe he should get in on the action. HubSpot, a hot startup in Boston, offered Dan a pile of stock options and the chance to pursue his start-up dream. What could go wrong? In a word, everything. In this talk Dan tells the tale of his less-than-triumphant attempt to start a new career in his fifties -- and shares a few thoughts about what's gone wrong with the tech industry during the second dotcom bubble.

About Dan Lyons
I'm anxious to catch up with old friends and to make new ones. I'm very excited about the summit.
