	Keynote: Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble - Dan Lyons, Fortune Columnist & Author

For twenty-five years Dan Lyons was a magazine writer at the top of his profession -- until one Friday morning he received a phone call and learned that his job at Newsweek no longer existed. An idea hit: Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley, but now maybe he should get in on the action. HubSpot, a hot startup in Boston, offered Dan a pile of stock options and the chance to pursue his start-up dream. What could go wrong? In a word, everything. In this talk Dan tells the tale of his less-than-triumphant attempt to start a new career in his fifties -- and shares a few thoughts about what's gone wrong with the tech industry during the second dotcom bubble.

About Dan Lyons
I'm anxious to catch up with old friends and to make new ones. I'm very excited about the summit.

it's it's really good to live long

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,009
enough to get old enough that something

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,450
in your life can be described as your

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:12,210
historically known for doing something

00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,849
thank you for putting up with me for a

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,460
few minutes I also want to thank Jim and

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,890
the conference and the organizers for

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,260
inviting me to speak I spoke at one of

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:27,240
their other conferences at in Lake Tahoe

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:30,660
last last winter and it was an amazing

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,380
event my son this is a picture of my son

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,980
who came with me and met leanness and I

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,200
think it's a moment he'll remember for

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,050
all his life we actually hung out with

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,480
Lina's for a little bit and listened to

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,379
his talk and my son is just turned 12 I

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,780
think it was an amazing experience and

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:56,489
and people were so nice to both of us

00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,160
Lina's was so nice Aparna who was just

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,890
talking hung out with us for a bit and

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,969
my son I think was very inspired to meet

00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,320
people who are really doing things like

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,810
that I also really think that that you

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,330
guys the open source community are the

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,189
good guys of the tech industry you know

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:20,130
the ones who build things build most of

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:22,530
what we use today I I want to start with

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,320
sort of an apology or a Maat culpa or

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,060
fall on the sword moment where as some

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,890
people might remember a long time ago I

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,460
was a journalist at force and I covered

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,200
open source and I covered IBM and I was

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,299
famously somewhat skeptical about open

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,380
source and about Linux and here we are

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:44,670
in 2017 so I the skepticism was

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:47,040
misplaced I also on the fake Steve blog

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,649
I used to kind of have fun with the sort

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,970
of more radical elements of the movement

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,770
as picked through Stallman this is one

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,130
where he's killing a shark that violated

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,229
the GPL but I I just thought he was kind

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,000
of too extreme too radical that his

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,100
ideas were maybe even good but they

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,159
would they were impractical the funny

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,250
thing is as I've got older I've kind of

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,450
become radicalized which isn't supposed

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,489
to happen you're supposed to go the

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,400
other way and become I guess more

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:17,659
conservative anyway

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,769
that didn't happen for me so I'll get to

00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,280
what I'm going to talk about and it's a

00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:23,840
very quick story and the full version is

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,480
in this book that I published last year

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,519
and if you're interested in it you can

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,950
get it and read it but I'm just going to

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,170
give you a nutshell of it today which is

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,640
that I went to work in a start-up

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,540
thinking that I knew a lot about the

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,610
tech industry and came away realizing

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,709
that a lot of what I thought I knew was

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,560
wrong and that the industry had changed

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:48,500
in some profound ways and in ways that I

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,290
think have gone off the rail a bit and

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,670
and could end up affecting all of us you

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,640
know becoming a problem for us

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,019
so I got laid off at Newsweek I was the

00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,690
tech editor at Newsweek I got laid off

00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,700
and I went to work at this startup in

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,230
Cambridge I live in Boston and there's a

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,549
place called hub spot but some of you

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,170
might use your company they make

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,780
marketing software for you know

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,489
marketing automation and the weird thing

00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,150
was the average age at the company was

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:16,099
26 and I was 52 I was exactly twice

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,180
double the age of the average employee

00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,959
and most people were right out of

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,730
college and they had every startup

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,940
cliche you can imagine is if there's

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,959
like a catalog for goofy startup stuff

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,040
and they just said it'll take one of

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,690
those two of those one of those so we

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,569
had the dogs in the office we had

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,639
beanbag chair meeting rooms we had all

00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:36,859
the you know the open offices nobody has

00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:39,079
an office you're all these big tables we

00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:42,109
had the big bright basic colors as you

00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,519
can tell on the slide orange was the

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:48,019
corporate colors we had orange

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,120
everything we had these sales bro guys

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,919
these like former lacrosse players who

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,090
did a push-up club in the lobby every

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,239
day like whether they would be like bro

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,840
you know join in you know and do you

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,540
even lift and and then we had beer like

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,069
beer everywhere like frigerators full of

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,780
beer and the bros would like after the

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,280
push-up club go down and their

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,079
flip-flops and the backward baseball

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,000
caps and get some beer go back to the

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,639
desk make their calls for the afternoon

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,799
and then we had a nap room with a big

00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,229
hammock and a nice little Hawaiian theme

00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,000
you could go in there and sleep off you

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:21,919
know the buzz from the beer anyway so

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,240
it's like I had never worked in a place

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,010
like this right now I kind of always

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,380
wanted to but but it was like a frat

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,900
house

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,060
mixed with a Montessori kindergarten and

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,500
a Scientology compound right it was like

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,520
you put those three things in one room

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,230
right and along the lines of the

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,700
Scientology thing that's actually the

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,280
scariest and coolest part of this

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,110
because it was really culty in a way

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,180
that I had never experienced before so

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,350
when you joined the first thing had to

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,090
do is go through two weeks of training

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,060
and ostensibly it was to learn how to

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,740
use the software but really it was a

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,720
kind of brainwashing really it was like

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,750
indoctrination you're really being told

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,150
what it took to be a member of the cult

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,010
right and everyone we were all rock

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,050
stars I don't know why that we're all

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,420
rock stars now and we had superpowers

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,580
and it was like you know you've been

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,930
accepted into the x-men Academy right

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,360
like they would tell us it's harder to

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,980
get a job here than it is to get into

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,510
Harvard right and I've seen it going

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,040
like this is right like I'm but

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm the one old guy in the room right

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,760
and the other kids are the kids are like

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,850
okay harder than Harvard okay you know

00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,500
they're all first job right and we had

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,330
to go around and talk about ourselves

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,530
and you know introduce ourselves and

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,970
tell us what's the one thing that makes

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,670
you a special snowflake what's something

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,160
that nobody here knows about you or

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,390
makes you special like in the end the

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,800
leaders like it I'll tell you my thing

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,180
is I play in a heavy metal band on the

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,400
weekends right I'm like okay great

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,600
I got nothing and I hate this ever

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,490
you know who I hate the one that come

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,870
around talk about yourself and I'm like

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,380
I'm the only one who's had a colonoscopy

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,730
all right you know and they're like

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,670
happy to describe it kids because it's

00:05:50,730 --> 00:06:00,150
coming your way you know hang in there

00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:02,070
there's a hose seriously yeah for those

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,490
of you who haven't turned 50 yet God you

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:08,760
haven't used something to live for now

00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,840
so we had a culture code the father of

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,790
the company one of the founders had

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,250
created this long thing the culture code

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,930
in this subtitle was creating a company

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,400
we loved right and we're supposed to

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,620
love the company and as far as I could

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,390
tell for a long time I didn't even know

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,060
what my job was but I did know the way

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,740
to succeed was just to love the company

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,210
just be super enthusiastic like these

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,980
guys wear orange to work

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,010
jump up if you if the picture being

00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,900
taken jump for the picture right be

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,610
super positive there was a woman who

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,410
would end her emails and sign off like

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,670
go HubSpot go with a bunch of

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,560
exclamation points cuz I

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,200
exclamation points right there marketing

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,000
people right if any of you work in

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,620
marketing you know what I mean

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,860
and they had this thing that I came to

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,180
call a praise gasm where they found out

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,780
you could figure out pretty quickly that

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,240
the way you got rewarded was also by how

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:00,060
much you praised other people right

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,770
which is a kind of a cool idea right so

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,690
because you get people sending praise to

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,740
everybody right so the really people

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,060
really want to get attention for

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,740
themselves it wasn't about bragging

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,780
about yourself what you did was just

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:14,190
find anything to praise and anyone else

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:17,370
and so Julie would decide that Ashley

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:20,130
was did a great job last week and she

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,740
wanted to say Ashley rocks but the way

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,880
you do that is you don't innately start

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,230
work what you do is you send a CEO

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,000
saying hey by the way last week that

00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,470
thing you did that was awesome right and

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,210
if you really wanted to you know help

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:33,240
her out you'd CC her boss and just say

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,980
this one great right but it HubSpot what

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,350
you did is you see see you're the whole

00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,280
department so you'd come in in the

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,630
morning on the beat of this thing where

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,100
somebody had written a love note to

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,050
someone else right okay great

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,070
cool I don't care I don't know either of

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:51,210
you fine off right so but then the

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:55,470
protocol was everyone on the email would

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:58,020
reply to all to say you know yeah I

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,680

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,370
sitting there like I'm old and I'm a

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,910
prick anyway and I'm just like I could

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:10,230
delete delete delete delete right so and

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,270
then I decided no that I look like a

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,500
contrite now I gotta make this work so I

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,810
started joining in but on things like

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,790
yeah woohoo Ashley and then I put like a

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,140
thousand exclamation bites like whoo and

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,110
then they figured out you know you're

00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,660
being a dick stop that right so oh it

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,920
really very quickly went off the rails

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,350
this job

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,480
they were so super positive that when

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,479
they fired you they called it graduation

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,180
right seriously and they would send

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,640
around this really cheery email saying

00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,229

girl ridden the desk is empty he's

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,240
already gone

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,830
like there's no warning to book he's

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,480
gone like it was like living in

00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,740
Argentina in the 1970s there's people

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,660
disappear whoa I don't even know why

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,700
right and they're never spoken up again

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,780
nobody would ever gossip about it ever

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,070
right

00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,990
you know like spinal tap drummer it's

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,020
just a look like a little pile of dust

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,850
left on the chair and I never saw

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,500
anything like this and and you know

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,740
people would be out in their cars crying

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,660
because they graduated a lot of people

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,930
even though we were growing graduation

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,640
happened all the time right and nobody

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,340
there thought it was a problem this is

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,500
what the twist for me nobody thought oh

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,910
this huge turnover is a problem like

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,340
maybe it means we're not hiring well

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,230
they were actually proud of this they

00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,910
didn't feel bad about it and they had

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,230
this thing we're a team not a family you

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,790
know it's like being on the Yankees and

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,710
hey maybe you're not cut you know you're

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,120
not able to play in the big leagues so

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,710
you know just be ready for this this was

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,970
in the culture code but buried way and

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,560
like by the way we can fire you we

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,450
probably will right but we'll call it

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,640
graduation so don't feel too bad right

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,260
the only request I had when they finally

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,320
terminated me he was like don't call a

00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,940
graduation please you know I'm 52 but

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,980
there was also something really callous

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,310
about this something really uncaring and

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,140
it it didn't jibe with the the rhetoric

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,970
on the top of creating a company we love

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,710
and this is such a fun place and we have

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,840
beer and dogs and beanbag chairs it's

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,180
nerve gun wars you know it's so much fun

00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,890
but like when it came down to it it was

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,100
way more callous than any of the old

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:21,510
media places that I had ever worked out

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:23,400
and it turns out this wasn't unique to

00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,810
them they got this idea from Netflix

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,070
which came out with this their own

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,480
culture Dec in 2009 right and I am old

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,950
enough to remember when I first started

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
covering tech one of the things I was

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,280
impressed about going to tech companies

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,960
was even if they didn't mean it they

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,460
would say you know our best assets walk

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,620
out the door at night the people is

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,760
really what we're about we really need

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,020
to take care of our employees because

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,090
we're in at the intellectual property

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,720
business right it's your brains that's

00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:51,990
what we are right and this had changed

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,060
and not just at HubSpot and Netflix but

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,490
kind of across the industry Reed Hoffman

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,200
at LinkedIn has this idea that a job

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,530
isn't a job anymore it's a tour of duty

00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,180
right it's a it's a transaction you're

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,640
going to be here for 18 months two years

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,010
you have companies that will

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,690
brag about how well they fire I've seen

00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,280
people on Twitter talking about how good

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,840
we are at firing people and it's like to

00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,730
me it's like it's like you know

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,040
proposing marriage to a woman and saying

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,720
and by the way when we get divorced I

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,030
just want you to know I'm really good at

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,880
it like I'm really good at divorce it's

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:26,460
gonna be a great divorce right so but

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,590
this is this new compact that had been

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,000
formed and and honestly I wasn't aware

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,860
of it even though I was covering tech I

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,440
wasn't aware of what life was like on

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:39,260
the ground for people inside some of

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,970
these companies so my book came out and

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,800
this guy from Stanford Jeffrey Pfeffer

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,470
who's a big business professor wrote

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,480
this essay called why modern work

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,650
culture makes people so miserable and

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,910
it's not to realize like there's

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,810
something in the Arabic there's

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,790
something weird happening in work like

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,980
what work is and how we work and how we

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:03,090
think of work and why we work and

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,280
Pfeffer saying you know it's it's bad

00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,960
enough being an employee at where I was

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,570
where with no job security and you can

00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,980
get graduated whenever it's worse if

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,930
you're in the gig economy you never even

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,700
get that you never even get to be an

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,740
employee with no job security and lousy

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,930
benefits you get none of that right and

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,300
the weirder thing is as I've started

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,310
reading more about it the gig economy is

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,620
coming for all of us right the notion of

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,540
an employee is gonna be an antiquated

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,630
notion in 10 20 30 they're my kids

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,100
lifetime white-collar workers are all

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,110
being forced out into this situation

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,910
where we're free agents which is okay

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,290
that's old is like hey free agent nation

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,170
you're the brand of you isn't that cool

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,480
well no because now the brand of you has

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,890
to go compete for peace work in an open

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,330
marketplace where you're forced to

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,860
compete against everybody else who's

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,630
looking for work and it's gonna grind

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,370
wages down right that's the inevitable

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,900
outcome now depending on which side of

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,460
that transaction you're on it's a great

00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,780
thing or a bad thing for companies its

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,820
pitches like we're ringing all the

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,200
inefficiency out of the system for us it

00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,160
means like we're gonna you know you're

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,450
gonna Kate even less right beffort says

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,670
basically what we're doing is this isn't

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,650
an internet-enabled innovation which is

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,060
how it's sold right it's sold as like

00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,920
hey this is great we can ring all it

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,510
inefficiency out and everybody can find

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,610
fulfillment know what we're doing is

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,610
returning to what we had 140 years ago a

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,709
centuries worth of progress in worker

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,379
rights

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:23,059
have have been rolled back I did a piece

00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:25,670
in The Times a couple weekends ago about

00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,980
how a century ago workers were going on

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,660
strike for better working conditions you

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,819
know they were forming unions and going

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,119
on strike in textile mills to get better

00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:37,339
hours better protections now we've

00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:38,569
flipped it up to it so inside out then

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:40,249
in Silicon Valley of people wearing

00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,540
pieces to say 9:00 to 5:00 is for the

00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:43,040
week you know celebrating their

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,999
workaholism celebrating their own

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,279
exploitation right it's so pervasive

00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:51,139
that economists have created a name for

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,149
a new class of people that precariat

00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,610
basically people who have precarious

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:56,990
employment who have no benefits who

00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,149
don't know where how they're going to

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,839
pay the bills next month next year right

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:04,730
and this is happening at a time when

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,139
more wealth is being created than ever

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,550
before and it's happening in the

00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,499
industry where most of that wealth is

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,959
being created I'll give you three

00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:14,809
examples of the precariat last year in

00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,089
Scotland a reporter found that workers

00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:18,949
at an Amazon warehouse factory in

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,019
Scotland were living in a tent city

00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:22,970
outside the factory because Amazon

00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,649
provided a bus but charged ten pounds a

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,749
day to ride the bus and they only paid

00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,249
seven pounds an hour so for some people

00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:31,069
it was just worth it to live in a tent

00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:33,860
right now Jeff Bezos is worth eighty two

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,809
billion dollars right six months ago

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,819
when I gave this talk he was worth 70

00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:39,769
billion he's made 12 billion dollars in

00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:44,600
six months and his workers are living in

00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:46,459
tents this is Victor and Nicole they

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,319
both work in a cafeteria at Facebook

00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:53,019
right they live with their three

00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:55,040
children in a garage in Menlo Park right

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,360
because they can they can't afford the

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,040
health insurance that they could buy

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,529
through their employer if they wanted it

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,420
they don't make enough right Facebook

00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:04,429
made 10 billion dollars in profit last

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,910
year they have 30 billion dollars in

00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:09,740
cash Mark Zuckerberg is worth fifty six

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,819
billion dollars he's the fifth richest

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:17,139
person on the planet people working in

00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:19,490
the cafeteria at Facebook should be

00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,740
happy right I mean it should be a great

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,449
job she'd be like I died what the heaven

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,160
I got a job in the cafeteria at Facebook

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm set for life I'm not gonna be a

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,759
bazillionaire but I should be able to

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,350
buy a house put my kids through college

00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,690
right there's no reason for this

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,370
this is rank stork Park in Mountain View

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,830
I went there in June there's 40 or 50

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,260
campers permanently set along the side

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,150
of this road right these are working

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,950
people who basically got priced out of

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,820
their apartments they took the last bit

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,290
of money they had and they bought a

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,640
camper and they parked it on the street

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,560
and they put a generator out there and

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,290
they lived there these are working

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,060
people right the town wants them to be

00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,440
swept out but they can't get rid of them

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,650
right this is two miles from the

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,740
Googleplex eight miles from Facebook so

00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,650
this is a weird thing the rising tide is

00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:10,650
rising but it's not lifting all boats

00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:13,760
something weird is happening you know

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:16,140
we're at work playing beer pong right

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,780
but we're not noticing what's being

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,100
taken away these things that we took for

00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,900
granted about our jobs at least people

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,570
my age sorry who entered the workforce

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,720
you know in the 20th century security

00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,920
stability dignity benefits those things

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,310
are being taken away and I almost

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,140
suspect that the fun and games and the

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,270
dogs and the beer pong is a magician's

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,730
trick that it's a form of misdirection

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,020
it's like we're I having fun work is fun

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,130
and like just don't look at what's

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,790
coming out of your pocket on the other

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:47,310
side right so then the question is why

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:49,980
and I apologize I think this slide is

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,600
hard to read but if you look at venture

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,960
capital and you look at where was in

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,180
1995 and where it was in 2015 so 95 the

00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,690
beginning of the boom - a couple years

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,730
ago right it's four times as many or

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,790
twice as many firms and funds four times

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,970
as many active investors seven times as

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,440
much money invested right ninety five is

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,960
when this all began or I think in

00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,020
Netscape went public and was at 90 in

00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,090
around there and what these guys have

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,640
created is a new business model right

00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:23,940
which is grow fast lose money go public

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,650
cash out right that's the model it

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,060
started with Netscape Netscape was the

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,040
first company that could go public while

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,260
losing money until this till then the

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,120
public markets wouldn't pay for a

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,010
company that wasn't both growing really

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,310
quickly and posting a profit but

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,680
Netscape pulled it off you wonder how

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,670
widespread is this I'll show you in a

00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,650
second but the other thing to remember

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,500
is every bad thing

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:50,750
Springs from this this business model

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:54,630
grow fast lose money go public cash out

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,910
every bad thing comes from this I did a

00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,970
roll up a few months ago of all the tech

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,770
IPO since 2011 then I subtracted

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,940
anything that had been acquired so just

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,430
the ones that are left independent I got

00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,880
sixty companies only ten had ever made a

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,440
profit right so you wonder it suddenly

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,100
it hit me if you want to know why is the

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,660
workplace changing this is in right if

00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,190
you don't make a profit if you don't

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,190
make any money you can't take care of

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,530
your employees more to the point if you

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,030
don't ever intend to make a profit if

00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,150
you know from the beginning that this

00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:29,070
company will never make a profit you

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,480
even have even less concern for

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,340
employees so consider companies like

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,200
Zynga and Groupon though in public in

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,350
2011 at the beginning of this latest

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,970
rush as soon as that everybody made

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,860
their money and the VCS cashed out and

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,870
the founders cashed out those companies

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,030
collapsed they never made money these

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:47,310
aren't really companies these are

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,230
vehicles these are financial instruments

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,030
these are little wagons that these guys

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,590
build they roll them into the public

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,850
markets fill them up with money roll

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,100
them back put them in their pocket and

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:59,040
get the hell out before the whole thing

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:05,250
falls apart not in every case not in

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:07,170
every case but a lot the other ill

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,480
effects that come from this quickly I

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,670
want to go through bro culture income

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,340
inequality and what I call even worse

00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:18,210
stuff I couldn't come up with a better

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,380
name bro culture has become a rampant

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,460
and we're all aware of it it's another

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,430
thing I've written about in The Times

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,560
recently right VCS are bros they invest

00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,750
in bros the bros hire bros so they build

00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,700
a frat house because somewhere along the

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,930
line John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins or

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,000
some other venture capitalist I guess

00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,950
was walking around Stanford on a Friday

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,200
and I looking at some drunk dorm and go

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,250
this is a great model for how to build a

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,870
company why don't we just give these

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,390
guys millions of dollars like that makes

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:45,720
sense right a frat house of course right

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,240
you know yeah and you have this idea of

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,790
culture fit right they hire for culture

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,590
fit what's basically is a euphemism for

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,810
we hire other white guys like us right

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,420
and the best example of this to me is

00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,280
uber and the problem with it isn't job

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,420
that it excludes people is it that these

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,220
guys don't really know how to run

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,600
companies frat boys are not the best

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,220
business people in the world believe it

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,170
or not right I love the picture of

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,760
Travis on the cover of fortune

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,020
I think this by the way came out the

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,760
same week he was fired but anyway I

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,440
don't think I'm an it's like the

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,350
rest of us would like to respectfully

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,760
disagree trav you know I think maybe

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:22,260
just think about that for a little

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,210
second more you know bro culture brings

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,700
with it bias on every vector right on

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,430
age it turned 40 and you're out where

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,050
you don't even get in right race no

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,670
forget it when I was at HubSpot the

00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,950
first time we had an all-hands meeting

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,960
and I saw all 500 people in one big room

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,790
I realized there's no black people and

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,230
not only that there was only one kind of

00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,670
white people they all legally look like

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,200
they all came from Cape Cod right it

00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,350
looks like they made them in a lab right

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,750
if you ever want to get really amused or

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,210
incredibly sad do a thing where you roll

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,070
up the management pages of all the

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,420
unicorns all the American unicorns and

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,550
roll up their boards of directors like

00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,430
and do like you know little thumbnail

00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:01,110
sketches and it's just like white guys

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,340
made in some lab at Stanford I don't

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,830
know where they come from right they all

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,560
look the same right and gender I mean

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,180
genders it's God that's the you know the

00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,500
biggest victim of the bro culture thing

00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,880
is women get in but they only go this

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,950
high up in the organization they don't

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,810
become promoted and even here they just

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,430
get harassed to death I mean that's what

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,320
amazing thing to me about uber is the

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,880
uber story unraveled with one woman who

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,250
was brave enough to just stand up and

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,080
say what happened to her right to me

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:28,820
she's an enormous hero because it was

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,820
took a lot of courage to do that Oh

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,380
and her name is Susan Fowler I hope

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,850
someday they have like a statue or an

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,370
award named after her sir she went to

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:42,149
the Supreme Court and and testified

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,380
there I've written to her and

00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:47,169
correspondent a bit with her eye eye eye

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,690
I admire her courage I can't say how

00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:51,519
much so the next one is income

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,950
inequality right now there are eight

00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,110
guys whose combined wealth equals the

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,289
combined wealth of the bottom half of

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,590
the world a few years ago this was a few

00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:04,809
hundred people then it came to thirty

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,940
now it's eight four of them are techies

00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,679
five if you count Bloomberg right

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,139
although I think Bloomberg fell off more

00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,080
recently but anyway you get the idea the

00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:15,190
industry is creating this radical

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:19,240
concentration of wealth into fewer and

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,889
fewer hands right and this started a

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,899
while ago but it spiked in the Internet

00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:24,820
era this is the the ratio of what

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:27,159
average CEO makes to the average worker

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,049
for a long time it was in the 20s then

00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,090
look at spike in 2000 at the height of

00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:32,019
the dot-com bubble kind of falls back

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,690
and you think well maybe we're going

00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,980
back to 20s like no no we're back at 300

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,139
we're gonna like it here we're just

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,799
gonna stay we'll stay with the 300 ratio

00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,799
thank you right

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:51,549
40 years ago wages represented 52% of

00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:54,250
the u.s. GDP today they represent 46% so

00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:58,690
where did that 6% go corporate profits

00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:01,120
went from 6% to 12% 6% of GDP shifted

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,740
from our pockets into corporate profits

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,360
which they're not reinvesting they're

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,399
keeping us profits in order to line

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,039
their own pockets by making the stock go

00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:11,320
up and then getting bigger bonuses right

00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:14,289
that six percent is worth one trillion

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:17,679
dollars a trillion dollars has been

00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:19,090
stolen from us right so I talked about

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,490
even worse stuff and this is the first

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,610
example right the precariat kind of

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,049
realizes something bad has happened I I

00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,830
think I used to have a trillion dollars

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,630
in I don't know what happened to our

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,149
ears all right but they don't really

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,940
know what or how and they lash out with

00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:35,350
brexit with trumpism you know they know

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,899
they're being screwed but they feel

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,760
powerless and they say you know I still

00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:42,070
have one thing that Larry Ellison has

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,570
the same that's the same as Larry I have

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,960
a vote and I'm gonna use it I'm going to

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,320
punish

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,230
right now that's just the first step it

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,659
gets worse right if we keep going this

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,909
way there are people like this guy Nick

00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,590
Hanauer who's fortunate enough to be one

00:23:54,909 --> 00:24:00,070
of the early maybe the first investor in

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:01,389
Amazon he's amazingly rich he's the guy

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,799
who'd ended up that trillion-dollar

00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:05,379
number I mean he didn't chin it up it's

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,480
a real number but who pointed it out he

00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:10,929
thinks we're facing a revolution right

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,009
that this is just the the first Inklings

00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:13,690
of what's going to become you know the

00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:15,639
pitchforks are coming for us and his

00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,740
solution is very simple that trillion

00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:19,840
dollars that got stolen just let's give

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,350
it back looks like we can take the money

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,669
we just fix the problem we created the

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,710
response from Silicon Valley has been

00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:29,980
quite different right it's just run away

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:31,990
right so it's like they're willfully

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,779
blind to the problem they have caused

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,639
right and if oddly enough look at all of

00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,960
the interesting highfalutin rhetoric

00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,549
that comes out of Silicon Valley the

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,639
most interesting stuff that they all sit

00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:46,869
around navel-gazing about it's all about

00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:48,159
escape right Silicon Valley is all about

00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:50,110
escape right now so they're gonna do

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,309
seasteading well you know we won't fix

00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:53,529
this world it's all up anyway

00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:55,899
we'll just build an island where we are

00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:58,210
in charge and we'll live there right or

00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:59,830
we'll carve California up into six

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,029
states and one will be Silicon Valley so

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,289
we won't have to support all those

00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:04,779
 in the other parts of

00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:06,759
California right or we'll have some sort

00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:08,289
of tech utopia even part of a city or

00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:10,119
we'll create these worlds that are

00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,159
outside government control and we'll

00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,869
just let like Google control it sorry

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,639
Aparna but you know well that big tech

00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:17,590
companies will that that or or let Peter

00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,929
Thiel run it that'll be good right or

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,639
you have Ray Kurzweil talking about the

00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:24,759
singularity which is a basically let's

00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:26,679
escape biology right well let's escape

00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,230
death itself we don't even have to die

00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,970
we can just we can become immortal right

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,009
Elon Musk is no that let's go to

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,799
Mars right let's just live on Mars right

00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:36,970
that's what we'll do right and then then

00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,139
they have a big debate can we get to

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,399
Mars I don't know can we do it in our

00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,419
lifetime will that singularity happen

00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:42,279
it's like meanwhile they're stepping

00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:44,169
over homeless people on the way to work

00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:46,509
they have to drive past rank Store Park

00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:49,749
and the campers to go have this stupid

00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:51,970
conversation right that only really

00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:53,019
stupid rich people could even have they

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,820
have the luxury of having these

00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:58,400
conversations right

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,260
the best version of escapism and it's a

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,970
near-term one this is story from The New

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,430
Yorker a few months ago which definitely

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,880
should read doomsday prep for the super

00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:10,370
rich oligarchs are buying land right

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,470
stocking up on guns and food and

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,360
ammunition right to prepare for the

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:19,100
apocalypse that they think is coming

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,810
right that they caused Peter teal has

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,410
bought have built a big compound in New

00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,810
Zealand

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,540
with a landing strip you know and an

00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:29,510
armored bunker so that if the

00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:32,150
really hits the fan right he can fly to

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,580
New Zealand and just hide in a hole with

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,290
his billions of dollars right instead of

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,700
fixing the problem like Nick Hanna it

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,980
says just take the money give it back

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,950
fix the problem right they're just gonna

00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,050
go hide out with their money he'll who

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,610
by the way campaigned for Trump and then

00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,610
suddenly you don't hear about him you

00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,900
just vanished when Trump won so they

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,970
don't want to take responsibility for

00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,800
the problem they created which is a long

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,360
way of getting to the point that I think

00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,670
in Stallman was right the whole time

00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,770
right like this is what I finally

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:05,030
realized twenty years later I was like I

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:13,370
thought he was crazy because he's living

00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:16,130
on a cot in MIT right but he wasn't what

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,750
you know we on the HBO show Silicon

00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,510
Valley we had a big running joke about

00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,130
how these smarmy marketing tech people

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,270
come out and talk about changing the

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,850
world and making the world a better

00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:29,990
place you know Gavin Belson who's just a

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:31,550
complete villain right but the thing I

00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,170
want to leave you with is I still

00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,360
believe that we can make the world a

00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:37,850
better place right I think it's first by

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,980
abandoning that model of grow fast lose

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:45,950
money cash out and run away right we can

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,600
easily easily create companies where

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,970
Amazon workers don't have to live in

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,950
tents and we're goober drivers can be

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,380
real employees with real benefits and

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:57,080
some dignity and a decent life right and

00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,490
we're cafeteria workers at Facebook can

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,800
actually have a good life they shouldn't

00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:04,400
have to live in a garage right we can do

00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,930
that right the reason I first fell in

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,510
love with covering technology a long

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,620
time ago historically speaking was that

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,990
it was an industry

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,000
lifted up thousands of people had

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:17,150
created prosperity for entire

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,890
communities right that industry has been

00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,450
hijacked by people who just want to get

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:23,660
rich quick and to hell with everybody

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:26,030
else but you guys the people who build

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:29,780
things who build companies you're the

00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:36,660
ones who can fix it thank you very much

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:36,660
