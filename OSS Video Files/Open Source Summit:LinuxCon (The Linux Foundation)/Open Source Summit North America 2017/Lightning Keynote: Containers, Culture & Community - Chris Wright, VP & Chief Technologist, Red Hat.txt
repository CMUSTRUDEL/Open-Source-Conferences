Wow I am hooked so actually it's

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,010
interesting I was thinking about this

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,340
leading up to this this keynote here and

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,400
thinking what got me into open-source

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,970
and what got me into open-source I've

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,920
been involved for maybe 20 years and I

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,439
think I just started to understand I'm

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:30,230
not sure if I was manipulated into it or

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,399
or what but there's something about

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,640
collaboration there's something about

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,219
working together that creates that

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,870
incentive and reward and there was also

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,750
something about investment and

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,700
continuing and perfecting and getting

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:51,360
more and more a part of that tribal

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:53,879
culture so to me I think we talk I live

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,969
breathe and eat technology we talk a lot

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,800
about technology you just heard that the

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,449
best technology doesn't always win when

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,239
we've heard that for quite some time use

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,750
the you know the classic VHS Betamax

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,760
kind of discussion what makes an

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,320
open-source project successful

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,510
absolutely there's a technology

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,430
component you're trying to build

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,590
important technology and build something

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,990
that's useful for users you're trying to

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,140
solve a hard problem but there's a

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,790
culture there's a there's a group of

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,860
people that are collaborating together a

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,380
community that are building something

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,290
that I think creates a third important

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,079
dimension which is sometimes I like to

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:39,110
call the magic pixie dust of open-source

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:43,200
software the ability to get involved

00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,270
easily the ability to make a difference

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,399
independent of your of your skills or

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,590
where you fit into the mix I think are

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,040
really important critical pieces of of

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,329
creating a community and one of the

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,700
things that I think we can always work

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,619
on improving is onboarding new community

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,210
members so this week has been really

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,509
interesting I love seeing amazing

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,710
eloquent teenagers on stage it's not not

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,099
something I experience every day and

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,270
then and then movie stars doing you know

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,239
really impressive things through

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,720
collaboration and finding a path for

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,030
anybody to get involved

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,300
so the ability that we to the degree

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,220
that we can be open and embrace

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,820
diversity I think will improve the

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,420
community and improve the ultimate

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:32,500
technology that we're building together

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:34,510
I believe that open source is the modern

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,740
innovation engine and you hear that a

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,090
lot I don't think I'm the only person

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,910
that would that would fall into that

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,010
category of believing this is a core way

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:48,610
that we actually develop next-generation

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:51,250
technology the so so thank you for being

00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,709
involved in this in this innovation

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,830
engine it's something that's really

00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,000
important to Red Hat we help work in

00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,650
these upstream communities and we

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,150
deliver this innovation to our customers

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,700
it's a big part of what we do so we

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,630
wouldn't be here without you I and I had

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:10,540
a curious question who's independent of

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:13,120
the name change OSS summit you know

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,209
Linux con cloud open container con who's

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,280
here for the first time is up first Wow

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,590
okay that's awesome I did not expect

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,300
that it's a large number of people who's

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:29,040
been involved in open-source development

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:32,560
for like two years five years ten years

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,709
twenty years okay so we have a good mix

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,200
so the veterans your job is to find the

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,239
new people and bring them into the fold

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,940
and really help them be welcome so that

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,070
we can continue to build this amazing

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,130
technology where we're changing the

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:51,549
world together Linux for me is where I

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,950
got started and Linux is a platform

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,940
ubiquitous platform the purpose of the

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,980
platform is to run applications and

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,090
traditionally as an operating system you

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,140
know part of your job is lighting up

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,150
Hardware and part of your job of

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,100
supporting applications so you have an

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,709
application running on on a piece of

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,959
hardware I want the great values that

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,060
Linux brought was independence between

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,549
the underlying hardware and the

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,880
application layer so you kind of got

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:21,459
disaggregated stacks today those

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,240
applications are not running on a single

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,760
piece of hardware

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,740
they're running across a data center

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,680
infrastructure a cloud

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,100
often containerized containerization

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,320
just helps separation of concerns for

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:39,070
your application and your operations

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,720
teams and this platform that we're

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,760
building together for us who are really

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,919
invested in kubernetes this platform

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,419
that we're building together is what I

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,100
see as a next-generation application

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,690
platform building that same level of

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,400
Independence between the application and

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,410
the underlying infrastructure where the

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,560
infrastructure now maybe a cloud public

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:59,320
cloud or internal data center and I

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,900
think what's interesting in this picture

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,050
is the applications you know there some

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,330
are new some are old what they have in

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:12,940
common with the traditional side of the

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:16,300
equation is their Linux applications so

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:19,540
containers are Linux your applications

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,240
are running containerized on Linux and

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:25,320
this is really exciting for me having

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,990
spent a long time in the linux world

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,850
linux continues to be highly relevant

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,640
even as we you know talk about higher

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,430
level services it's all grounded in what

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,039
we've built in linux and it's actually I

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,039
don't know the exact story but my

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,570
recollection is roughly one day leanness

00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,539
woke up grumpy because somebody had

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,550
broken his laptop and issued a decree

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,860
thou shalt not break user space and

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,930
without that mentality of maintaining

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,700
stability between the kernel and the

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,110
application layer containers really

00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,760
wouldn't have the power that they have

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:02,560
today continuing on with the operating

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,300
system I think something that's really

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,760
exciting again in the Linux space making

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:14,770
more applications capable of running on

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:17,050
a platform like kubernetes initially you

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,850
start with that 80% general-purpose

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:23,289
you know the lamp stack of Linux in the

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:25,840
early days to get to ubiquity you have

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:28,210
to take on more and more niche workloads

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,520
and one of the things that's really

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,660
exciting today to me is the cloud kind

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,550
of obscured the underlying

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,400
infrastructure just made a homogenous

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,500
and that works well for a certain

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,069
general class of problems as we take on

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,839
more and more problems

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:46,460
trying to solve more challenging

00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,800
scenarios we have to look at what

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,319
hardware is doing to support that and so

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,389
things like IOT where you have edge

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:56,270
devices that may have small form factors

00:06:53,389 --> 00:07:00,259
or machine learning where you need GPUs

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,509
to accelerate your machine learning

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,240
frameworks these are really starting to

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,289
expose hardware again in ways that I

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,659
think are really interesting and

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,580
exciting so that workload specific

00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:12,979
optimization is a critical part of of

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,169
where we're going together and so I

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:18,860
really just wanted to say thank you very

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,830
much for your focus and passion on open

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,439
source we're making a huge difference we

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:28,069
saw earlier in the week or last week

00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:30,139
some major security concerns so we also

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:33,379
have to continue to up our game and help

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,659
the industry build wonderful and safe

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,610
technology so thank you pursue your

00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:43,559
passion have a great week here

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,559
