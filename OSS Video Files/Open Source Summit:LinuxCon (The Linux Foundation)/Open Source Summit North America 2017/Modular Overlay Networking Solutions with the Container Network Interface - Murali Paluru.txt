Description: 
	Modular Overlay Networking Solutions with the Container Network Interface - Murali Paluru, Rancher Labs, Inc.

The Container Network Interface (CNI) is becoming the de facto standard for implementing plugins for container runtimes, and is used by Mesos, Kubernetes, and Cloud Foundry. The same CNI standard makes it possible to implement networking as a modular component of your environment, enabling teams to swap in the best networking solution based on the infrastructure used. This talk will walk through the process of building and implementing modular networking solutions, designed to swapped out based on use case. Weâ€™ll conclude with a demo of the solutions built, and include important takeaways for determining which overlay networking solutions are best suited for certain use cases.
