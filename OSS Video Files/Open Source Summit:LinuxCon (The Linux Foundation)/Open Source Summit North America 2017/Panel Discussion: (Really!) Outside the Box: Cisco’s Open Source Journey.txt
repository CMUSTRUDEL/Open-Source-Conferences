Publication date: 2017-09-14
Playlist: Open Source Summit North America 2017
Description: 
	Panel Discussion: (Really!) Outside the Box: Cisco’s Open Source Journey - Moderated by Ed Warnicke, Cisco

Not used to hearing Cisco and “open” used in the same sentence? Wondering why Cisco is investing as heavily as it is in open source technologies? If you answered yes to either of those questions, this panel is for you. Join moderator and Linux luminary Ed Warnicke along with panelists Serpil Bayraktar, Anne McCormick, and Charles Eckel as they discuss the various areas of Cisco’s involvement in the open source ecosystem. They’ll be covering Cisco’s involvement in and contributions to FD.io/VPP, SNAS.io, OpenStack, Kubernetes/Cloud Native, and much more. The panel will also discuss how Cisco’s contributions and involvement in open source technologies are key components in its future strategy. You’ll also have the opportunity to learn about Cisco DevNet (developer.cisco.com), Cisco’s developer resource hub that offers learning labs, forums, sandboxes, API and code libraries, hackathons, and much, much more. The future is open and Cisco is moving forward to embrace it with (you knew it was coming) open arms.

About Ed Warnicke
Ed has been working for over a decade in many areas of networking and Open Source. He has been a member of the OpenDaylight TSC since its inception, is a prolific contributor of code to multiple ODL projects and is the TSC Chair at fd.io. Ed Warnicke is a Principal Engineer in the CTAO group at Cisco Systems. He has a masters in Physics (String Theory) from Rutgers University.

About Serpil Bayraktar
Serpil Bayraktar started her career, quite by accident, as a Network Operator for the NSFNET project in the early 1990s. She worked as an operator, on-call engineer, network engineer and architect during this historical transition from a publicly funded research network to today’s commercial Internet. Her area of expertise is in IP routing protocols, but she enjoys every aspect of running and designing networks.

She spent the second half of her career helping vendors innovate high-quality networking software. In this role, she was responsible for delivering some of today’s most popular technologies, such as VPNs, to network providers. Her experience as an operator gave her a unique intuition for detecting flaws in software implementations that would help vendors reduce their release cycles.

In her current role as a Principal Engineer at Cisco’s Chief Technology and Architecture Office, she has been leading projects that enable networks to become more software-defined, more adaptable, and more responsive to the demands of the emerging hybrid cloud ecosystem. Currently she is leading Cisco’s streaming network analytics initiative: an open and collaborative network data analytics framework that aims to revolutionize the network applications landscape.

Serpil is also the founder of Cisco’s Women in Technology Program, an advisor to the Women in Science and Engineering group at Cisco and an active participant to panel discussions and conferences concerning gender equality at work.

She has a BS in Electrical Engineering from Istanbul Technical University, and an MBA from Eastern Michigan University.

About Charles Eckel
Charles started with open source 1999 as a founding member of Vovida Networks, developing some of the industry’s first open source VoIP protocol stacks and applications. Now at Cisco, he is a recognized champion of open standards, open source, and interoperability. He runs DevNet’s Open Source Dev Center and successfully introduced open source hackathons into IETF and MEF, uniting open source software with open standards to maximize the pace and relevance of both.

About David Lapsley
David Lapsley leads the Metacloud Engineering team within Cisco Advanced Services. David’s background is in networking, cloud computing, data visualization, software as a service, and user experience. David has been using Python for over 10 years and Django for 5 years. His first commercial Python project was writing a Spread Spectrum Software Defined Radio application for NASA. His first commercial Django project was the front end for a CyberSecurity product developed for Carrier-grade VoIP networks.
David's career has taken him from graduate school in Melbourne Australia, where he studied advanced congestion control algorithms in packet switched networks, via the networking and telecommunications industry, advanced network research for NASA, DHS, DARPA and other government agencies, and finally on to OpenStack. David's work on OpenStack has been primarily on Horizon and Neutron, but he enjoys working on all aspects of OpenStack.

About Anne McCormick
Anne is a Software Engineer who joined the Cisco OpenStack team in 2014, and has attended the past five OpenStack summits. She is an active member of Women of Openstack, is a new OpenStack mentor, and has a background in networking, video, high-availability and virtualization.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
the experience of Cisco which is a very

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,410
large company participating in

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,019
open-source and had a lot of different

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,730
kinds of conversations here this time

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,559
other times about sort of that

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,350
experience so I'm not waiting to get so

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,900
much other than nitty-gritty of the

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,550
these sort of blocking and tackling

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,230
learning to engage with the community

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,150
stuff because we have a number of

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,699
panelists who have actually participated

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,220
widely in communities in moving forward

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:35,190
the world in open-source what I'd really

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:38,899
love to do is to get some you guys it's

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,489
like this the kinds of questions you

00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,610
doing in the community rather than the

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,559
what does it like to be in a big company

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,910
so to begin what I'd like to do is offer

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,559
our panelists the opportunity to

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,700
introduce themselves a little bit of

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,050
what their experience has been in the

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,489
kinds of communities they've worked in

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,469
and the kinds of things they've worked

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,550
on and you're free to proceed in

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,739
whatever order but I'm going to bet on

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:04,320
moving that way that sounds good thanks

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,680
ed Damian Hanson I'm a software engineer

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,229
with Cisco and I currently work on the

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,549
kubernetes project I've been involved in

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:17,880
containers for about three years I am

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:23,070
leading a team of engineers that is

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,130
adding ipv6 support to kubernetes if you

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,400
were in this room a couple hours ago for

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,540
Thomas graphs presentation on kubernetes

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,530
an ipv6 Thomas and I work very closely

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,570
together in the community so it's been a

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,560
really exciting project in the sense

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,759
that you know it's not a Cisco only

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:51,450
project it's a 600 a Cisco only effort

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,270
it's representation from a lot of

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,219
different affiliates that have been able

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,490
to add this support to kubernetes so

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,490
it's a real open source success story

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,000
hi I'm Charles echo I'm a software

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,300
engineer by I guess education training

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,200
and been doing that for the majority of

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,830
my my career working with open source a

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,350
lot starting in like 1999 when I think

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,480
open source really first at least in my

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,800
mind that's when it kind of first came

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,870
in the masses and done a lot of work

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,300
with standards as well throughout the

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,200
years the area where I've been working

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,520
is mostly around communication software

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,280
initially more like traditional

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,190
telephony systems and voice over IP and

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,130
video conferencing and that's what

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,930
brought me to into Cisco and now I work

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,660
in def net that's our developer Network

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,970
and I have the role of representing to

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,070
the external development community what

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,750
Cisco is doing an open source and in

00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,340
standards helping you understand where

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,680
we're contributing to open source and to

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,040
standards how they manifest themselves

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,930
in our products and solutions and how

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,120
you can work with us how we can help you

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,920
to build on top of the products and

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,800
solutions that we provide using the

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,180
api's that are there when the codes open

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,040
source I think that makes it even easier

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,950
for us to work together hi everyone my

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,980
name is searched by reactor and I'm a

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,890
principal engineer at Cisco in chief

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,720
technology and architecture office I've

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,900
been working in the networking industry

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,410
since early 1990s before the internet

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,230
was commercial my expert mostly as a

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:43,410
network engineer my expertise is in IP

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,260
routing protocols I've been with Cisco

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,019
for six years and in the last three

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,299
years I have been my team and I are

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,940
running an open-source project called

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:59,250
streaming network analytics system or

00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:01,530
snazz Nazario what we do we tackle the

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,739
problem that was not really solved in

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,019
the last 20 years in networking to get a

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,680
very special kind of data from the

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,150
network meaning bgp data which is

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,510
stateful and different than the other

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,310
ones in real-time

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,470
and it's been very interesting and

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,280
rewarding to work with open source

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:25,310
community in May our project moved under

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,350
the Linux Foundation family it's been

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,070
also interesting for me to go through

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,830
that process I'm also the founder of

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,960
woman in technology at Cisco where every

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,120
month the technical woman at Cisco get

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:45,770
together to talk about what's going on

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:48,520
in our industry I don't think this is

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,520
working is it working

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,480
hi there I'm Anne McCormack I'm a tech

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,270
lead at Cisco software engineer I've

00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,610
been working at Cisco for maybe too long

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,230
some might say 11 years I've been

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,080
working with OpenStack for the last

00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:08,450
three years and I attended I think five

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,430
different OpenStack summits what I work

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,580
on particularly is meta cloud which is

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:16,670
an on-prem managed cloud solution that

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,560
Cisco offers so we go to the customer

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,210
site install the hardware get the

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,040
infrastructure working and stahl

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,450
OpenStack on top of it and then continue

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,000
to maintain it as a service going

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:31,850
forward and particularly what I focus on

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:42,200
is networking in OpenStack I think think

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:51,070
times having a buyer I wouldn't open up

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:51,070
with a question me to express it but why

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:59,650
you're up who wants to go first

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:13,550
okay why okay I'm gonna take that as

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,890
well why am i involved in an open source

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,040
and kind of why am i passionate about it

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:21,320
and I think for me things got started I

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,310
mentioned back in 1999

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,740
I want to go work for a startup company

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,930
we were in we called ourselves Boveda

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,560
and Boveda came from the name voice

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:39,380
video and data we were going after

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:44,510
making software for for communication

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,890
voice over IP stacks and Linux was kind

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,200
of the thing at the time so we thought

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,700
we'd build everything on Linux

00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
open-source was Steven really cool so we

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,280
thought we'd open source everything we

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,170
did protocol stacks our soft switch as

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,480
we called it everything was out there in

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,630
the open I didn't have any idea how we

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,380
were gonna make money or be sustainable

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,330
but but it was fun

00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,500
we were we were doing great things and

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,960
people were excited about what we were

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,150
doing and I remember people would heckle

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,880
us about our name like Vevey de and they

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,550
like is that Velveeta and because cause

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,900
the cheese company and we kind of took

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,030
that to heart and we decided well what

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,450
we'll name our releases after cheese's

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,390
so our first release came out it was

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,240
kind of rough it was you know if some

00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,650
would say it stank weak weaker somebody

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,210
called it Stilton we thought that was a

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,730
very felt fitting name for our first

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,830
release fortunately things got better

00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,420
and better and eventually we came out

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,500
with the release that we thought was you

00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,010
know getting to be a little more

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,110
sophisticated we called it Brie and and

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,580
then I remember going home afterwards it

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,650
was having to be my sister's birthday

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,760
and her name was Brianne but we always

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:54,470
called her Brie and to me it this may

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,750
seem stupid but it was kind of special

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,430
that the name of our release it was it

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,070
was in all the files it was in the

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,410
software and then I could go and I could

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,300
show her what I was working on at work

00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,070
I'd never shown my family like the code

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,600
I wrote here I thought it was special

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,040
because I could sure hey here's this

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,900
release that's named after you

00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,340
she's my kid sister so she was really

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,020
young and she was kind of touched I

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,060
could show her this and and then we

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,090
could actually like build it and run it

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,130
and use it to make a call and make our

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,440
home phone ring you know so kind of

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,270
stupid stuff but it to me it was cool

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,669
I'd never shared anything

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,610
like that with my family with my sister

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,649
and it kind of donna me how cool this

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,039
open-source software was the fact that

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,930
it made what i did that tangible and to

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,110
share with my family with my friends

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:46,459
with the rest of the community and loved

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:50,330
it ever since so who's up next i can go

00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:52,490
next so i guess there are different

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,830
reasons why you would go open-source

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,020
when i look at some of the reasons why

00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,270
people did open-source in the past is

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,779
that you're dealing with a very pressing

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,339
issue that involves multiple entities

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:06,500
maybe a whole industry you want to go

00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,810
fast you want to be agile you want to

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,860
apply it to a lot of places and the

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:16,250
problem space that I was dealing with

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:18,980
involved legacy and new networks across

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:22,550
industries and all types and sizes of

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,180
networks and so we really wanted to look

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,130
at the problem holistically without the

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,700
restrictions of any of the vendor

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:34,310
specific targets like one product in

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,339
mind it was too narrow for us so we

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,459
wanted to collaborate and be very

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,930
transparent with the community of the

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:45,740
system that we were building we wanted

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:51,290
to get that feedback fast and honestly

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:54,709
so through the open source you know you

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:57,680
kind of bypass all the regular process

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:59,990
channels and you go directly to the

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,920
members and the users and it's been

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,990
really really rewarding originally we

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,990
were a standalone open source project

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,790
just on the side but in May we did move

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,800
under Linux Foundation and the reason

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,050
for that move is that once you have

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,120
something that solves the original

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,240
problem and you have a framework it

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,930
doesn't end there it actually begins so

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,279
we wanted to be part of the ecosystem of

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,709
projects who could really benefit from

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,839
what we built we wanted to you know

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,640
provide that service to them and we also

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,950
wanted to understand what else was going

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,630
on in the industry you know whether what

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,089
we built is really enough future-looking

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,879
so

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:46,499
it's been a very productive and useful

00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:48,509
approach so monetization I think comes

00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:51,959
after when you're dealing with a really

00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:57,959
big problem and so far it's been a

00:10:51,959 --> 00:11:00,449
really good journey so I'm gonna take

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:04,139
that with my OpenStack glasses on and

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:06,749
say why is cisco doing OpenStack I've

00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,519
been hearing you know the terms waves of

00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,439
the Internet the first wave was when we

00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,689
were building the infrastructure and of

00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:14,730
course Cisco was deeply entrenched in in

00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:16,829
building that and the protocols defining

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,279
that being in the standards bodies IETF

00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:21,420
the second wave is cloud so now we're

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,160
not so concerned about the

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,079
infrastructure it's there it's great

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,240
it's working now we want to build on top

00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:29,430
of it we want to look at things from an

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,139
application point of view so the

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,740
innovations really are happening at that

00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:37,199
level now and why particularly OpenStack

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,480
is because it's a leading open source

00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:41,959
cloud infrastructure so I think it makes

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:48,899
sense for Cisco to participate in that

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:53,939
and that's it for me I'll take the why

00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:57,139
and say why ipv6 for kubernetes I was

00:11:53,939 --> 00:12:01,230
presented a unique opportunity of to

00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:06,089
kind of have an blank canvas about eight

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:08,009
or nine months ago and so we were going

00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:12,629
our group was going through a transition

00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:13,889
and our management team came to me and

00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:16,559
said okay we want to start getting

00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:17,420
involved in open source container

00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,759
projects

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:24,749
can you help lead a team and then figure

00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:27,410
out where and how and and why and so you

00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:30,839
know this why question is I asked myself

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,990
why quite a bit during this process and

00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,589
and so as I looked through the container

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:40,949
landscape again I had a background of a

00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:43,270
couple years in containers before this

00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:46,080
came about and

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:49,000
and and so I honed in on kubernetes and

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,770
for multiple reasons I saw it as kind of

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,810
rising to the top as that you know

00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:57,700
container clustering system right how do

00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,760
I run containers at scale across

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,430
multiple hosts in my data center across

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:08,170
multiple data centers you know it was

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:10,630
going from docker to to kubernetes

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,000
because docker solved that problem of

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,460
how do I take an application and make it

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,370
easier to deploy a managed maintain on a

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,140
single host but as everyone started

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,270
drinking the docker kool-aid that's

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,660
really when the conversation started

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:29,350
turning to - kubernetes and so I honed

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:33,640
in on kubernetes and I you know I asked

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:35,890
myself why across three primary

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,590
spectrums is okay if we're gonna

00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:41,650
contribute to kubernetes you know why do

00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:46,360
we contribute to kubernetes why do we

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:47,950
use ipv6 and I said to myself well ipv6

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,610
was important to the kubernetes

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:54,370
community so I checked that box and I

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,050
said okay well ipv6 is important and

00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:01,150
Cisco we're networking company we have a

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:03,910
rich tradition in ipv6 so to me I was

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,040
able to check that box of why ipv6 for

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,410
Cisco and then I think most importantly

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,060
is customer like if you're not solving a

00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,580
customer problem you're not trying to

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,990
help a customer then why are why are you

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,250
doing this you know it could be great

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,110
for the community could be great for

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,390
Cisco but ultimately if you're not

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,580
helping a customer out then why are you

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,260
doing this and you know we were

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,610
fortunate to actually have multiple

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:30,700
lighthouse customers that wanted this

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,220
functionality they wanted ipv6 their big

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,830
ipv6 shop across our data centers

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,450
they're moving forward with kubernetes

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,860
and they're saying you know they're

00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,100
saying to us they're saying to the

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:45,790
community where is ipv6 and kubernetes

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:49,420
and so that's what essentially brought

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:52,210
us to contributing ipv6 to kubernetes

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,110
and this is an effort that started the

00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:57,880
beginning of this year

00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:00,310
and it's really great to see

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,640
the team and I going from sitting on the

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:06,550
sidelines to actually being highly

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,020
involved in the Signet work community if

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,500
you're familiar with the kubernetes it's

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,840
such a big project so much going on they

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,690
break the project up into SIG's special

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,420
interest groups and again we went from

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:22,690
not being involved at all and the Signet

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:26,170
work group to being highly involved in

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,490
ipv6 being probably the number one

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:32,410
feature that's going to be coming out

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:35,380
and 1.9 release and again it's not a

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:38,710
Cisco only kind of thing which to me is

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,510
is you know one of the big drivers of

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,760
open source right this isn't something

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,070
that Cisco's doing we may be highly

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:51,160
involved in it but again there's

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:54,000
affiliations Google mer antis Andre who

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,470
is up here I mean the list goes on of

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,530
contributors in the community both in

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,990
kubernetes CNI which is another project

00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:08,160
that's very important to Cooper and his

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:11,470
networking sky DNS for Kuby DNS and so

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,960
it's just been really a great ride over

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,080
the last eight or nine months going from

00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:19,300
what do we do here - actually you know

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,920
starting to paint that canvas with the

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,430
picture and now we're just putting kind

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:29,550
of the finishing touches on that picture

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:34,240
thank you all so who see situations you

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:44,890
this is also true you know and so I have

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:46,200
an expansive you don't even thinking

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,239
Mike

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,239
[Music]

00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:06,350
[Music]

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:11,420
awesome great alright so for the

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:13,280
audience at home so I have a very

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,480
expansive view of panels um everyone

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,370
likes to think of panels as a collection

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,630
of people up on stage we have a very

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,550
distinguished collection of people up on

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,290
stage I tend to think of panels is

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,730
including the audience as well and so

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,680
the question I really want to pose pose

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:28,670
to you guys in the audience is why are

00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,840
you here why did you show up here what

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,400
are the things that you're really

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,190
interested in coming to understand from

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:42,700
being here so please speak up raise your

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:42,700
hands let me know yes hello

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:28,510
[Laughter]

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:30,610
money's good that that's a really good

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,020
question um really quickly does anyone

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,090
on the panel want to respond to that and

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,049
sort of describe their experience inside

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:40,179
Cisco cuz we've got many different

00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:42,730
viewpoints there I guess I could just

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:45,730
say sometimes I think of open source

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,710
like tree huggers it's a utopia you know

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,070
everything we all love each other and

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,570
get along and but the reality is we need

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,760
to make money right I mean we all work

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,070
for companies that need to make money so

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,320
I think it's a very big concern how do

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,110
you monetize that how do you how do you

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,809
come to panels and summits like this and

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:07,120
not appear as just a vendor trying to

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:09,549
sell hardware it's it's a very difficult

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:17,320
balance I like to think we're doing it

00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:20,679
well but sure so been involved in open

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,110
source within Cisco for five or six

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:27,370
years and I remember the first year or

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:29,860
so it was very difficult the company at

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,020
that time just didn't get open source

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,820
and so a lot of my time was spent

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,789
actually just internal discussions

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,669
internal meetings of explaining why open

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:46,929
source and that it's not a threat to you

00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:49,149
right so from me speaking personally how

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:52,419
to do open source to me is it's not

00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:54,429
rocket science you know what I like to

00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:56,890
do in life generally is if I go to do

00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:58,450
something and it's new to me I always

00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,850
try to kind of look around and figure

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,500
out have someone done this before you

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,480
know and so when you look at open source

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,399
there may be a lot of different open

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,950
source contributors out there and

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:11,830
companies that contribute but for me

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:15,580
personally I look at the likes of

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:19,180
Red Hat the likes of core OS companies

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:22,360
that have built a successful business

00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:24,940
model around open source software and I

00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,770
think if you if you spend that time to

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,140
look at well how does Red Hat do this

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:31,330
how do they how are they so successful

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,610
in these open source projects but still

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,690
a very profitable company and you spend

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:39,370
that time to to see how they do it you

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,280
can almost use that as kind of your

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:49,450
recipe for Ericsson or whatever company

00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:50,740
that you work for I think when I look at

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,610
open source

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,120
Cisco's been involved with open source

00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:00,970
for a long time but most of the focus on

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,850
internal say policies and and that type

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:07,210
of thing was around compliance really it

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:10,660
was about you know licensing things

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,250
correctly attributing this you're

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,470
supposed to to meet the licenses that

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,480
you're using not using licenses and

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:20,160
software packages that you shouldn't use

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,710
in certain ways to kind of more of a

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,420
protect yourself type of mentality but

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,860
that's what's been pretty strong in

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:32,410
Cisco for a long time it was only kind

00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,330
of more recently that I think you know

00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:36,490
Cisco engineers had been contributing to

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,380
open source but it was on sort of a and

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:41,710
still it is to a large extent it's very

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,330
disaggregated Cisco for those of you who

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,030
are not as familiar with Cisco

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,290
corporated sound community one of things

00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,930
I really like about it is how this

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,730
aggregated the company is it's it's

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,260
actually you'll see people and Cisco

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,090
have no idea what other people are doing

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,850
and sometimes they're doing sort of

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,260
conflicting or duplicate things we'll

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,620
find out about it at conferences like

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,620
this

00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,840
one reason to do open that happen to you

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:10,460
- and it's from an employee point of

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,430
view it's very empowering because you

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,800
can go off and do things and I think so

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,690
far with open-source contribution it's

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,300
worked out quite well at Cisco because

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,330
the employees have had the best interest

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,400
and been educated and more or less

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,420
contribute to open source well however I

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,250
think there's a lot of room for

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,400
improvement we don't have any sort of

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,530
like central open source office

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,420
maybe we should but we love that

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,850
disaggregated nest - so I don't know it

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,620
there's a trade-off there so I think we

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,240
have room for improvement but you know

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,650
as long as people are doing the right

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,560
thing and the open source community it

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:48,980
seems to be working so far that's how I

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:51,350
would describe it so to answer your

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:54,110
question how does open source work at

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:57,550
Cisco I think the answer depends on your

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,550
group first of all

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,649
[Music]

00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:32,440
so it really depends on where you think

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:34,540
the real money monetization come from

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,930
so we're tackling the infrastructure

00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:40,360
problem the collection of stateful data

00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,030
that's in the hundreds of millions of

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,760
objects if you think about routing the

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,500
number of prefixes you collect and if

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,940
you want to do it in real time which

00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:57,490
people do all kinds of workarounds like

00:23:50,940 --> 00:24:00,220
dumps and other ways I you know we so I

00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,480
mean this what I wanted to say about the

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,220
groups is that I'm in the chief

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,510
technology and architecture office which

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:10,060
is not necessarily a product group and

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:13,030
our job is to really see where we should

00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:16,090
invest what the framework should look

00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,800
like and the monetization really is

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,920
going to come from the applications that

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:24,430
are built on top of it cisco just like

00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:26,500
any other company will have to write the

00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,800
right type of applications and services

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:32,710
and monetize it in the long run I think

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,320
I see open-source as a long term

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,050
investment in a way for the company just

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,880
like when the internet was first

00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:42,790
starting Cisco was very much involved

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,160
with IETF leading the technology they

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:47,500
didn't have to but they were they had an

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,360
interest in it lots of people spend lots

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,790
of time there it was a very loosely

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,880
coupled standards organization it still

00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:57,910
is that's why it's requests for comments

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,130
and not like some big ITU standard the

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:04,180
reason why Cisco contributed they wanted

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:06,400
to have the technical lead and they

00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,380
wanted to be the experts and they want

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,240
and they maintained that expertise

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,820
within the company and they knew exactly

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,730
what products to build on top of what

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:19,350
was discussed and the

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:21,870
open sources in a way the same way cisco

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,460
alone cannot build this big

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,070
infrastructure because it's a multi

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:30,030
vendor problem it has to be sold as a

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:34,260
multi vendor solution and it is an

00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:35,970
industry changing project in my opinion

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,430
it's very small and it's not very well

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,770
known yet but the fact is that people

00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:44,480
gave up on the problem that we're trying

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:47,910
to solve which is the collection and

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,630
presentation of a very high volume of

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,040
data in real time to the applications

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,290
applications and services are where the

00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,310
real interesting stuff is going to be we

00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,990
do have some IP by the way that we put

00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:03,330
protect through regular methods that

00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:06,210
doesn't stop us from filing for patterns

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:10,620
but you know making the code available

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:12,840
to other users and get the feedback I

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:17,150
think puts us in the right track for the

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,150
eventual real application landscape

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:30,420
excellent so we know a malicious here

00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:34,070
why are you here yes you you did raise

00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,070
your hand right okay good

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,810
so really quickly for the home audience

00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,610
the question was what other kinds of

00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:11,410
future projects do you think that Cisco

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,120
will be involved in going forward

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:19,140
what other kinds of things do you have

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:21,760
your eye on on the horizon I guess

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:27,430
anything to do with networking we have

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:29,980
our eyes on and the other thing that I

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,700
see across the company is the analytics

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,310
and apps

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,580
everybody has their eyes on that I don't

00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:40,420
know if it's been resolved and I am not

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:42,610
aware of project names to tell you but I

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,680
see a lot of moment towards data

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,660
analytics and applications and

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:56,980
especially in the networking area where

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:59,050
we have the expertise maybe this isn't

00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:03,330
really so much an open source project

00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,330
but a way of working with open source

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,230
I've been doing a lot of work with

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,480
standards with open source and cisco has

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,450
been very supportive and of me in doing

00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,160
that well trying to bring those two

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,780
things together combining open source

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,820
and standards and I think part of the

00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,500
thing there is there's a lot of

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,120
networking technology that's backed by

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,100
standards now there's a lot of work

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,590
being done in open source we really want

00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,650
to make sure open source works well with

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,810
those standards ipv6 support and

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,160
kubernetes is a good example take some

00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,420
of the stuff that came out of the IETF

00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,670
for networking

00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,770
make sure it works well with with open

00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,380
source I think you're gonna see more and

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,570
more of that so it's not kind of like

00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,100
you know here's the old way of doing

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,990
things or whatever that was more

00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,490
standards-based and now it's just it's

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,160
all open source and standards aren't

00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,540
needed I think it's in Cisco's best

00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,700
interest that those two worlds come

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,990
together and we'll continue to see more

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,730
work bringing those two worlds together

00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:12,210
we had a really quick question here

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,740
before we continue with this so I wanted

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,140
to actually elaborate I want you to

00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,960
elaborate on that I'm I confess I'm a

00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,320
standards guy am i work in the telco

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,360
industry so for telco and communications

00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,610
as we go to the software dominated

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,350
future what kind of things are best to

00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,820
do an open-source and what kind of

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,640
things are best to do in standards and

00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,500
like as a company where do you plan to

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:40,280
put energy in the open source versus and

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,280
it's establishing standards thank you

00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:56,670
so I would say yeah when I'm pushing for

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:59,130
is not so much in either or open source

00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:01,680
I would say work on it within the

00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,750
standards but then don't just work on it

00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,670
in the standards for three years and

00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,620
think the open source community is gonna

00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,120
wait for you two three years later come

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,280
out and say here's the standard now go

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,100
implement it know you start working on

00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,290
it the standards the in parallel doing

00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,270
open source reference implementations or

00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,790
an open source project implementation of

00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:23,940
it have the to feed off of each other so

00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:26,130
at the end of the day you not only have

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,720
the standard but you have an open source

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,600
implementation of it that people can

00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,690
start to use extend whatever you know

00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,800
bring in to meet their needs so yeah

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:40,920
that's the way I look at it I guess one

00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,790
thing I can add is that we want to see

00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:48,450
the standards making faster decisions

00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:52,710
adopting newer technologies and sister

00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:56,640
has a lot of interest all-seer actually

00:30:52,710 --> 00:31:00,000
does hackathons at IETF that's a new so

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,700
we're trying to really bring the

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,700
standards bodies up to you know today's

00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:08,360
standards in terms of agility and

00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,540
technology there is still a lot of

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:14,580
influence the standards bodies have and

00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:17,960
there's a lot of use for that I don't

00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,960
think we're ready to about

00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:53,230
yes I can tell you which one is more

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:56,049
sexier and you can guess I can just go

00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:57,820
back to Charles point of it's not one or

00:31:56,049 --> 00:32:01,170
the other it's doing both right is that

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:06,100
the standardization processes as long

00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:08,770
and I go back and look at Cisco's

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,890
history is okay let's work in a

00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:14,080
standards but let's develop this needed

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:17,140
functionality and then when the standard

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,770
is is ratified we will add that you know

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:23,860
VLAN tagging with ISL and then with 802

00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:27,160
dot1q a standardized every you know we

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,870
added support and 4.1 q and it

00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:34,299
eventually became the default instead of

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:36,520
is L for VLAN tagging how that relates

00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:39,100
open source it's going to be on a

00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:42,370
case-by-case basis right is this

00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:45,190
functionality that you know is being

00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:47,260
standardized but is also implemented

00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,710
well is that implemented in an open

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:53,650
source project that we're leveraging for

00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:55,900
for our products okay if so then let's

00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:57,490
go ahead and implement that standard in

00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,150
that open source project and then

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:05,410
consume that into into our product if

00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:08,740
it's vice versa and its functionality

00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:10,150
that's in our own software it's still

00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,549
the same approach just comes down to

00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:15,990
where do we actually then implement that

00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:15,990
standard open or closed

00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,430
yeah I mean it's it's I think it's a

00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:41,640
gray area a good example is CNI the

00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:44,520
container network interface you know

00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,440
it's not necessarily a standard it's an

00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,350
open-source project that's trying to

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,710
standardize on how containers interact

00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:55,200
with the you know with networking you

00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,440
know in a containerized environment you

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,020
know docker has lid network right and so

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,940
docker if you've got docker or dr. swarm

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,730
you use lid network if you've got

00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,350
kubernetes meso sand I mean see and I

00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:11,640
was really starting to be adopted but

00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:12,750
neither of them are standards do one of

00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,429
those eventually float up and be a

00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,550
standard you know I don't know I'm not

00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,500
involved in the Standards Committee but

00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,600
you know I think again just going back

00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,010
looking at history of okay we've we've

00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,919
got to implement this functionality

00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,090
somewhere preferably an open-source

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,030
software instead of close source

00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:33,870
software and let's make sure let's work

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:36,659
with the standards committees and try to

00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:40,440
bring about a standard that everyone can

00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:42,210
follow yeah so I think the other thing

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,419
is that it depends on the area right

00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:48,450
there is no point in for me to have an

00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:50,490
open-source project for bgp PGP is

00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,830
handled at IETF it's very well handled

00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:57,440
all the stakeholders are there that's

00:34:52,830 --> 00:35:01,640
the place to do now our my project is

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,560
routing streaming network analytics and

00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,780
we actually work very closely with IETF

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,630
because we use bgp monitoring protocol

00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,600
so that's not even really part of our

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:17,400
open-source engagement but I see if

00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:20,190
there was really no forum or area to

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,680
build this framework for us so it seemed

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,750
like the code piece really we had to

00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,750
take it out of the standards

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:30,240
otherwise we could never make progress

00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,690
it depends can you build the community

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:43,650
faster than the you know the standards

00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:45,750
groups to mobilize I think it depends in

00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,280
the NFV space right and then this is

00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,330
kind of the beginning although I guess

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,710
energy started like maybe five years ago

00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,180
there's been standards started and it

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,100
was going slow and now there's open

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,160
source multiple open source communities

00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,970
right and it's kind of a competition and

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,200
open source is different you can

00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,370
leverage it into your product and all

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,530
that stuff but if I look at it just from

00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:07,110
an interoperability and open this point

00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,750
of view some people say well as things

00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,450
get more software why write a spec on an

00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,590
API when you can just have code and then

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,370
you know it works right

00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:18,990
so for in terms of interoperability is

00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,850
there certain kind of things that are

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,770
best to just do an open source for

00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,270
interoperability or is it better to do

00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,710
than standards that protocols obviously

00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,380
you do instead I was gonna say for

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,030
protocols there's no point yeah I think

00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,280
looking at protocols is that actually a

00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,740
good example if you look at like like

00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,470
networking right I mean look at we have

00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:41,850
we have OBS we have open switch we have

00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:44,520
PPP we have proprietary implementations

00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:46,140
many many of them fortunately they can

00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,790
actually interoperate and coexist

00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,630
because there's those underlying

00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:53,610
standards so there's an example of you

00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,130
know perhaps one day there'll be one

00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:58,860
open-source switching platform at hopes

00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,840
that's PPP just you know rules

00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,370
everything and then the standards don't

00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,460
really matter cuz the whole world runs

00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,380
on VPP but you know maybe that's not

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,630
what's gonna happen and maybe there's

00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,610
gonna continue to be a mix so even with

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,550
open source implementations it's still

00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:17,640
fantastic having that standards basis

00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,960
behind them you know one for der to rule

00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:24,630
them all and in the darkness bind them

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:26,940
yes how many of you Mike thank you so

00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,550
just curious about your company's

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,560
open-source strategy so let's say you

00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:33,630
have an internal project you found it

00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,789
interesting and you consider to open

00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:38,009
source it so what the

00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:41,759
consideration before you open sources

00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:44,089
let's say the phyto work very very nice

00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,949
before you open source it what kind of

00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:48,419
what making you made you made a decision

00:37:46,949 --> 00:37:53,969
to open sources what are the

00:37:48,419 --> 00:37:58,859
considerations so normally I prefer that

00:37:53,969 --> 00:38:02,669
the panel answer and we will imply

00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:03,869
threat intended but I really actually

00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:05,219
address this one a little more directly

00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:07,849
because I was very intimately involved

00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:10,769
in the open sourcing of EPP and Fido um

00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:14,399
a ssin that I have repeatedly with

00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:17,729
executives inside Cisco is bringing back

00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:19,979
the fine point that we're in the

00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:23,549
business from a Cisco perspective of

00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:26,999
creating value and we have a historical

00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:29,789
tendency to think about clutching

00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:32,489
intellectual property is the only way to

00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:34,889
create value and the truth of the matter

00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:37,019
is that it is often the case that you

00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:41,659
create more of business value in your

00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:44,999
company by letting go of certain things

00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:48,029
so you can look at the landscape and say

00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:49,949
ok there are market transitions that are

00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:53,159
happening where customers demanding that

00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:55,139
things are based on open platforms based

00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,399
on open source software they're not

00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:58,049
saying that they won't pay you for

00:38:56,399 --> 00:39:00,599
things they're saying that they don't

00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:03,389
want to be locked in you have places

00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,769
where the innovation that it's necessary

00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:06,839
to make it through the complex

00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:08,549
transitions that we're dealing with more

00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:11,549
and more quickly like the transitions to

00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:13,949
cloud native and micro services can't be

00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:15,179
done by any one single vendor we have to

00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:18,859
have a place that we can collaborate

00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:22,699
together on them and so you build a case

00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:24,749
around the value creation of letting go

00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:27,529
now then there's a whole lot of

00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:30,239
mechanics around things like making

00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:32,459
really certain that you are completely

00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,779
beyond reproach in terms of the

00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:36,299
Providence of the code that you release

00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:37,889
I can't tell you how many annoying code

00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:39,569
scans that I've read through just to

00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:42,869
make sure the endless array of false

00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:44,249
positives were in false in fact false so

00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:46,290
there's a lot of mechanics to it as well

00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:48,780
but the fundamental thing that has to be

00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:50,600
doubt is what is the business value case

00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,710
that you make you to your executives and

00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,780
how do you help them make that

00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,930
transition into the new world of

00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,340
thinking about things and now back to

00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,590
the implied threat to the panel yeah

00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,110
I'll give you another example that it

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,820
goes back to the way I came into Cisco I

00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,920
mentioned getting started an open source

00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,100
at fo Vida and we were open sourcing

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,600
everything and Cisco acquired us and

00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,750
after they acquired us now they had to

00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,210
decide what to do with this code and

00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,790
Cisco wanted to have a voice over IP

00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,080
solution and but they decided you know

00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:24,960
what these guys are already open

00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,270
sourcing stuff we're going to continue

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,100
to open source it because yes what we

00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:33,720
want to develop a voice over IP and

00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:36,330
hopefully a video IP solution we we want

00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,190
that whole industry to grow so we want

00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:40,680
to put all this stuff out it's like a

00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:44,430
toolkit to help other straight voice

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,710
over IP solutions because if there's if

00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:50,040
the industry moves from traditional

00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,720
telephony to over IP that's good for

00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,150
Cisco we sell more routers and switches

00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,150
we'll make money on that if we also sell

00:40:54,150 --> 00:41:00,480
the best voice over IP solution great if

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:02,280
someone else does great so let's put it

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,170
out there as open-source so that was a

00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,150
decision way back then on that open

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,100
source project and just another way you

00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,890
can look at it what is it where are you

00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:14,550
driving value from and that can

00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:15,900
influence your decision just really

00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,780
quick one thing I wanted to add there is

00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,940
there's also a benefit to open sourcing

00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,620
things which is you can assuming that

00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,090
you can build a developer community

00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,770
around the technology you can actually

00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,770
accelerate development and innovation

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,150
all right so um we love you people up

00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,090
front but we haven't heard from the

00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:45,560
people in the back so why are you in

00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:47,650
here they're in the back come on don't

00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,650
be shy

00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:54,520
that's a good answer

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:04,760
you want to see something okay awesome

00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:07,310
anyone else in the back why are you here

00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,340
I know some of you I can guess don't

00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:16,580
make me guess

00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:29,119
go on okay I'm very close to calling

00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:31,580
names so to volunteer yes so I'm here

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,010
because I'm curious to hear some of your

00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,050
stories I know we don't have much time

00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,820
but what what is the the hardest

00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:40,339
experience you've gone through trying to

00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:44,830
convince people about open source within

00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:44,830
the company and why it's so important

00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:58,430
[Music]

00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:03,769
so the question is what was the hardest

00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:07,670
thing about going open-source to explain

00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:10,630
the value why we're doing it why we want

00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:14,539
to do it and this more future-looking

00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:16,400
aspect of the open sourcing what it will

00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:20,119
bring to the company because you know

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,339
it's a traditional company everybody is

00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,140
used to building a product and selling

00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:25,729
it and you're done and you collect the

00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,739
money but now we live in a very

00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:31,479
different world of you know

00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:34,910
subscriptions and memberships and

00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:36,499
services and we're going through that

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,829
transition just like any other big

00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:42,469
company and we had to convince that this

00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:44,930
was the right way for us to proceed and

00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:47,599
we had to have conversations about how

00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,969
we're gonna bring back money and value

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,700
to the company through open source but

00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:54,559
it's a it's a lot of tension in the

00:43:52,700 --> 00:44:00,469
company and I think it's a very healthy

00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:02,210
tension it has to happen I think another

00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:04,309
thing that's challenging is to have

00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:06,410
people just you know kind of bite off

00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:08,420
that chunk of work of open sourcing

00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,089
you're not just open sourcing but open

00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,009
sourcing say correctly right it's

00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:14,809
because the last thing we want to have

00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:16,700
people do is just throw open-source out

00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:18,200
there and then be like yeah yeah you

00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,549
know we don't care about that I remember

00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,710
someone saying like okay well we were

00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:24,349
working on this and now we decided we're

00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:26,630
gonna you know cut that project on our

00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:29,950
team but we're gonna open source it and

00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,950
hope that the community takes it over

00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:35,150
he's not always not the only way we're

00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:37,009
gonna open source this is if you agree

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,809
you're actually gonna put more people on

00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:41,049
it so we can help develop a community

00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:43,940
around it so I think getting people to

00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:45,799
to think about that and understand the

00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,079
value the real value of open-source is

00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:49,460
that they're good open-source community

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,710
members and they open source

00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,180
you know correctly I think it's just one

00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:54,710
of the biggest challenges because

00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,380
oftentimes once you start talking about

00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,050
that then you end up you know scaring

00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,630
them away

00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:02,220
you know so I think that's that's one of

00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:05,610
the tough balances also we don't have

00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,620
the cleanest spotter huge understatement

00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:09,720
have the cleanest open-source

00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,820
contribution process really it's not the

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,710
most streamlined and not easy to

00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,540
navigate so a lot of people just don't

00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,430
want to fight off that complication of

00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,170
you know having to do the right thing

00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,210
check with other business units to make

00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,680
sure that they're not you know you're

00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,620
not killing their business model or

00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,630
whatever do the right do diligence

00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:31,940
that's to get people to open source

00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,940
correctly is still can be a challenge

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,950
okay so we have just been told by our

00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,170
lovely minders that we have hit our time

00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,060
so I want to thank our distinguished

00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,920
panelists for their contributions to the

00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,390
conversation it's been excellent I'd

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,880
like to thank you as the audience for

00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:48,960
participating as part of the panel and I

00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,970
would like to thank everyone for

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,470
indulging my impish desire to see if I

00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,620
could run an entire panel on a single

00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:56,900
word

00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,900
