	Keynote: The Difference Between a Crowd and a Community - Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Actor, Founder and Director of HITRECORD

Joseph Gordon-Levitt, founder and director of the online collaborative production company HITRECORD, delivers a Keynote presentation with video elements, featuring his views on the evolution of the Internet as a collaborative medium, and key technological lessons learned since the Company’s launch 9 years ago.  The online entrepreneur discusses the three pillars of today’s Internet that he views as limiting to our ability to come together and be creative, and offers alternatives to collectively approach technology for a more productive and collaborative future.

These solutions are guided by principles Joseph has discovered organically over years of building, growing and directing the HITRECORD community. In this presentation, he explores both principles and solutions via an animated Keynote presentation, and a brief video example from the Company’s television show “HIT RECORD ON TV.”  This presentation shines a light on critical issues facing Internet culture today, and offers realistic solutions with a positive vision for the future of the Web.
