Title: Keynote: The Difference Between a Crowd and a Community - Joseph Gordon-Levitt
Publication date: 2017-09-12
Playlist: Open Source Summit North America 2017
Description: 
	Keynote: The Difference Between a Crowd and a Community - Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Actor, Founder and Director of HITRECORD

Joseph Gordon-Levitt, founder and director of the online collaborative production company HITRECORD, delivers a Keynote presentation with video elements, featuring his views on the evolution of the Internet as a collaborative medium, and key technological lessons learned since the Company’s launch 9 years ago.  The online entrepreneur discusses the three pillars of today’s Internet that he views as limiting to our ability to come together and be creative, and offers alternatives to collectively approach technology for a more productive and collaborative future.

These solutions are guided by principles Joseph has discovered organically over years of building, growing and directing the HITRECORD community. In this presentation, he explores both principles and solutions via an animated Keynote presentation, and a brief video example from the Company’s television show “HIT RECORD ON TV.”  This presentation shines a light on critical issues facing Internet culture today, and offers realistic solutions with a positive vision for the future of the Web.

About Joseph Gordon-Levitt
Joseph Gordon-Levitt's acting career spans the last three decades, and ranges from television (3rd Rock From The Sun) to arthouse (Mysterious Skin, Brick) to multiplex (Inception, 500 Days Of Summer, Snowden).

hello everybody oh I'm really excited to

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,750
do this today this is I've done a number

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,680
of these talks and this crowd is

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,890
actually I think extremely applicable to

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,529
to what we do with hit record and and in

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,660
fact sort of the the open source and

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,029
freeware movement is in many ways a

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,199
loose inspiration for how we make art on

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,900
hit record so I'm really really

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,960
interested to talk to you guys and see

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,730
what you think of some of these ideas

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,079
because I think you'll probably have

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,750
spent more time thinking about these

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,430
kinds of things than most crowds that I

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,320
talked to about this kind of stuff so

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,719
thanks for being here I'm excited to do

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,469
this and thanks to the Linux Foundation

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,899
for the opportunity alright so when I

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,890
was six years old I started working as

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,809
an actor I looked like that and I was

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,800
working in TV and movies and stuff and I

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,570
loved it

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,840
I always really loved it even at that

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,309
age and and I I feel lucky that I got to

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,560
keep doing it throughout adolescence I

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,409
was working and stuff and then when I

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,380
was 19 I quit so that I could go to

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,830
college and I did that for about 20

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,310
minutes

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,450
and then when I wanted to get back into

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,950
acting I couldn't get a job no one would

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,830
give me a part and this was actually

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,130
really painful because I wanted to be

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,900
creative but I couldn't be and and at

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,360
that point I realized that I needed to

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,610
take responsibility from my own creative

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,409
outlet I couldn't wait around for

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,060
someone to give me a job I had to be

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,630
able to express myself and make things

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,299
of my own volition and and I even came

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,759
up with with a little a little phrase to

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,180
sort of encapsulate this idea and that

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,310
phrase was hit record because I always

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,759
had a thing for like the the red circle

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,110
record button on a video camera and and

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,899
it became a sort of symbol to me to push

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,399
that button to hit record meant to you

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,180
know to get started and buckle down and

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,520
and do it and make something so I did I

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,959
started you know writing stories and

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,319
making little videos and recording songs

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,090
and and then when I wanted to share some

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,829
the stuff of the world my brother helped

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,980
me set up this tiny little website and

00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:21,840
we called it hit record org okay so now

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,689
this is where his work gets interesting

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,249
as people started coming to this website

00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:28,249
which at this point was it was just a

00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:32,400
little like you know when those PHP

00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:34,920
prefab message boards but even at that

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,599
small scale what we noticed was there

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,280
were some people who came just to check

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,540
out the stuff that I had done and then

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,329
there were some people who wanted to

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,730
just post the stuff that they had done

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:47,430
but then there were some people whose

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,950
natural tendency was to make things

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,290
together both with me and with each

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,629
other and and my brother and I thought

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,340
now that's that's cool that's something

00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:59,879
that like wouldn't have been possible

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,760
any other time in history before the

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,739
Internet and and this is what I want to

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,099
talk about today right is how people can

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,919
form a community online to be creative

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,560
together you guys know a lot about this

00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,260
if you're writing code together but in

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,180
in my world of sort of art whether it's

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,689
making videos or music or creative

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,560
writing etc most creativity that happens

00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:27,030
online isn't isn't like that because a

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,790
lot of what happens online when it comes

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,090
to creativity is sort of people sharing

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,199
things that they've made on their own

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,689
but what I'm talking about is people

00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:39,299
making things together that they

00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:42,269
couldn't have made on their own so that

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,750
was ten years ago that we set up that

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:47,549
little PHP message board and since then

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,930
hit record community is it's grown quite

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,659
a lot and we've done some really cool

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,220
things I do say so myself you know we've

00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,720
we've screened our short films at film

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,579
festivals and we've published books and

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,349
we put out records and we put on live

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,959
events and venues all around the world

00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,239
and we made a television show that won

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,759
an Emmy and whenever one of these

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,939
productions turned a profit we paid our

00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,799
contributing artists fairly and so over

00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,750
the years I feel like I've learned some

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,840
things about what it takes for an online

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,039
community to be creative together and so

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,199
today what I want to do is talk about

00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:22,529
some of the things that we've learned

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,960
and here's the thing I love the internet

00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,860
we all love the Internet obviously the

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,330
Internet is you

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,050
an incredibly positive thing for the

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,120
world in many many ways but I do think

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,120
there are some things about today's

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,919
online culture that limit our abilities

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,840
to come together and be creative and

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,180
again I think it's important to

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,000
distinguish today that when I say online

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,710
culture I'm not talking about the online

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,099
culture on github I'm talking about the

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:54,349
online culture like you know on say

00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:58,500
YouTube or you know Jim or I guess

00:04:54,349 --> 00:05:01,500
general culture on the internet so I

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,300
want to bring up three sort of things

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,069
that happen on the internet a lot I'm

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,740
gonna call them sort of like pillars of

00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:14,879
today's Internet and they are the crowd

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:17,550
free culture and socializing all right

00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,650
so let me dive into each of these first

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,840
of all the crowd okay so obviously we've

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,360
all heard of crowdsourcing we've all

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,150
heard about the power of the crowd I'll

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,690
bring up two main kinds of crowdsourcing

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,940
happening today first kind I'd call big

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,500
data driven crowdsourcing right so this

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,750
is where huge number of people provide

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,979
their data without it costing them any

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,440
effort sometimes without them even

00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,940
realizing that it's happening and then a

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,289
computer program is able to take all

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,169
that data and do something useful with

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,339
it right so like ways for example that

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,560
amalgamates maximum amount of

00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,089
user-generated data to provide traffic

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,639
information okay so that's one kind of

00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:55,740
crowdsourcing and and this kind of

00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,430
crowdsourcing it can be very useful for

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:02,879
sort of high-volume technical tasks like

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:07,319
providing traffic information but it's

00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:08,699
not really good at anything creative all

00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,460
right the second kind of crowdsourcing

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:15,509
is what I would call an open contest and

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,029
so this is where there's a task that

00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,819
needs doing and anyone can submit their

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,339
attempt at achieving that task and then

00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:26,189
someone picks a winner and then the

00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,960
winner gets some kind of reward one

00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:30,240
example of this is the company XPrize

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,120
and they've accomplished some terrific

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,029
things definitely creative things like

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,069
they created a reusable suborbital

00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,630
spaceship or they were you know working

00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,700
on innovative solutions to clean

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,190
oil spills and things like that so and

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,030
they do this by offering big cash prizes

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,410
to the winners of their competitions and

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,510
it's it's wonderful that they're getting

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:55,590
stuff like this done

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:57,960
now obviously contests like this they've

00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,430
been around for ages right and using the

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,630
Internet to run a contest like this

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,220
that's a step in the right direction

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,360
because a greater number of people get

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:09,030
to contribute but the limitation is that

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,670
all those people they're not really

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,020
working together in fact they're working

00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,110
against each other

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,850
so if one person over here has a good

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,820
idea that doesn't help this person over

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,800
here right in fact it it harms this

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,530
other person because it hurts their

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,150
chances of winning the contest so what

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,560
this doesn't take advantage of is what

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,110
would happen if all these people could

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,270
put their heads together in an organized

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,500
way and could they accomplish something

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:39,030
greater than they could on their own I

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,160
think they could and you guys know that

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,190
they can because again the open source

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:48,710
software movement is really the best

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:54,330
example of that ever happening so that's

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:55,860
what I would call the crowd next pillar

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,710
of the Internet I want to talk about is

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,340
is free culture this is something I'm

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,620
sure all you guys think about a lot it's

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,960
a given now right all of the world's

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,810
culture art literature science

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,030
journalism etc it's all available for

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,310
free online which is obviously awesome

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,080
and the biggest example of this is of

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,450
course Google anything we want to know

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,090
or see or hear you know we can just

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:27,420
google it and there it is right away for

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:30,750
free but again I do think that this kind

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,250
of free culture it puts some limits on

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,140
our ability to be creative together

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:39,599
online and now I acknowledge the laws

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,390
surrounding intellectual property and

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,640
copyright in this country are antiquated

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,050
I think they are and they probably need

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,630
reform and in fact the phrase that I'm

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,150
using for this section of the talk free

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,440
culture that's the title of a book maybe

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,580
you some of you guys have read by a

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,650
great legal thinker call

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,200
Lawrence Lessig was very critical of

00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,030
today's copyright laws and and I agree

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,160
with him

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:06,810
however I also firmly believe in a basic

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,820
principle that if someone does some work

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,310
and create some kind of intellectual

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,260
property and then that intellectual

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,160
property is able to generate any kind of

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:20,520
revenue then that creator deserves some

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,280
of that money seems like common sense to

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,410
me I know not all of the licenses in in

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,040
the open-source movement work that way I

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:32,970
think some do and some don't

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,860
that's my personal take on it is again

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,100
if if someone does some work and that

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,240
work generates money I think the person

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,990
who did the work deserves some of that

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,550
money unfortunately this is often not

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,530
what's happening online today in the

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,710
context of free culture and and and I'm

00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,660
again I'm not really talking about the

00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,850
open source software movement I'm

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,470
talking about free culture like all that

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,380
journalism and art and literature and

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,360
stuff that you get for free online when

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,620
you google something because there's

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,700
there's another book about this kind of

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,110
thing which I don't know if you guys

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,520
have read but this is to me a really

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,620
interesting book you might like it's

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,490
called who owns the future by Jaron

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,830
Lanier and what mr. lennier says is all

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,330
that stuff that you Google and that

00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,450
Google is sort of serving you up for

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,890
free well it's not really free because

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,570
there's money being generated in that

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,250
transaction because at the same time as

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,560
it serves you the free content it's also

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,530
serving you advertisements right the

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,790
problem is that none of that ad money is

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,440
going to the creator of the content

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,820
that's being served all that money is

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,160
just going to Google now this business

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,500
model has pretty much decimated the

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,820
music industry granted the music

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,330
industry sorta had it coming in a lot of

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,280
ways but the truth is it's a lot harder

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,160
nowadays to earn an honest living as a

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,160
musician than it used to be same things

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,540
happening in the field of journalism

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,580
right especially more long-form

00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,770
investigative journalism as local and

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,570
regional news organizations all over the

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,640
world are having a harder time staying

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,070
in business then highly skilled

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,610
professional journalists are finding

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,059
themselves out of a job

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:12,399
mr. lennier predicts that this damage

00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:13,989
won't stop with the music and journalism

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,449
industries and as more and more

00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:18,279
industries become more and more based in

00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:21,429
digital information as they inevitably

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:24,970
will those industries will be just as

00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:27,839
damaged by this notion that intellectual

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,369
property is supposed to be free because

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,529
if you spend your time and effort making

00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:34,989
something but the only ones getting paid

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:37,720
for your time and effort are a few giant

00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:41,069
tech companies I think that's going to

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,920
disincentivize your creativity

00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,959
obviously that's complicated and there

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,489
are more incentives for creativity than

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,720
just making money and this room of

00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:54,939
people understands that probably better

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,949
than anyone but still I think if we're

00:11:54,939 --> 00:12:00,249
gonna figure out how to kind of move

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:02,139
forward in this kind of future of making

00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:05,259
things together we have to figure out

00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:08,100
how to get people paid for doing it work

00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:10,420
so that's that's free culture right

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,399
third third thing I want to talk about

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,139
third pillar of the internet today's

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,769
internet is what I would call

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,629
socializing and again just like the

00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:22,559
other two there there are huge upsides

00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:26,649
to what goes on via social networks or

00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,569
social media I always feel a little like

00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:33,489
cringy just saying the word social media

00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:34,959
but there's there are real upsides to it

00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:36,759
right people are able to connect with

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,679
each other from all over the world and

00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,449
and share their lives and their

00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,929
perspectives with one another and and it

00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:45,160
can be really beautiful and of course

00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,079
the prime examples of this are like

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:52,419
Facebook Twitter etc other things like

00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:55,119
them but as legitimate as the upsides

00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:57,879
are I also think that this kind of

00:12:55,119 --> 00:13:00,839
socializing online it's limited in its

00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:03,910
ability to facilitate substantial

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,089
creativity because these platforms

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,970
aren't built for that github is built

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,759
for that Facebook is not you know

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,789
they're they're they're built for

00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:18,429
socializing they're not conducive to

00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:19,640
elaborate or complex or nuanced

00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,990
processes or

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,430
interactions like when you check your

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,930
feet on Instagram for example you're

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,010
just scrolling you're scrolling from one

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,910
thing to the next thing to the next

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,040
thing to the next thing

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,170
you're never focusing on anything for

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,000
very long and by the way that's how

00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,260
these companies make money right the

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,560
more items you scroll through the more

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,480
ads you see more money they make so it's

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,500
in their interest to keep your attention

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,260
span short Facebook's landing page

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,180
invites you to connect with your friends

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,620
and the world around you and again I

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,420
think people connecting with each other

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,220
that's a great thing it really is my

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,770
question is are there ways to take it a

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,460
step further past just connecting with

00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,870
each other and towards creating together

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,480
and of course I think so and I think you

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,700
guys know so if you're participating in

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,470
you know the create the open source

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,910
creation of software together you're

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,890
doing stuff online that's more than just

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:14,710
socializing you're making stuff together

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:17,330
and that to me is is really exciting so

00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,860
now we talked about these three sort of

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:23,420
pillars of the Internet the crowd free

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:25,130
culture socializing and again there's

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,290
there's more than these three but these

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,360
three are just three prominent things

00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,060
and I want to re-emphasize I really do

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,700
think that all three of these things are

00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,770
positive in their own right but given

00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,910
their limitations that we just talked

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,610
about when it comes to collaborative

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:46,160
creativity I want to propose three

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:47,420
alternative pillars and they are oh and

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,250
I should say I'm not just making these

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,600
up right these are these are sort of

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,640
three principles that we've arrived at

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,510
organically over the years and building

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,010
and running hit record okay so first

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,070
instead of thinking about the crowd what

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,460
if we think about community second

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,560
instead of thinking about free culture

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:12,830
what if we think about fair compensation

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:17,830
and third instead of socializing what if

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:20,300
we think about collaborating all right

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,220
so I'm gonna talk about each of these

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,770
principles and and then I'm just gonna

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,710
show you a bit about how we apply them

00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:30,950
on hit record so first community as

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,300
opposed to the crowd all right so to me

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,160
the biggest difference between a

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,300
community

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:41,379
and a crowd is every member of community

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,290
is a unique individual so the strength

00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:47,319
of that community someone might

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:49,899
appreciate that the strength of a

00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:52,180
community is less about the quantity of

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,620
the people and more about the quality of

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,009
their contributions and their

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,649
interactions now on hitRECord community

00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:02,730
is the most important thing to us

00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,850
in fact sometimes we get called a

00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,560
crowdsourced

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:08,560
production company and I'm always like

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,970
hmm I prefer to call it a community

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,519
sourced production company and I know

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,110
that sort of a ticky-tack difference but

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,949
to me I just I just feel kind of rude

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,509
calling our community a crowd it feels

00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:21,459
like you know I'd be failing to

00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:23,319
acknowledge all the unique individuals

00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:27,279
and their unique contributions that make

00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:29,199
our company what it is so we can go back

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,279
to the two kinds of crowdsourcing that I

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,050
was talking about earlier and we could

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,610
see the hit record doesn't really fit

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,279
into either one of these there's the big

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,790
data driven kind of crowdsourcing but at

00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,040
least for now

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,259
there aren't any number crunching

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,990
algorithms deep enough to match human

00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,600
creative expression you know counting

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:50,139
the number of likes can't replace a

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:53,079
talented curator with good taste so

00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:55,060
again for now and I say for now because

00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,740
I know there's you know probably a lot

00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,769
of AI fans in this crowd they're like

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:04,240
it's gonna happen there will be robot

00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:07,209
novelists and there probably will be but

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,850
for now they're not here yet and you

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:14,860
know a big data driven algorithm can't

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:16,630
do what our community does other type of

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,199
crowdsourcing that we talked about was

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,819
what we call the open contest and on hit

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,390
record we say it all the time this is

00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:27,250
not a contest it's a collaboration and

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,380
we really try to emphasize that we're

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,080
all working together towards a common

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,370
goal one of the most important ways we

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,350
do this is with a methodology we call

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,630
remix this would be something very

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,190
familiar to coders this is exactly what

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,190
you guys do when you use okay I'm going

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,539
to take someone else's I'm not technical

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,220
enough I'm not a coder someone else's

00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,559
library someone else's function someone

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,740
else's class

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:53,730
was that like old anyway what do you

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,620
care what do you call it now and you use

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,600
it to make something of your own right

00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,220
that's what we call a remix so like on

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,840
our site one way that that would happen

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,610
is someone like uploads a simple drawing

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,230
and then someone takes that drawing and

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:09,870
turns it into an animation that we would

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,639
call a remix the drawings gonna come up

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,769
and then that drawings gonna turn did it

00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:14,850
already happen there's the drawing this

00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:16,139
is something that happened on our site

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,480
and this kind of thing happens all the

00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:19,980
time right someone will take that

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,990
drawing and then turn it into an

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,179
animation that's the that's that's how

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:28,559
we make things together so like

00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,179
someone's personal story for example

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,669
that could get remixed into a script and

00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,860
then other artists like actors or

00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:36,529
illustrators or animators musicians they

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,879
might build off that script to produce

00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:40,409
to produce a finished short film and

00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:42,720
then that short film might become part

00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:44,249
of a television show etc that's that's

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,960
how we make things and this how a bunch

00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:48,240
of smaller contributions from different

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,360
people can all add up to finish products

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,190
again I know I keep saying this you guys

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,899
inherently understand this most crowds

00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,629
that I talk to are like wait what how

00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:58,710
how could of whole people from whole

00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:00,799
bunch of people from all over the world

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:05,909
actually work together to make something

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:08,879
you guys understand that so this process

00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:11,460
of people remix in each other it's quite

00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:13,200
different from contests right in our

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,730
community if someone if someone over

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,289
here has a good idea well then this

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:20,519
person over here can build on top of

00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:21,929
that idea and you know maybe they can

00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,259
build on top of that idea in ways that

00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:27,960
the first person never anticipated and

00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:29,519
everyone's working together so when we

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,769
finish something on hit record like a

00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,039
short film or a song or whatever you

00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,379
know it's not just a winning entry from

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,110
a lone competitor all of our finished

00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:42,419
work it's been touched by lots of

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,799
contributors and they're all remix in

00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,509
each other they're all in the same team

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,580
they're all part of one community and

00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:48,779
and that facilitates the kind of

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,850
creativity that I've been talking about

00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:56,580
that would have been possible before the

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:59,460
Internet okay so that's community the

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,150
next alternative pillar I'm going to

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,860
call fair

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,200
sensation right and this is in contrast

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,460
to free culture and again I know that

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,340
this is something you guys think a lot

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,380
about when you're determining which

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,390
license is going to go with what project

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:19,560
in you know in in the open-source

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:21,150
context so I said it before I think it

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,710
bears repeating and I know this is

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,680
probably somewhat controversial in this

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,750
room but I personally believe that if

00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,000
someone does some work and that work

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,510
somehow generates some money then that

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,010
person deserves some of that money now

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,900
on hit record anytime one of our

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,970
productions makes money everyone whose

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,430
contribution is included in the final

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:46,470
version gets some of that money now

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:48,750
figuring out what's fair and which

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,970
artists get how much money that's no

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,700
small feat but we have an open and

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:55,670
collaborative process for that too we've

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,340
been doing it this way for six years now

00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,600
we still haven't been sued and we've

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,580
paid more than two million dollars to

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,030
contributors in our community from all

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,030
around the world

00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:15,629
so there's a great quote it's actually

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:17,489
attributed to Walt Disney that I like to

00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:20,519
say when when we talk about money on hit

00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:21,779
record and I bet this would resonate

00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,820
with you guys too

00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,009
and it's that we don't make movies to

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:31,049
make money we make money to make more

00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:33,389
movies which to me just says like just

00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:35,129
because you're not motivated by the

00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:36,299
money you know you're you might be

00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:39,389
motivated because you love what you're

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,950
doing but I still think there's a place

00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:44,999
that money has to kind of fit into it

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:47,009
just to sustain the thing because people

00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:48,329
are happy to get paid in our community

00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:50,399
but I honestly think that for most of

00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:51,959
them it's not about the money it's the

00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:53,369
principle it's that they feel that their

00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:56,459
time and their effort have been fairly

00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:57,869
acknowledged and compensated I think

00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:58,559
that's a big part of what allows our

00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:03,179
community

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:07,049
to be so productive together so that's

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:09,719
fair compensation alright lastly as

00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:12,719
opposed to socializing I want to talk

00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:16,919
about collaborating and what I mean by

00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:19,499
this is people connecting online not

00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,029
just to socialize through bite-sized

00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:23,279
interactions but to work together

00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:24,959
towards a common goal to be productive

00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,899
to be creative again this is something

00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:29,429
you guys know a lot about in fact I

00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:32,369
would like to learn from you guys about

00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:34,259
how you do it because on hit record this

00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:36,450
is what we're all about is collaboration

00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:38,940
it's people making things together on

00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,549
our landing page we say we're a new kind

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,969
of online community working together as

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,979
a production company so one of the

00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:48,959
biggest ways we achieve this is through

00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:51,119
our user experience of our web app and

00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:52,739
our mobile app so when you come to hit

00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,649
record you'll find some things in common

00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:57,029
with most social media platforms like

00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:58,139
you can post content or you can heart

00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:00,119
things that you like or you can

00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:03,029
subscribe to other users but you'll also

00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,889
find a lot of differences maybe these

00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,759
differences have more overlap with like

00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:10,049
a github than they do with an Instagram

00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:13,079
so anyone can issue what we call a

00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:14,609
creative challenge for example maybe

00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,440
it's a writing challenge or photography

00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:17,729
challenge etc and then writers or

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,759
photographers they can find those

00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:22,469
challenges and contribute to them and

00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,250
then you can organize a series of

00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,620
challenges in

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,090
what we call a project so you can set

00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,010
deadlines in your project or you can

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,380
send out updates and then as you get

00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,820
contributions to the creative challenges

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,790
that you're happy with you can cross out

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,130
those challenges that are done and then

00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,610
we in the creative Department at the

00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,380
hitRECord

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,050
office we maintain what we call our

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:46,530
project development slate so there's a

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:48,600
front-facing list it's a list of

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:52,710
outstanding projects that we've decided

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:55,080
to focus on as a production company we

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,030
categorize these projects into three

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,260
columns you can see there's sort of an

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,440
early stage of development we call

00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,240
concept development then we move it into

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,330
what we call advanced development and

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,920
then if and when we're able to secure a

00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,020
distribution or some other kind of

00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:14,130
monetization for the project then we put

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,710
it into the funded column now of course

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:19,680
the technology alone won't necessarily

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:22,290
get people to collaborate equally

00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,530
important we found is how we as a

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,150
company use the technology because this

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:31,860
whole model it doesn't work without

00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:37,350
leadership so the director of hitRECord

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:40,650
is me I think you guys call it BD FL if

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:42,150
I'm not mistaken I just learned that and

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,190
it's funny because I actually went when

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,900
I heard that what B DFL stood for I was

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,100
like oh that's actually something I say

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,830
on a record I'm like this is not a

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,120
democracy it's a benevolent dictatorship

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,800
and that and that's important because

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,110
there has to be someone who has the

00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,340
final say when you're you know working

00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,480
on something together and I'm I'm the

00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,010
one with the final say on how our

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,310
productions turn out but I don't make

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,460
these decisions alone far from it

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:09,000
there's of course our intrepid staff

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:11,790
that's our staff on on Halloween and and

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,040
then we also tap quite a few individual

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,490
members of the community who've proven

00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,810
themselves in talent and dedication so

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,610
those are people out there who you know

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,080
don't work for us but are just you know

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,780
great members of our community and they

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,780
really help a lot too and between all of

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,130
us we provide enough direction to make

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:32,429
sure that the entire community is

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,770
working together as a cohesive whole now

00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:37,170
do people in our community make friends

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:40,650
yes and and do they care about

00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,090
yes quite a lot but they don't care

00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,830
about each other just because you know

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,930
they've seen photos of each other's

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,970
respective lunch orders from that day

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,370
they care about each other cuz they're

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,680
engaged in an intimate and creative

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,180
process together and then the fact that

00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,600
they're also friends it only just helps

00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:01,110
them collaborate all the better

00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,970
so that's collaborating now having told

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,310
you about all that I actually think the

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,930
best way for you to really kind of

00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:09,570
understand it is just for me to give you

00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:12,060
an example so I'm gonna briefly take you

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,310
through one of the short films that we

00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,350
made for our television show and talk a

00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:18,270
bit about how we made it and then I'm

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,890
gonna play it for you so this is a short

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:25,530
film called first stars I see tonight it

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:28,830
started with a challenge to tell a story

00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:30,510
about your first time you know could be

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,480
your first time doing anything that's

00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:37,140
what a challenge looks like on the site

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,060
and so there's one contributor told this

00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,430
extraordinary story about her real life

00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,910
about how she was 16 years old the first

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:47,640
time she ever saw the stars right I

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,620
thought that was really cool I took her

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,990
piece of writing and I remixed it made

00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:55,590
it about half the length and then I

00:26:51,990 --> 00:27:00,470
issued another challenge for voice-over

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:02,400
artists to read her story out loud

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:06,840
that's what the voice-over challenge

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,060
looked like next we shot actors in front

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,670
of a green screen acting out the story

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:16,610
and we posted that green screen footage

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:18,780
on the site so it's not finished at all

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,920
just posted the green screen footage on

00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,440
the site and then we issued new

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,870
challenges to illustrators and animators

00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,770
to fill in the graphical world around

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:30,360
the actors those are those challenges

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:31,950
last thing we did was issue another

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,420
challenge to composers to write the

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:38,940
score and even after that new challenges

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:43,290
for musicians to play the score that had

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:46,080
been composed so was all finished we had

00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:49,140
put together 66 different pieces of

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,460
content out of 1443 that were

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,260
contributed

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,090
and it all added up to this beautiful

00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,779
short film that I want to play for you

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:59,039
right now so for the moment just pretend

00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:02,159
we're not at a tech conference and that

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,350
we're like at a film festival and this

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,360
isn't too long but it's something I'm

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,570
proud of and I hope you enjoy it it's

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:15,210
called first stars I see tonight

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:19,090
[Music]

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:22,929
when I was 16 I saw the Milky Way for

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:25,500
the first time I was 6 months old when I

00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:28,660
was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,900
I'm lucky the tape that I have is not

00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:34,870
the most vicious or devastating it means

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,390
that I'm light blind that my peripheral

00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,620
vision is slowly narrowing into a

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:45,330
pinhole and that my depth perception is

00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,330
gradually flattening away to nothing

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,810
my cousins and I used to go out and lie

00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,570
on sleeping bags in the back of a pickup

00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:56,490
truck and watch meteor showers they

00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,680
would watch I would stand up into the

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,740
black sky and study the seven bright

00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:07,630
points of light that I could see and

00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:10,179
wonder what it was like then my dad

00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,950
my father ordered a pair of Russian

00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:15,160
night-vision goggles from a military

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,900
surplus catalog he said he wanted to

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,429
watch his sprinklers at night and make

00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,940
sure they didn't get plugged by debris

00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:26,020
in the irrigation water but he also knew

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:29,140
what gift it would be for me when the

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,660
package arrived I spent the day reading

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:36,940
the instructions over and over again

00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:39,940
waiting for me to fall then finally the

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,860
Sun went down dad turned off her yard

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,860
light and we went outside

00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:54,110
I put on the goggles and looked up into

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:56,279
the sky it was a personal medical

00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,649
stretching above me and uncountable

00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,940
points of light as far as I could see

00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:02,370
there were stars

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,590
some of them clustered so tightly

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:09,980
together they made swirling patterns of

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:09,980
white against the inky darkness I stared

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,419
I've had people describing the stars to

00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:17,399
me all my life and what I've come to

00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,679
realize was that everyone tells you

00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,960
something different because they all see

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,820
them in their own way

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,100
but none of what they had tried to

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,360
describe to me could possibly match the

00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,770
glittering arch of that night sky I

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,350
still wasn't seeing what others would

00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:36,179
have even with the assistance of night

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:39,899
vision goggles there would be stars to

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:41,909
them for my eyes to perceive Hindu there

00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:43,169
was the matter of that gleam wash of

00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:48,090
color over everything

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:49,770
it didn't matter I was breathless under

00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,990
an arm of the Milky Way that I'd always

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,750
simply had to take on faith was even

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,580
there

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:59,909
my dad had done what all good fathers

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,840
promised their children they'll do he

00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:02,840
gave me the stars

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,840
[Music]

00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:16,360
Thanks thank you

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,940
thanks pretty much so okay so community

00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:26,610
fair compensation collaboration those

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:30,690
three principles they become central to

00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:32,669
how we make things on hit record and

00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,080
those things that we make on hit record

00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:36,450
as you can see it's things like that

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,480
that no isolated individual could have

00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:42,149
really made something quite like that

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,070
and that's the kind of creativity that I

00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:46,080
think the Internet has the potential to

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:49,220
facilitate and really what's going on in

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,799
this room today is the the best proof

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,960
but when I say creativity I don't only

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,250
mean making art you guys know about how

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,940
it can work in the generation of

00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,830
software I wonder if it could you know

00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,649
these same principles might might be

00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:09,389
applied in in other areas in other

00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:11,639
fields for example you know like perhaps

00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:12,960
in the field of journalism right so

00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:16,110
there's so many people out there who

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,549
blog about the news independently and

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,789
sometimes it can feel like people are

00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:22,110
just shouting in an echo chamber but

00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:24,809
what if they could form productive

00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,700
communities that that collaborated on

00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:31,110
larger feats of a substantial

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,700
investigative journalism or like a lot

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:36,630
of experts agree that that our methods

00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,490
of Education really need reinvention so

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:40,080
what if rather than competing against

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,299
your classmates because the class is

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,309
being graded on a curve what if students

00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,809
worked on collaborative projects where

00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:47,460
they all pulled together as a team and

00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:48,870
then what if your team was not bound by

00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,639
the walls of your classroom but you know

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:52,649
also included online community of kids

00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:53,850
from around the world I'm sure you guys

00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:56,490
have thought of this because this is the

00:32:53,850 --> 00:33:00,929
kind of thing you guys do and couldn't

00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:03,630
school work that way then of course

00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:05,940
there's government right which is an

00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:09,419
area that we're all probably thinking

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,789
about a lot these days and I think

00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:14,610
obviously the internet could and should

00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:16,889
be able to help modernize the people's

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:20,010
ability to be truly represented by our

00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:21,690
democracy and perhaps a similar process

00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,549
to the one we use create art or the one

00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:27,270
you guys use to create software could be

00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:28,770
used to create policy but if that's

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,000
going to work our online culture is

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:34,169
really gonna have to grow up

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,779
I think the one thing that you can say

00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:39,299
for sure is that as we move forward into

00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:42,120
the future the internet will definitely

00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:44,519
impact every industry more and more and

00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,450
the question is what kind of impact will

00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,610
that be but if people all around the

00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:53,190
world can come together do more than

00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:55,470
just connect and socialize but if we can

00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,909
actually collaborate to create things

00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,970
that that we wouldn't have been able to

00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:02,789
make without each other

00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:05,720
when I picture that future I start to

00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:09,500
feel optimistic about the future because

00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,300
it's it's not just the capabilities of

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:16,099
Technology it's it's what the technology

00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:24,599
can make us capable of as human beings

00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:27,750
thanks very much awesome really good

00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,669
really good you know

00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,220
we've been talking about you know this

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:35,649
kind of intersection of culture and code

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,200
and I think one of the things that these

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,819
folks know is that the code that they've

00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,470
created that runs most of society these

00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:43,839
days has a lot of power and

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:46,089
responsibility with it you know we

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,059
talked about keeping in touch and you

00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:51,460
know if you can help us understand how

00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:54,730
culture how the kind of you know emotion

00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:57,220
invoking works that you're creating can

00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,589
be assisted by the code and the power of

00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,210
this room yeah we would be super happy I
