pleasure to be here today so we're gonna

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:09,210
switch to the front end here and try and

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:12,660
analyze what is it about these products

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,030
about these companies that over the past

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,810
few years maybe the past five to ten

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,150
years start it out as toys started out

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,140
as nice-to-haves

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,830
started out as these products that

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,140
everyone dismissed at first and yet

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,730
within the span of a few short years are

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,610
touching the lives of hundreds of

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,160
millions of users if not billions of

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,680
users and making hundreds of millions if

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,820
not billions of dollars so who am I

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,309
talking about here I'm talking about

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,309
Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,399
whatsapp and on the in the not just on

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,039
the consumer web but in the enterprise

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,050
companies like slack right what is it

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,430
about the design of these products and

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,670
services what is it about the user

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,550
experience that makes them so

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,559
habit-forming well that's been the core

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,910
of my study for the past several years I

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,500
wrote a book called hooked how to build

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,510
habit-forming products it's on Amazon

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,610
for 14 bucks if you don't have 14 bucks

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,840
no problem you guys know where to pirate

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,040
this kind of stuff just go get it

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,409
somewhere I don't care if you pay for it

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,170
or not we're gonna do a kind of a brief

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,860
overview today of how these products

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,479
form habits in their users so that we're

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,259
all in the same page let's make sure we

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,170
define habits as a behavior done with

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,970
little or no conscious thought now this

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,240
is about half of what you do every

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,490
single day is done purely out of habit

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,829
these behaviors done with little or no

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,170
conscious thought and I believe that we

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,320
are on the precipice of an age where we

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,299
can use these habits for good well we

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,540
can help people live happier healthier

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,560
more productive more connected lives by

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,170
designing these habits turns out that

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,670
what is at the core of every single one

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,049
of these companies that I just mentioned

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,189
what is at the core of their user

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,049
experience is what's called a hook a

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,630
hook is an experience designed to

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,239
connect the users problem with your

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,690
product with your solution with enough

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,350
frequency to form a habit connecting the

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,850
users

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,880
with your product with enough frequency

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,860
to form a habit now it's through

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,680
successive cycles through these hooks

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,170
that our preferences are shaped that our

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,450
tastes are formed and that our habits

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,000
take hold so we're gonna spend a few

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,480
minutes and analyze how you build these

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,050
hooks into your user experience hooks

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,480
have four parts a trigger an action a

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,770
reward and finally an investment so

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,650
we're gonna walk through these four

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,960
basic steps the first step of every hook

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,820
is a trigger and there are two types of

00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,460
trigger the first type of trigger you'll

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,410
be very familiar with these are called

00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,170
external triggers external triggers are

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,260
things that tell the user what to do

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,620
next with some piece of information okay

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,750
designers product developers PMS we know

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,150
all about these external triggers as our

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,280
craft as what we do for a living we make

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,110
these buttons that say click here and

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,080
buy now and play this these are all

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,490
examples of external triggers we know

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,060
all about these right we see them every

00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,400
day as users of these products but what

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,770
we don't think about enough and what

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
turns out to be absolutely critical in

00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,640
forming these long-term habits is

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,660
creating an association with what's

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,840
called an internal trigger an internal

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,060
trigger prompts the user to action tells

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,820
us what to do next but the information

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:43,980
is not in the trigger itself the

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:46,470
information is in the user's brain so

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,700
what we do in response to being in a

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,710
certain place a certain situation

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,080
partaking in a certain routine around

00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,740
certain people and most frequently when

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,710
we experience certain emotions tells us

00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,840
what to do next now the most frequently

00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,690
occurring internal trigger are these

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,320
emotions but not just any emotion they

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,930
are specifically negative emotions

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,460
negative emotions so what we do when

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,560
we're feeling bored or lost or

00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,000
indecisive or lonely or fearful what we

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,950
do when we experience these negative

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,350
emotions prompts us to turn to our

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,960
devices with little or no conscious

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,400
thought now there's a lot of studies

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,870
that show this one of my favorites was a

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,710
study a few years ago that found that

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,430
people suffering from depression

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:33,490
check email more I just saw three or

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,319
four people put away their phones what

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,490
happened there why did this study

00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,960
conclude this what did this study found

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,180
this study found that people suffering

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,400
from clinical depression experience what

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,970
psychologists call negative valence

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,250
states they felt down more frequently

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,620
than the general population what were

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,090
they doing when they felt those negative

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,740
emotions when they felt those negative

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,000
valence states they were turning to

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,150
their devices they were going online

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,669
they were checking email more often than

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,620
the rest of the population but of course

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,000
we all do this right you don't have to

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,669
be clinically depressed there is only

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,250
one reason and one reason alone that

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,979
people use any product or service you

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,310
know what that one reason is to modulate

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:18,699
their mood to make them feel something

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,919
different let me ask you what website or

00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:23,340
app do you check when you're feeling

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,440
lonely where do you go

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,680
Facebook right this guy said tinder also

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,680
true

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,450
where do we go where do we go when we're

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,040
feeling uncertain when we're looking for

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,300
the answer for something before we ask

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,310
our brain if we know the answer what are

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,960
we doing the Google is right

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,490
and what about we're feeling bored you

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,810
know between 2 & 4 o'clock in the

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,950
afternoon you have that big barrage is

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,170
you don't feel like working on right now

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,700
where do you go you go to Reddit you

00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,470
check New York Times you check stock

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,120
prices you look at sports scores you

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,710
look at YouTube you check out what's

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,080
happening in the news all of these

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,020
products and services are triggered they

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,240
cater to this uncomfortable feeling of

00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,100
boredom and we before our brain

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,200
understands why we are on these sites

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,630
why we are checking with these apps or

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,190
already on them so if you are building

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,840
the kind of product or service that you

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,250
want to turn into a habit that you want

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,380
people to turn to with little or no

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,600
conscious thought you have to be able to

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,780
articulate what is that frequently

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,060
occurring itch that prompts the user to

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,070
find relief with your product or service

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,500
that's what the internal trigger that's

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,990
what the trigger phase is all about

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,030
after we've defined our triggers the

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,500
next step of the hook is the action

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:39,430
phase the action phase is defined as the

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:42,100
simplest behavior done anticipation in

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,990
anticipation of a reward the simplest

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,570
behavior the user can do to get some

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,730
kind of relief from that itch from that

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:52,060
psychological pain they experienced in

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,430
that internal trigger phase now this is

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,670
something as simple as scrolling on

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,890
Pinterest or a quick search on Google or

00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,960
simply what could be easier than pushing

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,790
the play button on YouTube these

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,270
incredibly simple behaviors done

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,740
anticipation of an immediate reward

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,720
turns out there's actually a formula to

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,130
help us predict the likelihood of these

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,690
singular behavior that comes to us from

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,450
a psychologist at Stanford by the name

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:20,080
of BJ Fogg and Fogg tells us that for

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:23,020
any human behavior be any human behavior

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,720
be we need three things to occur we need

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,680
the user to have sufficient motivation

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,200
we need the user to have sufficient

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,990
ability ability is how easy or difficult

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,370
to behavior is to do and the trigger

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,110
must be present we just talked all about

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,230
triggers let's talk about motivation and

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,180
ability motivation is the energy for

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,039
action how much I want to do a

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,990
particular behavior okay

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,969
now when it comes to user motivation

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,400
there's only six factors that we can use

00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:50,379
to increase user motivation because all

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,289
of us as human beings we seek pleasure

00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:55,479
we avoid pain we seek hope we avoid fear

00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,669
we seek social acceptance and we avoid

00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,490
social rejection so there's only six

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,800
ways to manipulate user motivation all

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,569
of us have these same core six drivers

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,369
of motivation now let's talk about

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:11,409
ability ability is the capacity to do a

00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:13,479
particular behavior how easy or

00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,249
difficult something is to do and here

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,339
again we have a few levers that we can

00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:22,569
pull on that make a behavior more likely

00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:24,909
to occur by making it easier to do okay

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,919
that is a cardinal rule of user design

00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,199
of user experience design the easier

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,409
something is to do the more likely

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,289
people are to do it so if you reduce the

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,360
amount of time money physical effort

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:39,069
cognitive load this is a big one when it

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,469
comes to tech products the heart or

00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:44,380
something is to understand that less

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,420
likely you are to do it social deviants

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,130
non-routine all of these factors of

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,889
ability all of these things that make

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,889
something hard to do make it less likely

00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:55,779
that the user will do it so we can

00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:58,420
actually plot these three things on a

00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:00,670
graph on a conceptual graph and ask

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,810
ourselves if the user isn't doing the

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,279
thing you want them to do they're not

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,440
clicking they're not progressing they're

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,660
not buying any singular human behavior

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,209
we can put on this graph and we can ask

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,339
ourselves does the user have sufficient

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:14,589
motivation on the y-axis high motivation

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,839
low motivation does the user have

00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:18,490
sufficient ability if something is easy

00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,339
to do it's on the far right on the

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,980
x-axis if something is hard to do it's

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,990
on the left and when the user has

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,139
sufficient motivation and sufficient

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,180
ability if the trigger is present the

00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:33,490
behavior will occur every single time

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,319
they cross that red threshold and if the

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,540
trigger is there the behavior will occur

00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:40,930
let me demonstrate here think of the

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:43,600
last time that a phone rang okay phone

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,190
rings in your life phone rang and you

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,010
did not pick up the phone give me a

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,170
reason why didn't you pick up the phone

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,730
that's not a reason you didn't know the

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,930
number okay so somebody said like a

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,050
telemarketer you didn't know the number

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,490
right so you look at the phone so

00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,040
right there in front of you high ability

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,060
right way over on the right very easy to

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,800
do the phone was right there in front of

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,750
you you heard it ring but you lacked

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,360
motivation somebody you didn't want to

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,640
talk to what's another reason why you

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,860
may not pick up the call what's not the

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,110
reason so somebody said you're in the

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,399
middle of my talk exactly right so let's

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,260
say you're in the middle of my talk the

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,790
phone rings you hear it ring the trigger

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,890
was present okay

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,470
you somebody you wanted to talk to high

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,670
motivation but you lack ability you

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,959
don't want to be that one person in the

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,130
middle of the aisle that crossed there's

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,760
all I got to take this call right now

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,940
sorry that's difficult to do it's hard

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,490
right

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,820
so you lack ability you're way over here

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,019
on the left even with high motivation by

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,440
the way when people use our tech

00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,790
products and they want to use them but

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,850
they don't because they're too difficult

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,200
that's in that top left right high

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,430
motivation low ability you know what

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,470
that is called that little circle there

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,260
between the red line and the black line

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,779
that's called frustration right high

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,360
motivation low ability so the best thing

00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:00,149
we can do to make a behavior more likely

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,860
to occur is not start with motivation

00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:03,630
many people think particular when it

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,120
comes to enterprise products that if we

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,040
just talk to the user if we convince the

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,709
user if we show them more testimonials

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,910
and videos then will boost motivation

00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,920
they'll do the thing we designed for

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,050
them to do but that's not the first

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,360
place to start the first place to always

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,190
start is to make sure a clear trigger is

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,860
present I can't tell you how many times

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,940
I work with my clients and I say where's

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,940
the trigger what do you want me to do

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,079
here or remove the cognitive clutter

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,060
this happens a lot of times when

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,520
engineers design products folks there

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,920
are six million things you could do but

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,140
no clear call to action I see this every

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,490
single day the easiest thing you can do

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,649
if you want to get a behavior to occur

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:45,660
more frequently is to make that behavior

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:47,100
easier increase user ability okay the

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,440
next step of the hook is the reward

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,010
phase of the hook this is where the user

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,100
gets what they came for now when we talk

00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,980
about rewards we have to talk about the

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,589
brain and in particular an area of the

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,510
brain that we know today as the nucleus

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,940
accumbens now the nucleus accumbens was

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,350
first studied by two Canadian

00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,940
researchers by the name of olds and

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,650
Milner back in the 1940s

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,270
and old and Miller did some very

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,910
interesting experiments they took

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:17,190
electrodes and they inserted these

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,710
electrodes inside the brains of lab

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,560
animals and they connected those those

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:25,140
electrodes to a little lever that the

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,030
lab animals could push on and every time

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,950
the lab animal pushed on this lever they

00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:32,400
would receive an electrical jolt to

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,950
their nucleus accumbens what olds and

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,010
Milner discovered was that these lab

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,320
animals wanted nothing but stimulating

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,300
their nucleus accumbens they would

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,790
forego food and water they would run

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,170
across painful electrified grids just to

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,600
continue to activate this part of the

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,610
brain in later experiments done on

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,780
people they observe similar results that

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,610
when people were given these little

00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,630
buttons to press on and every time they

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,160
pressed on these buttons they would

00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,470
receive an electrical jolt to their

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,090
nucleus accumbens they did so hundreds

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,260
of times some of the people in the

00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,140
studies had to have the machines

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,030
forcibly removed from them to get them

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,070
to stop pressing on these buttons now

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,480
turns out we don't eat electrodes in

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,090
people's brains to get people to push

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,250
buttons today today you know where I'm

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:16,980
going with this all sorts of things

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:20,100
activate the nucleus accumbens junk food

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,280
sex luxury goods and of course these

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,020
devices all of these things activate the

00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,230
very same part of the brain the nucleus

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,910
accumbens now for decades the psychology

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,280
community believed that the purpose of

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,660
the nucleus accumbens was to stimulate

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,400
pleasure right

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,620
why else would lab animals and later

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,210
people incessantly activate this part of

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,020
the brain if it wasn't because it felt

00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:45,480
good right not exactly what we now know

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:50,400
is that the nucleus accumbens becomes

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,890
most active in anticipation of the

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,880
reward but when we actually get the

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,590
thing we want the thing that's gonna

00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,600
make us feel good and finally make us

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:02,340
happy that's when the nucleus accumbens

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:05,370
becomes less active so the way the brain

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,910
gets us to act is not by stimulating

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:13,350
pleasure it's by stimulating this itch

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:17,550
that we seek to scratch and it turns out

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:21,330
folks that there is a way to supercharge

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,800
this desirous response did you know that

00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,790
there is a way

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,830
to manufacture desire and I can tell you

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:42,870
how to do it does anybody here want to

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:46,709
know how to manufacture desire I'm doing

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:49,500
it to you right now so when I took that

00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,430
ten-second pause and I stopped talking

00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,980
for a second

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,839
some of you perked up why isn't he

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,980
talking anymore what's going on did he

00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,279
forget what he was going to say what's

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,850
gonna happen next and it turns out that

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,120
the unknown is fascinating

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:09,420
a bit of uncertainty a bit of mystery

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,899
causes us to engage causes us to focus

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,700
and it is highly habit-forming this

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,740
comes from the work of BF Skinner back

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,209
in the 1940s and 50s Skinner took his

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,670
little pigeons he put them in a little

00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,529
box and it gave him a disc to peck at

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,089
and every time the pigeon pecked at the

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,459
disc they would receive a reward a

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,320
little food pellet so very quickly

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,120
Skinner could train his pigeons to peck

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,860
at the disc receive a reward this is

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,950
called operant conditioning right

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,240
terrific worth great but then Skinner

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,640
wanted to see what would happen if he

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,290
gave these food pellets every once in a

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,010
while so sometimes the pigeon would peck

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,209
at the disc no food pellet no reward the

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,740
next time the pigeon would peck at the

00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:49,260
disc they would receive a reward and

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,060
what Skinner observed was that the rate

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,670
of response the number of times that

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:56,089
these pigeons pecked at the disc

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:59,630
increased when the reward was given on a

00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:02,279
variable schedule of reinforcement and

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,450
so when we look at the world around us

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,899
and we think about the things that are

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,760
most engaging most habit-forming the

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,149
things that capture your attention it

00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,630
won't let go you will find one or more

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:18,120
of these three types of variable rewards

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,699
what I call rewards of the tribe rewards

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,959
of the hunt and rewards of the self let

00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:24,990
me show you some examples let's start

00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:26,730
first with rewards of the tribe rewards

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,220
of the tribe are things that feel good

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,040
that have this element of variability

00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,410
and come from other people best example

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,120
online is of course social media when

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,200
you open up Facebook

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,690
you're never quite sure what you're

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,790
going to see what do people post one of

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,950
the comments going to say how many likes

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,750
does something get high degree of

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,950
variability when we use a site like

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,420
Facebook by the way we see the same

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,430
exact thing on Stack Overflow with all

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,620
those up votes same exact phenomenon

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,260
going on the next type of variable

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,450
reward is what we call rewards of the

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,100
hunt rewards of the hunt are about the

00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,300
search for material possessions and we

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,850
buy these material possessions with

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,449
money and today also that information is

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,579
used to get money and material rewards

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,020
when many people think of variable

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,000
rewards I think about slot machines

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,179
right to think about Las Vegas casinos

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,220
where the uncertainty involves what we

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,980
might win when we play one of these

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,839
games a chance right well I'm here to

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,850
tell you that the exact same psychology

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,819
at work on these slot machines is at

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:30,000
work online consider for a moment the

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:32,250
feed have we all noticed how prevalent

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,910
the feed is today every product today

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:39,000
somehow has this feed mechanic LinkedIn

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,790
Facebook Twitter Instagram slack all

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,720
everything today is a feed why is that

00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,890
well let's take a look at Twitter just

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,420
as an example which but you could

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,450
substitute on any number of different

00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,800
apps here if I look at that first tweet

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,940
yeah that's not that interesting maybe

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,290
the second tweet that's not actually

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,850
maybe the third or fourth tweet is

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,340
interesting though so what do I have to

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:59,910
do to get see more interesting content

00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,710
what do I have to do scroll all I got to

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,320
do is scroll and that's scrolling and

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,740
scrolling use the exact same psychology

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,840
as pulling on a slot machine both

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,250
variable rewards of the hunt at work

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,350
searching and searching and never done

00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,340
searching for that next variable reward

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,429
that next interesting piece of

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,440
information the third type of variable

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,940
reward is what I call rewards of the

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,400
self rewards of the self are things that

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,860
feel good that have this element of

00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,020
variability but aren't about these these

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,820
these they don't involve other people

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,470
and aren't about these material or

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,510
information rewards these are things

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,179
that are intrinsically pleasurable they

00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,610
they feel good in and of themselves it's

00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:41,580
about the search for mastery consistency

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,850
competency and control best example

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:48,210
online is game play right so when people

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:50,370
play clash of clans or Angry Birds or

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,550
any of these other online games they're

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,080
not

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,060
necessarily playing them with other

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,860
people they're not really winning

00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,840
anything in terms of any kind of

00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,520
material goods but there's something fun

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,510
about getting to the next level the next

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,940
accomplishment

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,380
the next achievement and I know many of

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,050
us here were very serious business

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,760
people we don't play these online games

00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:11,720
but I bet you you play this game every

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,950
day just look familiar

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,900
getting to that unread message in your

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,980
inbox finishing the two do's on your

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,390
to-do list and the thing that always

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,950
gets me is clearing that one

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,770
notification on my home screen so I can

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,930
open it and clear it away those are all

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,820
examples of rewards of the hunt the

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:30,120
search for mastery consistency

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,710
competency and control finally the

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,450
fourth step of the hook is the

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,910
investment phase this is probably the

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,400
most overlooked of the four steps of the

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,830
hook the investment phase is where the

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,350
user puts something into the product

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,970
that makes it better and better with use

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,910
and this is what is so magical and

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,010
different about tech products versus

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,780
physical goods right physical goods

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,210
things made out of atoms as opposed to

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,520
things made out of bits they depreciate

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,530
with wear and tear my clothing these

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,050
chairs that everything in the material

00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,500
world loses value with wear and tear

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,200
right

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,910
but habit-forming technology should do

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,190
the opposite habit-forming products

00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,290
should appreciate with use they should

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,560
get better and better the more we use

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:16,500
them right that's amazing so based on

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,360
how much content we give to a site how

00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,600
much data we given to them how many

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,460
followers follow us how much our

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,070
reputation increases on a site all of

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,870
these things make the product better and

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,720
better and better with use that

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,780
investment phase is critical to forming

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,720
these long term habit forming products

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,310
now as you notice through these

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
investments the products become a little

00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,570
bit stickier they become a little bit

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,710
harder to to stop using in fact even if

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:48,950
a better product or service comes along

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:52,290
which brings me to this cold hard fact

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,060
you are not going to like there is a

00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,100
myth that's been perpetuating our

00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,570
industry there all we need to do is to

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,230
have the best technology because the

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:03,840
best technology will win that's a lie

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,880
it's not the best product that wins its

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,770
a product that captures the monopoly of

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,830
the mind the product that we turn to

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:12,570
first that's the product that captures

00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,610
the market because it's through

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,830
successive cycles through these hooks a

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,110
trigger action reward investment this is

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,000
how product preferences are shaped how

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,559
our tastes are formed and how these

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,450
habits take hold

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,039
now many folks when I tell them about

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,049
this hook model and how it's built into

00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,850
many of the world's most habit-forming

00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,200
products and services like Facebook and

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,630
Twitter and Instagram and whatsapp and

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,850
slack and snapchat the reaction is like

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,440
oh that's kind of mind control I'm not

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,659
sure is this ethical is this okay to do

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,179
to people and I think that's missing the

00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,490
point because that's not my audience

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,110
right the gaming companies and the

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,720
social media companies they already know

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,750
all this that's who I studied to be here

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,360
with you today I'm here to help all

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,640
sorts of other products be more

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,850
habit-forming because let's face it most

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,559
technology out there it doesn't suck us

00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,330
in the way Facebook and Instagram and

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:08,880
whatsapp and snapchat dude no no it

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:10,590
doesn't suck us in it just sucks so my

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,090
incentive the reason I'm here with you

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,700
today the reason I study habit-forming

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,380
technology is because I believe that we

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,380
can build a world where technology

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:22,200
products help people do things they want

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,140
to do but for lack of good product

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,490
design don't do and to show you I put my

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,559
money where my mouth is let me give you

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:32,010
one quick example before I go this is a

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,140
company called seven cups the founder is

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,640
a guy by the name of Glenn Moriarty he's

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,649
a psychotherapist out of Virginia Beach

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,539
he called me up a few years ago after he

00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,980
read my book and he said look near I got

00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,750
this idea for an app I want to share

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,520
with you here's my hook as a

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,080
psychotherapist I know lots of folks

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,140
don't come get the service they need

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,450
right a parent of a child with the

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,820
disability a soldier suffering from PTSD

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,710
they don't go get therapy because it's

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,750
hard it's expensive there's social

00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,549
stigma around it so here's the app I'm

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,159
going to build here's my hook the

00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:04,140
internal trigger is seeking connection

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,020
its loneliness it's when someone needs

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,140
to connect with another human being the

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:12,330
action phase of the hook is to just open

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,490
the app doesn't cost a dime you push one

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,110
button and you're instantly connected to

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,790
another person that's ready to listen

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,890
that's the variable

00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,780
rewards of the tribe this this

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,900
communication that you get this variable

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,790
reward from Anu another human being and

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,580
finally the investment phase the more

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,140
you interact with seven cups hook the

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,450
more you begin to be offered this

00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,360
opportunity to learn how to be a trained

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,940
listener yourself and it turns out that

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,680
people who use this product have found

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,140
it to be as effective according to a

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,930
third party study as traditional

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,090
psychotherapy this one app conducts a

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:51,210
hundred and eighty thousand sessions

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:54,480
every single week talk about the amazing

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,700
power of habit-forming technologies so

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,560
with that I encourage you to build the

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,510
change you want to see in the world to

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,760
find one of the world's problems to fix

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,980
because I truly do believe that using

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,860
the power of habit forming technology we

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:16,470
can help use habits for good thank you

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:17,730
very much one more quick thing if you I

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,230
saw lots of people taking pictures of

in an enterprise company and you say oh

these are lots of consumer web examples

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,280
look for the presentation that says

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,840
hooked in the enterprise all kinds of

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,090
enterprise examples in that presentation

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,060
and one more announcement tomorrow

00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:00,420
evening at 6 p.m. I will be giving a

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,740
three-hour workshop on this material for

00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,000
a small group of folks there are still a

00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,920
few tickets available we're gonna be

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,900
doing it at the at the hotel at the

00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,970
Marriott and those tickets are available

00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,800
at that URL and with that thank you so

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,260
much all right I have one quick question

00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,360
before you go you know and I think you

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,620
already answered it I know what some of

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,590
these folks are thinking wow the

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,780
consumer thing and then your definition

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,810
of enterprise might be a CRM application

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:27,450
their definition of enterprise is in

00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:28,800
underlying infrastructure software right

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,500
you know cloud management

00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,030
so it's really about frequency that's

00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,590
the critical question it's not industry

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,720
sector it's not consumer web or

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,280
enterprise it's frequency if you're if

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,860
you're building the kind of product that

00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,630
is is kind of bought and then tucked

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,580
away somewhere and never used again like

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,020
insurance for example insurance car

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,910
insurance does not need to be a habit

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,370
right Geico is never gonna become a

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,500
habit right of course the problem with

00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,060
those type of products is that it's very

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,530
easy you know Geico comes in and says

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,760
we're gonna save you 15% on car

00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,960
insurance it's very easy for the next

00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,670
person to come in and say oh yeah we're

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,410
gonna save you 20% on car insurance and

00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,570
they take you away right so it's not

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,190
that non-habit-forming products are bad

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,050
businesses they're perfectly fine

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,040
businesses it's just if they operate in

00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,590
a different way whereas these

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,320
habit-forming products build in customer

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,270
loyalty and retention in a way that

00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,100
doesn't require them to spend a ton of

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,450
money on constantly advertising and

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,610
spamming people people are using these

00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,470
products on their own so to qualify and

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,150
see if you even need to form a habit the

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,280
first question is is your product you

00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:30,000
used with sufficient frequency got it

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,860
great tip thank you get the book we can

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,870
always improve the habit-forming nature

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,290
of open source software thank you very

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:40,450
much

00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:40,450
