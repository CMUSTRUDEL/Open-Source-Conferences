About Linus Torvalds
Linus was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He enrolled at the University of Helsinki in 1988, graduating with a master's degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis was titled “Linux: A Portable Operating System” and was the genesis for what would become the most important collaborative software project in history.In August 1991, Linus announced that he was developing the Linux kernel, proclaiming, “it won’t be big and professional.” Never in the history of technology has someone been so wrong. In spite of his humble proclamation, Linux has become the world’s most pervasive operating system. Today the Linux kernel forms the basis of the Linux operating system and powers billions of Android devices, powers ChromeOS, and has permeated almost every industry and form factor. Smartphones, TVs, appliances, cars, nuclear submarines, air traffic control, stock exchanges, and scientific research all run Linux. Linux also provides the underpinnings of the internet and the cloud computing industry.In 2005, citing a lack of free and open source version control tools that met his needs for performance and scale, Linus famously created Git in only 10 days. Today Git is widely used in software development and for other version-control tasks such as configuration management, and has become popular as an integral part of the DevOps culture.In 2000, Linus was listed by Time Magazine as Number 17 in the Time 100: Most Important People of the Century. Again, in 2004, Time Magazine named him one of the Most Influential People in the world. He was honored in 2008 with the Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland, “in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel.” He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award. A true tech titan, he was admitted to the Computer History Museum Hall of Fellows, joining the ranks of the tech elite including Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, Tim Berners-Lee, Gordon Moore, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Steve Wozniak, and others.Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.

let me welcome we do store Vols the

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:13,759
creator Linux and get welcome welcome

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,369
welcome have a seat

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,010
welcome old-timer well I mean this day

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,859
has started off well first you said that

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:30,869
we have an insane speaker lineup and I

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:34,110
was like oh you know well you know

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,210
what's what's old is new again and you

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,040
know we won't talk about I know you and

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,329
I are very very as you know very close

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,160
in age but I want to start by you know

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,730
you've been doing this rule - what 26

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,289
years now 26 years we're releasing the

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,230
Linux kernel every three months or so

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,530
now out of your house in Portland yes

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,079
and you know let me just Time magazine

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,510
called you the 17th most important

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,890
person of the century I'm working on

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,110
that there you go

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,180
Business Week described you as the Henry

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,070
Ford of the Information Age you're in

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,799
the internet Hall of Fame you won the

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,030
Millennium technology prize which

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,290
essentially a Nobel Prize of computer

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,299
science have you ever thought about the

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,770
fact that even though you're may be

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,430
yesterday's news you're an important

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:29,189
person in the world I don't really

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,530
because to be honest well I do and I

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,439
don't so the part that I really am happy

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,939
about is the fact that I know I do

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,170
something meaningful and I think

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,900
everybody wants to do that right

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,140
everybody wants to feel like what they

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,930
do matters you don't want to just have a

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,409
job you want to do something that that

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,850
has an impact right regardless of what

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,610
you're into whether you're into

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,450
technology or anything else and and

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,759
that's part of what really makes me

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,380
happy to still do not quite the same

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,009
thing but still work on the same project

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,590
26 years later is that I feel like it's

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,729
meaningful yeah at the same time

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,030
I literally work

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:16,870
from my home office in my bathrobe I

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,030
mean it is not a glamorous life I've

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,430
long since gotten over the fact that

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,310
okay the UPS guy comes and brings me a

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,840
package from Amazon at 3 p.m. and I'm

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,920
still in my bathrobe

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,430
whoa I'm just saying I know I think we

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,590
had a shower before new policy at the

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:41,680
Linux Foundation what that's why I don't

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:43,599
go to the office and okay well you you

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,269
know you wrote an entire book on this

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,310
concept of having impact but then

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,930
working for fun right you know that

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,120
you've said over and over again that's

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,430
the reason you got into Linux that's why

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,650
you continue to work on Linux but you

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,870
know you heard your scene saying you

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,440
know we need we need to pay developers I

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,790
agree with her to get them in ninety

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,690
percent of their one more I think of the

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,549
people work on Linux are all

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,640
professional developers full-time on

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,760
that is it does that make it less fun

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,049
more fun like is this sort of

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,669
professionalization of open-source good

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:19,180
bad like what do you what do you think

00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:21,819
of and I so I don't know if anybody

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,130
actually read the book but the premise

00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:27,209
of the book was that you kind of move on

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:32,040
to fun that you have to start with the

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:34,450
survival and if you don't have survival

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,099
you're not going to care about having

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,620
fun right that's that's kind of the

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:41,620
basis and you're moving on to the point

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,060
where once you guaranteed survival once

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,950
you've guaranteed that you have this

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,209
social connection to the world around

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,280
you you want to get to the point where

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:54,129
where the most motivating thing in your

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,069
life is fun I mean it's different fun

00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:59,290
for different people you for me it's the

00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,389
fun of a technical challenge right that

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,220
to me is fun it's not fun for everybody

00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:07,329
hopefully it is fun for most people in

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,049
this audience right and one of the

00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:13,030
things I'm a big believer on in is not

00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:16,000
in order to have fun you really don't

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:19,690
need want to worry about the whole daily

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,820
survival thing and admittedly that was

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,720
easier I think in Finland where I grew

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,760
where education is free so me taking

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,880
basically eight years to get a masters

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,700
degree and doing Linux for fun on the

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,410
side was a lot easier than it would be

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:41,140
here in the US right but to get to your

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:45,550
actual question the whole fact that you

00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:48,400
are employable in technology today if so

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,370
it allows you to then do fun projects

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,290
because you know you know you can find a

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,260
job which is not necessarily true in

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,870
many other areas and that allows you to

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:03,670
do experimentation and work on projects

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,920
that you might not otherwise be from the

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,020
free to work on yeah and and I think

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,880
it's very important to have companies

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,290
involved in open-source and it's

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,480
actually one of the things I've been

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:19,390
happiest about in the whole Linux

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:23,050
community was how to some degree Linux

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:26,650
came out of the free software movement

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:30,250
and there was a lot of anti-commercial

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,520
and there still to some degree is people

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:36,490
who kind of do it because they hate

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,500
companies and I always felt that no

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,480
that's not how you're supposed to work

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,550
guy I think you're supposed to do it

00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,620
because he enjoy your work but you

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,360
should not hate those companies that can

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,780
actually help make your project better

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,060
can bring you all those users because

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,790
users to any project are what really

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,450
matter and meanly you can get users

00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,310
other ways to do but but at the end of

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,460
the day a lot of the people you want to

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,430
reach need to have support need to have

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,790
all that nights those nights finishing

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,620
touches the QA the documentation the

00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,930
things that a lot of technical people

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,810
certainly mean may not be that

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,820
interested in yeah so I think we've

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,290
succeeded in the the kernel community in

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,890
particular very well with this

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,990
realization that it's not about the

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,390
small guy against the companies it

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,310
really is about collaboration and its

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,620
collaboration whether you're a small

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,230
individual contributor or whether you're

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,300
a company or whether you're University

00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,680
or anything in between yeah I mean it

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,850
creates this positive feedback loop

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,380
right you have to you have to

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,200
acknowledge both I think the the

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,090
interesting thing is you know the

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,650
combination of the intrinsic motivation

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,440
I think Harvard Karim Lakhani at Harvard

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,720
did a great study on this where peer

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,240
review that they're mastering of your

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,910
craft the joy of solving big technical

00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,650
problems combined by the ability for

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,750
companies debt to your point a lot of

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,960
people describe by paying them creates

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,930
this massive feedback loop that that

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,460
Linux certainly benefits from yeah what

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,010
I want to ask on that point

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,560
so you know I often describe myself as

00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,620
the janitor bubbly I want I wanna I want

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:23,590
you to to judge that's right it's kind

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:27,550
of you to I shower before noon okay but

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:30,000
you know one of one of our jobs is to be

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,460
the supporting cast to help open up

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,250
markets you know the auto sector we

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,750
talked about this last night at dinner

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,150
you know today we're seeing Linux and

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:44,260
production vehicles but we took seven

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,760
years to work with automotive OEMs there

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,490
are two one suppliers there then

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,080
subsequent downstream suppliers to teach

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,270
them how to participate in open source

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,370
to understand the licensing regimes to

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,470
allow their employees to jump in and

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,790
participate my question to you is you

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,190
know we're doing all that stuff in the

00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,870
background how does it impact you've

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,630
seen an impact is this you know really

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,150
hitting the kernel community do you see

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,770
better participation better support for

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,500
different hardware architectures and so

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:15,370
forth so one of the things I notice is

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,410
we're having a lot easier time working

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,090
with people who work at companies that

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,020
are not necessarily part of the

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:25,870
community it used to be a huge problem

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:30,460
with a lot of tech companies where we

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:34,060
had educated technical people who really

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:37,479
wanted to collaborate with us but their

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:41,229
companies would not allow them to work

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,960
on open-source projects and when they

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,420
did allow them it was all quite often

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,070
not always but most of the time it was

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,300
do not use the

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:57,310
an email address because companies used

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,830
to not they were worried about their

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,430
employees being associated with a

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,440
project that was not their project and

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:08,700
and I think it's not just Linux

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,330
Foundation but but this whole the last

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:16,150
couple of decades teaching companies

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,570
that you can actually be participating

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:22,990
in the process and teaching legal people

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:26,530
inside companies who are basically

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:30,070
taught from high school that their job

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:31,750
is to cover the company's ass teaching

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,110
those legal people that it's actually

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,200
okay to have developers be involved in

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,140
the process and actually put the company

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,060
name there so that outside developers

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,490
see that hey that company is actually

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,200
doing something good yeah it's a good

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,960
thing I think that's that's been one of

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,270
the things that have changed let's say I

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,400
I do want to I mean my reaction when you

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,440
said it took us seven years to work with

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,270
these auto manufacturers that's actually

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,670
a very common thing I've seen all over

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,220
is that people think that Linux

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:05,650
development is fast and I mean we saw

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,500
the numbers Linux development at some

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:12,520
level is very fast but at the same time

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,390
I know this over and over again that we

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,640
take forever to do one particular thing

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,920
can take years and years of effort and a

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,750
lot of people come into the project and

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,040
they think hey they've heard all that

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,080
hope it happens yesterday and I want to

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,450
point out there's a lot of things on the

00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:34,090
technical side to where it took us seven

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,250
years to get things working so quite

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,970
often you only see the end result when

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:42,220
it's done and then it looks like oh wow

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,950
yesterday didn't work now it works these

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,560
guys are good but that kind of ignores

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:50,020
the 70 years before that it took to get

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,780
something to that point where where it's

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,850
being used yeah let's let's talk about

00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:59,230
security a little bit you know I about

00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:02,170
this Equifax hack in in how it was a CV

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:06,430
in struts but it's not the only one we

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:08,860
saw heartbleed we've seen you know in

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:13,930
projects out there these CVS can cause

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:15,550
real havoc and you know in terms of

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,920
you're aware of the core infrastructure

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,720
initiative of the work we're doing there

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,470
what are your thoughts on how we can

00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,440
improve if if open source is the

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,990
wellspring from which downstream all

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,750
these products and services and so forth

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:35,290
are made and then the salmon swim back

00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,790
upstream to redeposit code I'm losing

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,100
the metaphor here but you know what I'm

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,899
talking yeah how do we improve that well

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,170
spring from a security perspective what

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:46,300
are your thoughts so I mean I'm I'm one

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,730
of those people who will tell everybody

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,180
that's the concept of absolute security

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:55,839
does not exist and even if we do a

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,470
perfect job which we try but let's be

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,050
honest

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,149
we'll always have bugs where we

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,790
overlooked some detail and a smart

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:05,790
person comes in and say hey that's a bug

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,890
that I can actually take advantage of

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:13,540
even if we we're to do a perfect job

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:15,699
there are all these projects that use

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,800
the kernel and then even if they do the

00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:20,050
perfect job somebody will deploy the end

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,720
result wrongly and it's not secured

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,360
despite all the work we did so there is

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,949
no such thing as perfect security or

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,990
absolute security but at the same time I

00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:35,740
think people have gotten so aware of

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:39,730
Asia and most of the projects I'm aware

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:42,399
of do we so I'll talk about the kernel

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:46,209
because that's what I obviously care

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,190
about the most we not only have all the

00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:50,260
infrastructure in place to do various

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:54,819
checking both statically and at runtime

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:57,790
but what I'm happiest about is I see all

00:12:54,819 --> 00:13:01,480
these tools to fuss inputs it turns out

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:04,389
random attacks is very powerful for

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,490
finding various bugs and some of those

00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,529
bugs are security when when you have

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,150
that infrastructure and I'm seeing a lot

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:19,390
of projects you studying for structure

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:22,840
it's getting to the point where you may

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:26,980
not reach absolute security but people

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:29,860
who deploy the defaults models today are

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,260
so much better off and they have so many

00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:37,000
layers of security then we're making

00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:40,720
obvious improvements and will we ever

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,230
get to a perfect world no but I'm not

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,590
actually worried as a as a technical

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,660
person I'm also always very impressed by

00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:54,250
some of the people who are attacking our

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:58,090
code and and you get kind of sometimes I

00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:02,380
get the feeling that that these smart

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:06,340
people are doing really bad things but I

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:08,440
wish they were on our side because they

00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,740
are so smart and they could help us and

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,010
that's where I actually want us to go

00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,960
where we try to get as many of those

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:20,710
smart people before they turn to that

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,930
dark side and an improved security that

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,640
way by having a culture and having a lot

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,060
of developers that care about security

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,300
and and encouraging the people who who

00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:37,240
are interested in security to come to us

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:41,380
instead of attacking us yeah in other

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:45,000
words get the pod Wan learners early so

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,000
that before they turned in the dark so

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,900
you know the Linux Foundation is

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,240
actually in the Lucas building so we

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,220
love Star Wars metaphors well you know

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,610
speaking speaking of young people you

00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,990
know one of the things that comes up all

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,820
the time is how do we get the next

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:08,140
generation of developers I mean you

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:10,720
heard steam as well into projects and I

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,340
do see young developers in a lot of

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:18,490
projects no no js' is a great example

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,270
but the kernel little excuse a little

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,030
bit older

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:24,910
all due respect how what's your

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:27,850
perception in terms of how young people

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,870
are coming in to the kernel are you

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:34,750
saying you think we're very good at that

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,310
we see a lot of the top level developers

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,810
have been around for a long time and

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,060
that does mean we're getting out or

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:43,150
we're getting fatter but at this we have

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:50,350
a ton of new people the kernel is kind

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:51,160
of still an odd you you know let me

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,770
start over

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,320
in order to get into the kernel you have

00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:59,320
to be interested in the kind of

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,040
low-level coding that a lot of people

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,380
just aren't interested in I don't think

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,980
the kernel will ever be something that

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,920
you would want to teach in a high school

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,800
class just because it is still esoteric

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,890
enough device drivers actually knowing

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,990
how a CPU work it's it's fairly esoteric

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,510
and you need a special kind of

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:25,330
dedication to really even bother to care

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:29,260
at the same time because it's so

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:33,010
esoteric the number of people who care

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:35,500
may be a small percentage but thanks to

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,930
the internet we can capture that and

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,790
because being open source means that

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,700
people can play with Linux in the way

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,790
they can't play with proprietary

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,620
projects we get I think a large

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:51,150
percentage of the people who are

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:55,390
interested in these kinds of low

00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,850
low-level problems and we have thousands

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:01,210
of people I mean new people every single

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:04,510
release right a lot of people will only

00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:07,600
do something small and maybe they notice

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,400
that it it was a bit too involved or

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,770
maybe they only had one small thing they

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:17,200
needed to fix but I actually from a

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,959
health perspective the kernel has more

00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,440
developers than just about any other

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,700
open-source project out there and so I'm

00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,490
not worried about that

00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:30,970
I'd actually I've seen other projects

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:33,040
that flounder to get new people and

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,230
flounder to get the kind of

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,650
share that people are aware of them to

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,000
come into that situation

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,410
yeah yeah certainly we need to help

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,800
those ones that they're important to

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:48,700
society you know speaking of young folks

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:52,840
getting involved in Linux I want to kind

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,810
of close here by talking about a letter

00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,480
we received back in 2014 so a few years

00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,090
ago almost four years ago now from a

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,530
sixth grader in Pennsylvania Zachary

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:06,790
DuPont I don't know if you remember this

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:10,330
so as part of a class project his class

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:14,410
was asked to write a letter to their

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:17,760
hero and I I just if you'll humor me

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:30,220
I would love to roll a quick video here

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:33,850
showing Zach back in 2014 we had a

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:38,530
family PC since uh buck 2010 and in 2012

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:41,470
I started I heard of Linux and I started

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:46,360
experimenting with a lot I think my

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:48,190
first distro was been to 12.04 that I

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,560
tried out in a VirtualBox

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,330
I don't know too much programming I

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,210
don't even know much programming but I

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,390
would still love to learn programming

00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,760
and even get a job maybe someday I could

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:06,340
probably become a sysadmin in Linux I

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:08,950
could help people use Linux it was a

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,380
school project of course I decided to

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,350
send a letter to leanest Torvalds he was

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,910
my hero and I was actually doubting I

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,650
would actually be able to find out you

00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,540
know who act extended to then I

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,970
remembered how much I loved Linux and

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,530
you know how much I wanted to meet you

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,560
Lena's Torvalds so I decided to send him

00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,080
a letter and all my other friends sent

00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,650
letters so you know more Hollywood or

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,920
internet celebrities but I doubt they

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:39,730
actually got flown to you know a good

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,610
place like this to meet them meeting

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,590
Mina's Torvalds was a great experience

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,260
wants the whole panel

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:50,590
was not he went out of the stage on went

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:55,029
to my row and we shook hands and he

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:58,330
signed my Linux Bible and he gave me a

00:19:55,029 --> 00:20:01,960
copy of his just fun book with a

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:05,440
signature of course I loved meeting

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,620
leanest Torvalds and it was a great

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,309
experience overall I got to have got to

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:14,020
have so much goodies or swag and it made

00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:16,600
me think you know all this all these

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:20,549
things like my future is gonna be great

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,549
and you know I loved it

00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:24,480
what a great story

00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:31,630
so you just so happened to have Zach

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,610
here with us today we thought we'd

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:41,200
revisit him a few years later Zach come

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:43,000
on up on stage come on over have a seat

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,330
all right where should I sit

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,220
good to see you again see you Lena now

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,279
as you guys have probably noticed my

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,880
voice has definitely gotten lower since

00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:59,169
I was 12 but I am really excited to be

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,880
here this has been such a great

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:02,500
opportunity and I've always wanted to

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,049
see the West Coast especially Los

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,070
Angeles the City of Angels I think

00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:08,890
that's what it was

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,020
that's right yeah so you you are a high

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,760
school sophomore this year yes I am a

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,350
high school sophomore and you were

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,210
accepted early into the computer

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,640
networking and digital forensics program

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,600
at the Delaware County Technical School

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,090
so how is you have to do a semester time

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,549
yeah we've been we've been we've been

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,260
monitoring you how tell us how you

00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:32,440
decided to apply for that program just

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,990
how well I think what really motivated

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,880
me to apply for that program is I think

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,399
one of my teachers gave me a little

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,169
booklet right and so this booklet had a

00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:43,539
bunch of classes for that technical

00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:44,679
school and one of them popped up there

00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,270
was another one that was like Apple

00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,279
systems InDesign but that was more for

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,690
like artistry you know creating flash

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,399
animations and stuff like that

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,559
there was one that really stood out to

00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:55,019
me though and that

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,509
was the computer networking in digital

00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:59,190
forensics and really and I've been in

00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:01,289
that class for quite a few days now it's

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,539
really good because you get to work

00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:06,870
hands-on with computer hardware and

00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:09,899
software and there's basically so much

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,549
stuff to work with and so far I think

00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:13,919
it's one of the best classes I've ever

00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:15,899
taken and I think it really makes high

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,299
school a lot more fun you know a lot

00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:22,110
more than just your history and your

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:24,869
math and your English you know it's

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,570
definitely been such an enhancing

00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:29,820
experience in in my education that's

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,360
again you had an internship with sa P

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:37,440
this summer and I want to ask you two

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:43,830
questions one what advice do you have to

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:46,169
leanest or balls and the two what do you

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,509
want to do when you graduate but get

00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:51,600
let's start with number one any advice

00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:53,580
for leanest torvalds oh I'd say you've

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,799
um Lina's torvalds have built quite a

00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:59,669
platform over these past 20 years

00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:02,309
and I think in the 2010s the popularity

00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:04,499
of Linux and open source is skyrocketing

00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:07,679
its kind in skyrockets faster and faster

00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:10,679
each year so no matter how popular it

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,169
gets just embrace it because the future

00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:16,470
is going to be centered or a lot around

00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:18,119
technology just like back in whenever

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,070
they first made the TV and the radio

00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,710
that people just started getting

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,929
obsessed with watching and listening to

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,730
broadcasts and I think this is sort of a

00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:29,009
new wave except it's going to be even

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:32,039
bigger because technology doesn't just

00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:34,499
impact entertainment and impacts pretty

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:38,549
much everything in our daily lives and I

00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:42,389
just think that it's so amazing to be a

00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:43,769
part of this revolution we are happy to

00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,940
have you what what do you want to do

00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,740
when you graduate have you given any

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,899
thought to that well I've given a lot of

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,480
thought to that actually and I want to

00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:55,799
make sure I go to a good great you know

00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,570
college and in that video from a few

00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:01,320
years ago I said I wanted to be sort of

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,759
a sysadmin or maybe even program and I'm

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,300
still kind of sticking in the fifth

00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:07,210
seventh you know

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:09,640
to be a sysadmin and basically because I

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,460
mean I think I'd do pretty good as a

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:16,000
developer given the the proper education

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:18,460
but I mean you know programming is nice

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,440
I actually do play around a lot in HTML

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:24,700
despite the fact that I use WordPress on

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,100
my website but the you know the fact is

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,990
is that sysadmin you really get to work

00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,010
hands-on but technology in a business

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,260
and I don't know if it's gonna be a

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,870
largest small business in the future but

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,540
despite that technology is really my

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,120
passion and assist sysadmin job would

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,260
really give me such a it would give me a

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,750
great platform to work my magic you know

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:49,630
and delete any advice for him you got

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,680
any good go back now I'm really happy

00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,630
that people who want to be as

00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:58,330
assignments because they make my life so

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:59,280
much easier great exactly my thoughts

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,800

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,060
