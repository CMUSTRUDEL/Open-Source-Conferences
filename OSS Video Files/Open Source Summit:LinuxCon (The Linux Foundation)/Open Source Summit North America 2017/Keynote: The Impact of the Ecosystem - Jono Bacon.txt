how's everyone doing are we ready

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,370
okay so it's great to be here at the the

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,960
open source something I mean so many so

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,300
many friends and so many new faces I'm

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,620
really excited to be here today and Jim

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,849
already touched on this is a little bit

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,710
of background for those who who I have

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,199
met before I I'm really passionate about

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,060
how we build communities and I served as

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,880
director of community at github at

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,350
Ubuntu and 4x price and these days I run

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,449
my own consulting practice where I work

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,480
with companies to help them to build

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,920
communities either external so developer

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,930
communities are around a product or a

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,790
service or inside of an organization as

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,200
well and part the reason why I did this

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,370
was because I really wanted to expose

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,040
myself to as many different

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,440
organizations as possible so financial

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,390
services or consumer products are

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,649
hardware or whatever else you know and

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,670
it's it's just been a real thrill to

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,190
kind of work with so many different

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,449
companies so one of the reasons why I'm

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,190
really excited to be here today is that

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,510
we're launching a new conference as part

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,690
of the open source summit called the

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,649
open community conference and you know I

00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,940
want to say a big thank you to my

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,160
friends at the Linux Foundation for us

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,359
to do that for us to to kick this off

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,640
and I'll talk about this a little bit

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,229
later on but I first of all really want

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,630
to touch on part of the opportunity

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,299
about why this is happening we've seen a

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,760
huge growth in community and ecosystems

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,380
in the last few years in particular and

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,720
I've been working in this since about

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,390
2000 and it's just been that continual

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,790
growth in interest and excitement from

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,830
organizations to participate and invest

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,600
in building communities and I think part

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,610
of the reason why that is happening is

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,290
that companies have becoming more

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,909
attuned to the opportunities that with

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,280
that they're available in communities

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,900
this includes you know building a better

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,280
user experience and shaping how you

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,710
engage with your users and your

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,509
customers how to bring in feedback and

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,850
build enhancements that you deliver out

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,020
to people how do you scale out support

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,450
how do you help the people who use your

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,009
software to solve their problems without

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,229
just hiring a support team and just

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,579
having those people do it how do you

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,110
build a better brand how do you become

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,520
more well-known in the industry we see

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,229
this every year at the Linux Foundation

00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,520
events where new companies kind of

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,070
appear they participate in the community

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,780
and they become the talk of the town if

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,820
you will and this all results in

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,860
basically a greater level of market

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,160
opportunity and just better technology

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,330
and that's what we all really want so

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,770
we've seen the numbers that kind of

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,280
support this Black Ducks put out

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,900
serve a few years back 78% of

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,240
organizations running open source 66

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,400
building open source for customers 64

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,820
percent participating that's expected to

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,830
grow at 88 percent by next year and to

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,270
me this is this is phenomenally exciting

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,650
right this is exactly the kind of

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,690
investment that we want to see but when

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,120
you zoom out a little bit and you look

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,280
at participation not just in open source

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,630
but in social media in 3d printing in

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,580
map in and other areas we see these

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,920
hockey stick curves where people really

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,840
it taps into a core psychological

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,730
interest in collaborating and

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,980
participating with other people as Linna

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,560
says people want to do meaningful work

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,680
wherever that may be so to me this

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,810
offers really two types of value and I'm

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,060
going to use Wikipedia and Linux as an

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,470
example of this and I think this is

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,610
particularly interesting for those of

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,110
you who are a little bit less familiar

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,640
with this think about these two types of

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,590
value that your organization will kind

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,960
of get from this the first is what I

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,710
would call just content and activity so

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,570
for example Wikipedia 22 million plus

00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,070
articles hundreds of different languages

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,959
these articles have been translated into

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,000
or on the Linux side of things you get

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,080
tens of thousand developers across

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,580
hundreds of different companies

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,800
collaborating together many of which

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,630
compete with each other so fundamentally

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,030
you're creating stuff you're generating

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,230
material that's of value but then the

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,820
second thing and this is something I've

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,000
learned a lot particularly as a

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,590
consultant is is there are just the core

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,420
mechanics and the measuring sticks that

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,760
we have in in business right and one of

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,920
those key mechanics is money so

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,870
Wikipedia valued at tens of billions of

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,310
dollars by the Smithsonian the Linux

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,760
Foundation determined that you food to

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,410
rebuild Fodor I think it was with

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,580
commercial software development dodgy

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,459
will cost about eleven billion dollars

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,660
to do this so it generates material it

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,420
builds a better engagement with your

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,190
audience and it has significant

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,590
financial benefits to an organization as

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,840
well now this is great right this is the

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,870
kind of stuff we want to see there are

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,120
though some wider opportunities in this

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,260
and we've seen this you know one of the

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,020
things I've been doing a lot of research

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,310
in is how we apply in these mechanics of

00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,690
how we build communities not just in

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,570
open-source where this is very familiar

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,669
terra-tory Harley Davidson their owner's

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,140
group the sa P community network over a

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,050
million members attracted to their eco

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,479
systems Procter & Gamble

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,069
to the bean girl community which is kind

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,690
of designed for teenage girls to ask

00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:35,990
sometimes awkward questions that's been

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,030
expanded out to 46 different countries

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,669
and then the Random House figment

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,229
community where their participants are

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,990
creating hundreds of thousands of pieces

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:47,780
of individual content so we're seeing

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,370
the right kind of trends the difficulty

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,080
and this is something I see my work is

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,900
there are common common challenges that

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,190
apply to this one of the one of the

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,750
first ones that I've noticed here is

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,849
that the difference between accidental

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,860
and intentional communities a lot of the

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:02,569
success stories that we see are where

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,580
someone built something and then this

00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,719
community flocked around it and then

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,490
they have to deal with scale like how do

00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,750
we react to this how do we scale this up

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,909
and that's often where you see some

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,949
problems happening and it's also built

00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:13,370
this misnomer that if you build it they

00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:16,370
will come

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,440
sadly people often build it and no one

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,150
shows up right so we need to be

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,520
intentional in the way we think about

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,379
communities and how we design them the

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,389
other thing that I've noticed is you get

00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:29,780
this disconnection between the executive

00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,580
desire for for a community and an

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,930
ecosystem and then the tactical delivery

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,029
of it I say this all the time where

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,949
Community Managers join a company they

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,180
start doing work and they think they're

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,560
doing really valuable work but it's not

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,419
really moving the needle in the same way

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,860
that the executives want to see and I

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,440
think we need to bridge that gap and set

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,360
those expectations more effectively also

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,710
and this is probably gonna annoy a few

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,779
Community Managers in the audience I

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,300
think we need to up our game like

00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:55,250
blogging social media organizing events

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,509
that stuff is really important but we

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,029
need to look at communities as an

00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:01,009
end-to-end experience how do you you

00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:02,960
have someone join your community as an

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,240
individual member and help them to be

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,039
successful as they participate through

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,389
it and that involves designing an

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,279
experience and fundamentally then

00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,900
balancing the the expectations between

00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,490
companies and communities this is where

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,129
we see the most of the I think

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,000
difficulty in organ in open-source

00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:18,139
because there's a company will always

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,659
have way more information than your

00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,430
community now the way I tend to think of

00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:24,110
this is I've kind of designed that what

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,509
I call my community participation model

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,159
and I'll provide an overview of this the

00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,210
basic way in which I think of it is you

00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,919
first of all think about the kind of

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,979
personas you want to attract developers

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,990
advocates translators whatever it might

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,639
be and then what you do is you try to

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,710
determine how do we get those people to

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,590
a first successful piece

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:45,080
work first contribution and we designed

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,340
an on-ramp that gets them there this is

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,080
an area where so many open-source

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,000
projects and companies kind of get it

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,680
wrong it takes ages to get from one end

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
to the other if you can't get someone

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,190
successfully participating within an

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,770
hour in my mind you need to redesign

00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,540
your unwrap then what we do is we pull

00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,850
people in we get people participate into

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,530
their first contribution just something

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,230
of value that's interesting to them and

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,910
also adds value to the community but at

00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,770
that point we now need to keep them

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,600
participating and contribute in

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,100
significant and sustained contributions

00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,350
and that's where I think we delicately

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,060
design a set of incentives and rewards

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,040
that keep people moving forward and

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,960
these needs I think to be intelligent it

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,490
should be crass just throwing t-shirts

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,530
at people doesn't necessarily get you

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,420
anywhere it's a it's the intrinsic

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,640
rewards as well as the extrinsic as well

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,770
then of course we measure all of this

00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,840
not just the the incentives and the

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,190
rewards but the on ramp and the personas

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,040
and the kind of contributions that we're

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,930
seeing and also importantly when people

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,360
participate through this is we foster

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,380
leadership some of the greatest leaders

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,850
that I've ever met they're not

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,950
executives they're just they're just

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,080
active participants and organizations

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,220
because the leaders will then inform and

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,750
guide the rest of the community as it

00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,260
goes through this through this process

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,390
now if you want to hear a little bit

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,290
more about this just as a side note 11

00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,330
o'clock today I'm going to be doing

00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,680
another talk in diamond ballroom 10 and

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,850
I'll dig into this not more detail now I

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,050
want to talk about this for a second

00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,500
part of the reason why I wanted to do

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,150
this conference is because in my work I

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,250
see I meet people all the time I already

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,900
had conversations this morning with

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,430
people who were doing phenomenal work in

00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,130
designing and building communities and

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,570
engaging and I learn from from these

00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,370
folks all the time as we all do from

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,320
each other but I don't think this

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,750
information is packaged up into easy

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,760
easily consumable pieces like my old

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,810
boss at XPrize Peter Diamandis once said

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,000
it's not about having all of the answers

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,310
it's about having the right answers that

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,690
are easily consumable so part the goal

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,130
of the open community conference is to

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,170
provide a place in which people can

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,900
deliver that kind of best practice and

00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,970
it's really divided into three areas one

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,750
is people who are going to get up and

00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,340
they're going to speaker they're going

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,510
to share their experience of build

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,640
building communities and their

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,470
organizations and elsewhere and share

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,550
that in a very accessible and applicable

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,780
way

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,530
the second area here is of course

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,970
networking meeting people hallway track

00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,750
all that kind of stuff all the things

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,580
that we're all familiar with the

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,870
conference's that networking piece is so

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,990
valuable and then the third component

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,460
here is collaboration is I want to

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,720
engender an environment where people are

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,370
going to say well we've got this problem

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,300
and we've got this problem why don't we

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,500
get together and see if we can

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,930
collaborate super we can solve these

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,130
problems the one thing and then I'm

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,810
going to get up the stage that I'm

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,830
really excited to see here is that when

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,630
I started talking to the Linux

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,580
Foundation about this conference and we

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,500
started back from this around as an idea

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,330
it was a little bit of uncharted

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,620
territory there's a lot going on at the

00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,900
open source summit and there's a lot of

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,000
other conferences too and I was really

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,820
delighted to see that for this event we

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,320
had 120 submissions just for the open

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,080
community conference and for the prog

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,530
vent which is happening in October we

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,240
had 85 plus submissions there so one

00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,770
this made my life difficult picking

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,020
things which is a good problem to have

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,880
but two for those of you who are here

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,290
today who didn't get your paper selected

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,020
I just want to say I really appreciate

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,970
you submitting it sorry you couldn't you

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,410
couldn't speak but as you can see there

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,220
was an awful lot of demand for this as

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:03,350
well and here's just a few highlights I

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,150
mean this is just a few examples we've

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,510
got phenomenal people from organizations

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:11,600
like Liz from mesosphere guy from from

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,860
Autodesk we've got topics on on building

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,570
open source programs offices

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,420
bootstrapping communities metrics

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,890
licensing the whole gamut so this event

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,240
is going to be happening it happening as

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,680
one of the track that's happening

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,540
throughout the open-source summit and

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,700
I'm looking forward to meeting all of

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,410
you if you've got any questions feel

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,720

grab me in the hallway whatever is

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,070
necessary and have a great event thank

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,179

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,179
