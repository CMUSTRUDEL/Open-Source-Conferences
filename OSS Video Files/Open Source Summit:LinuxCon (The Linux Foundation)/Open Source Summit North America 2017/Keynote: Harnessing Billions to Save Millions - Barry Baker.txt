code is everywhere it comes from

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,799
beautiful minds hey my name is Eva

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,450
Finland I meant to my name is Ron my

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,700
name is ISA and I do Junior

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,370
my name is Don Juan and with the wonder

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,279
of open source there are always new

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,699
worlds to explore a monitoring tool

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,439
where you can live monitor your Linux

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:25,800
using the negative selection algorithm

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,260
to identify anomalies in limit systems

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,260
to work with on pilings to make it

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,790
running on IBM solutions understand how

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,010
the mapping of commands and works to

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,380
enable better solutions it's not about

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,570
finding the next big thing but having

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,969
the freedom to see how many next big

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,190
things you can find I've been

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,379
contributing the field install project

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,600
using the first day in college and I

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,690
absolutely love doing it it's simply

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,340
dude teacher so let's get to it

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,340
what's code the future

00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:08,300
bad from a district yeah it's great to

00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:10,430
be here today that video also reminded

00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,140
me of what I felt like when I was an

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,920
undergrad just getting my feet wet with

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,080
with open-source and using Linux I was

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,940
hooked from the moment it started I was

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,040
hooked on the speed I was hooked on the

00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,840
ability to get things done and I was

00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,490
hooked on the ability to contribute back

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,570
and share with others what I was able to

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,460
do when I joined IBM nothing changed

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,070
except that actually got more dramatic I

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,440
was able to be on software teams use

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,240
more open-source and lead teams and

00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:43,760
contribute that much more back to the

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:48,310
community and now today I have Linux in

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,310
my title at IBM so how cool is that

00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,479
Linux one if you're not familiar with it

00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:56,330
is a family of highly engineered systems

00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,880
that combine the best of open and Linux

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,500
with the best of enterprise computing

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,420
I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,369
what we've been up to around Linux once

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,960
a day and then have Shaun come up and

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:10,250
tell an awesome story about how he's

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,950
helping to change the world I don't have

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,260
to tell you all about the importance of

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,880
open source but I also do think it's

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,220
helpful every once in a while to engage

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,840
in a little thought experiment what

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,980
would the world be like without open

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:29,260
source to me we'd probably end up with a

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:33,640
handful of very large tech companies IBM

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,050
producing may be mediocre software and

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,830
not a lot of innovation not a lot of

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:43,600
motivation to innovate we'd be in short

00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,600
decades behind where we are today

00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:49,730
but where we are today is very different

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,010
we have countless open source projects

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,410
that many of you all are involved in

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,480
that are tackling and going after great

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,190
opportunities but also at the same time

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,090
tackling some of the most vexing

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,790
challenges that we face developers are

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,500
collaborating in their code and code is

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,790
the engine that's going to drive us

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,920
forward

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,560
opensource plays a critical role in how

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,800
bad how fast we can innovate but also

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,670
how fast we can deploy new technologies

00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,590
once they are made available an IBM has

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,220
been a very active participant in

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,830
open-source for years we were an

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,080
original funder of the OSD l a precursor

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,470
to the Linux Foundation we've created

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,080
dozens of projects and all told we have

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,180
over tens of thousands of employees that

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,100
contribute to open source on a regular

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,989
basis up here are a few recent projects

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,760
that we've been very active in I'll

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,220
touch a little bit on hyper ledger

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,890
because we're convinced of its power to

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,430
drive new innovative business models and

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,560
transform industries a year and a half

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,920
ago it was created the hyper ledger

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,720
project with 19 general members now

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,880
there are over a hundred and thirty it's

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,970
one of the fastest if not the fastest

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,519
project in open in in the Linux

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,160
Foundation history if you haven't

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,810
started to play around with hyper ledger

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,790
you can get started today we have a

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,829
plenty of SMEs that can help you get

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,550
engaged and get you plugged in and going

00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:27,180
and at IBM we're delivering a premier

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:30,360
blockchain solution it's fully

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,390
integrated it's ready to go it allows

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,580
you to develop govern and operate a

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,190
blockchain network across multiple

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,070
entities be it companies be it partners

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,240
be it others in the industry it was

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:47,610
built on over 400 engagements that we've

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,970
had with clients and partners it's

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,520
flexible software as a service but it's

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,070
built on open source it's delivered

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,800
through IBM cloud and it's powered and

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,500
secured by Linux one that's right when

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,410
you go to IBM comm and the COBE M Cloud

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,300
and provision a blockchain service it's

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:11,100
actually running on the Linux one server

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,320
in our cloud data centers there are many

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,229
companies and partners that were working

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,870
with to create very innovative solutions

00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:21,389
and I'm showing a few up here intellect

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,150
EU is integrating new

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:28,409
blockchain business processes with core

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:31,979
legacy systems ever ledger is trying to

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:35,159
take fraud and abuse out of the supply

00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,050
chain for high-value goods and secure

00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:38,819
keys doing nothing short of trying to

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,620
create the next generation of identity

00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:45,780
and authentication solutions for the

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:49,740
modern world and as we like to say you ^

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,599
IBM you worry about your code you worry

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,430
about delivering that next new

00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:55,740
innovation that thing that's going to

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,050
change the world and you let us worry

00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,870
about delivering systems that will

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,939
deliver performance at scale

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:08,039
availability at scale and security at

00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:10,379
scale and just on this point I know

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,060
Joseph was just up here and the story

00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,740
around hit record is awesome from a

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,270
collaboration perspective but I wanted

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:20,219
to make another tie-in to Edward Snowden

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:22,650
and his work in that portrayal what at

00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:24,629
what what was what Edward Snowden did

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,370
you know you have you may have your

00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,219
opinion on it regardless of what that

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,529
opinion is what he laid bare was the

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,259
fact that there is a tremendous amount

00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:36,539
of opportunity out there and and threats

00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,389
from both the outside of your company

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:43,080
but also within your company those

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:45,089
internal threats can have access to you

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,339
know compromised credentials or elevated

00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:51,150
credentials that can give them a wide

00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:53,750
range of of access to critical data not

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:57,389
many days go by without a data breach

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,759
that data is a company's data but really

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,710
it's your data right every day we see

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,839
something in the news about how our data

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,460
about our personal lives is being

00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,509
compromised and put in the hands of

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:12,330
others and with Linux one we've created

00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,430
unique security infrastructure to help

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,490
protect against internal and external

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,250
threats it's known as secure service

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,349
containers this is a firmware based

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,120
secure Linux environment that offers

00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:26,189
tamper resistance and pervasive

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,740
encryption of the entire stack of

00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:32,610
software and the data that is running in

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,500
the container if an administrator wanted

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,600
to or was asked

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,580
to provide the contents of what's

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,760
running in that container they'd not be

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,520
able to do this this underpins our

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,440
blockchain offering and as up until now

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,390
really only been available through that

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,910
blockchain offering what we are

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,430
announcing today is that we are

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,530
announcing a beta as we start to open up

00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:02,520
this technology and make it more broadly

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:04,460
applicable and available additionally as

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,590
I mentioned at the start

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,419
two years ago we introduced the Linux

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,870
one family to the world we did it at

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:16,440
Linux con at the time we introduced two

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:19,919
systems the Emporer the bigger one and

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,380
the Rockhopper a smaller one and today

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,130
we are announcing another family member

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:29,730
the emperor - we've continued to

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,430
innovate across the entire stack that we

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,500
provide that goes all the way down to

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,090
the microprocessor where we've delivered

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,180
new capabilities for symmetric

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,430
multi-threading sim D we've increased

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,330
the amount of silicon we've devoted to

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:47,460
encryption by 4x you move up a layer

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,070
into the system design we deliver an

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,010
overall balanced system design that

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,560
allows you to scale up and support data

00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:00,089
serving and cloud services in a secure

00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,960
manner what this allows you to do again

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:06,330
is to not worry about things like

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,610
scalability security performance and

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,080
again get back to and focused on

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,490
delivering capabilities that are gonna

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,860
help you achieve your goals we have

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,240
three clients that I'm showing here just

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,580
to give you a sense of what they're

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,130
doing with the technology Huawei Express

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,380
is a transportation provider in China

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,740
that is enabling the purchase of mobile

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,070
tickets for buses and trains from their

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,670
mobile phone to the Chinese population

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:37,700
not a small population Sinfonia rx

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,220
provides medical therapy management

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:45,180
treatment programs for one out of seven

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,329
US citizens in cognition Foundry is

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,309
building out secure premium services

00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:52,410
that allows startups to get going really

00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:56,629
fast and deliver technology and their

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:59,970
solutions in a secure way and at scale

00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,980
and now I'd like to have Sean invite

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,350
Sean franksen up to tell his story

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,480
Sean's the co-founder of plastic bank

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,579
and it hope you're gonna be interested

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,579
in how he's changing the world John

00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:18,569
hello my name is Sean Franklin I'm the

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,540
co-founder of a company called the

00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:24,839
plastic bank and at the plastic bank we

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:29,309
are on a mission to use code to stop

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,889
ocean plastic this is so important every

00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,619
minute of every day a garbage truck

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,540
worth the plastic enters our ocean this

00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:38,579
is like filling this entire room with

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:42,540
plastic every couple minutes just

00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:44,459
dumping it into the Seas and you know

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,439
it's so important that we look at the

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:49,559
grand challenges we face in the world

00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:52,230
and not get upset but just see the

00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:55,410
opportunities of solving these problems

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,239
with code and honestly the more messed

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,179
up that I see the world's getting the

00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:02,399
more optimistic I am that code will be

00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:05,040
the script that saves this planet and

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,720
you know I'm inspired with how can we

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,869
solve these grand challenges with code

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,949
so I'd like to show what we're doing to

00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:16,649
use code and technology to stop ocean

00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:20,699
plastic while reducing global poverty at

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:23,040
the same time and for us it starts with

00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:25,649
the riddle if you walked into the

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,600
kitchen and the sink was overflowing you

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:29,579
have water pouring onto the floor and

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,100
just piling up and all you have is a

00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:35,369
bucket and a mop what do you do first

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,459
and the answer simply you turn off the

00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:41,519
tap as pouring it's important as it is

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:44,639
to take the plastic out of the ocean the

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,220
real step one root cause is how can we

00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,429
use technology to turn off the tap and

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,309
stop the flow of ocean plastic so we

00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:56,759
discovered that 80% of ocean plastic

00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:58,169
actually starts on land in developing

00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,820
countries where they have almost no

00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:02,410
waste management system

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,260
it's actually common practice in these

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,210
regions to just throw the plastic into

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,900
the rivers the canals and the ocean down

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:13,840
waterways and they do it because they

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,690
see plastic of waste but if you think

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,540
about it if every piece of plastic if

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,940
every bottle was worth five dollars we

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,130
wouldn't have a single piece of plastic

00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,950
garbage on this planet so the difference

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,920
between garbage and value is simply

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,380
perception so we look at ways to use

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,170
technology to reveal the value in

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:39,240
plastic to make plastic too valuable to

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:42,610
enter the ocean so we set up recycling

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,350
ecosystems around the world we make it

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,050
possible for someone to just go out

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,779
collect plastic and earn a living all

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,170
the plastic we collect is called social

00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:55,480
plastic and we create these reward and

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,839
incentive systems to bring in social

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,070
plastic have it sorted recycled and then

00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,589
we sell it to some of the world's

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,630
largest companies to turn into products

00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:07,420
so that these companies can say that

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,660
this product helps stop ocean plastic

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,420
while improving people's lives and we

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,790
have just had an amazing response we've

00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,810
had millions of people on social media

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,730
ask corporations to social plastic we've

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,610
had thousands of people come to us and

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,230
we get calls daily of asking how can we

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,860
bring the plastic bank to my country and

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,990
it was just huge demand and self proof

00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:35,950
and social proof that has really just

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:38,320
brought the need to scale overnight we

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,960
need to go from nothing to exponential

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,040
we need to develop and deploy we needed

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,500
safety security trust honestly we needed

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,750
help and the beautiful thing is when you

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,060
create a movement and an awareness of

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,550
what you're trying to do you attract the

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,580
right people who can genuinely help do

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,130
what you're trying to do so we had

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,709
cognition foundry come to us so Ron

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,600
argent heard what we're doing kind of

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:07,420
had an idea of where we're trying to go

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,220
and when he painted the picture of the

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,490
tools and technology that can get us

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,440
there it was just an amazing fit we

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,080
because my business partner and I we're

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,180
technology entrepreneurs but we have no

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,709
idea how to scale a technology globally

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,990
but when we can have the partners

00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:24,910
working with us putting the right minds

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,870
together the right tools together

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:31,350
literally everything became possible so

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,880
for us the foundation of what we do is

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:37,510
blockchain and hyper ledger fabric on

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,630
Linux one you know the backend system is

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:44,410
go language and Postgres the front-end

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,839
system is Apache cardova angular 2 and

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,899
what this does is it creates an entire

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,570
ecosystem where all parts of the

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:55,089
recycling chain can be united so the app

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,100
based platform that we have at its core

00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,910
starts with the digital wallet where we

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,020
have an asset-backed token where when

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,089
we're in the world's most vulnerable

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,529
economies where you can't have a bank

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,020
account where it's dangerous to have

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,300
cash we can actually replace these

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,120
entire recycling ecosystems and allow

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,700
someone who doesn't qualify for a bank

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,520
account to safely save through recycling

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,230
and we start building these ecosystems

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,810
where the app goes beyond a basic user

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,029
and has it where anyone can operate a

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,709
plastics exchange system in any country

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:29,140
in the world where they can become

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:32,050
eligible to receive the plastic bank

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,180
digital rewards and slowly have an

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,579
entire economy we're outside of

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,980
recycling even anyone can operate a

00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,510
storefront with the real vision that

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,370
anyone in the world can operate a

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,860
convenience store for the world's poor

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,170
where they can afford everything through

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:50,620
recycling which provides complete

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:53,079
financial inclusion and again this is

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,510
entirely done because some of the

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:58,180
world's largest corporations are buying

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,490
the plastic to use in products and very

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,440
much like Fairtrade we're able to pass

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,570
on that value to the collector who needs

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,270
it but at the same time when products

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,320
are made we have blockchain

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,390
authenticated supply chains we have

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,610
blockchain authenticated social and

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:15,700
environmental impacts and this is when

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,430
we can really bring trust back to the

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,470
world of technology and back to the

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,329
world of doing good I mean one of the

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,610
hardest challenges is how do you deliver

00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:25,010
on the promise of doing good and have

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,470
the word

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,820
trust it and for us it's all about those

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:34,910
trust stamps blockchain is a trust in

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:37,340
Linux one is a trusted and honestly for

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,470
us IBM is a trust stamp when it comes to

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,870
our investors our partners when people

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,880
ask you know as a start-up how do you

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,040
plan on scaling around the planet

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,400
it's these trust stamps that really make

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,440
everything possible and you know for us

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,940
it's been an amazing lesson because one

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,040
of the challenges is how do you develop

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,010
technology for the world's bottom

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,060
billion but at the same time I just get

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,920
so inspired because code is universal

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,579
code speaks all languages and code

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,230
crosses all borders which encourage all

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,420
of you in any of the applications you

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,300
build if you can have a way that it

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,490
doesn't exclude the bottom billion

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,110
there's a huge opportunity because we've

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,900
been through the slums of the world we

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:22,970
work in multiple countries and almost

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,770
every single person even in the worst

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,990
conditions nowadays have a cell phone

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,180
and more often the world's bottom

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,150
billion as a smartphone and as

00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,980
applications which means any of the code

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,170
were building any of the platforms we're

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,990
building can literally be used by the

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,270
world and when we have that mentality of

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,490
how can we include the bottom billion

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,220
that is the next billion users the next

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:49,370
billion customers and again the reason

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:52,490
that I get inspired and optimistic about

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,620
the future this planet is it well I have

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,810
open source codes and we can build on

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,300
things and have one solution make

00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:02,300
another one possible this is really when

00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:05,330
I think this script to save this planet

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,310
will be written in code and I thank all

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,520
of you for playing your part so thank

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,520
you

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,190
thank Thank You Sean and for the work

00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,500
you're doing at plastic bank and with

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,750
cognition foundry it's really awesome

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,760
great to see we've been inspired by it

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,250
