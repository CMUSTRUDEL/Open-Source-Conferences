all right well thank you all very much

00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,710
for sticking around I just learned

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,810
actually that apparently puppy Palooza

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,519
is up right now so or like five minutes

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,929
so this is about to turn into a

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,840
lightning talk as I'm sure everybody

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,250
wants to go do that

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,770
well actually great Jim already said who

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,670
I was we're all good on that you know

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,520
what I kind of wanted to talk about

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,560
today was operations and open source and

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,789
what we as open source contributors and

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,619
leaders really need to be thinking about

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,439
and doing in the context of certainly

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,730
the scene cf generally cloud native and

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,980
really you know micro services in

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,480
general so in the event you were living

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,860
underneath a rock will do the quick you

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,110
know what are micro services we can all

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,690
be on the same page they're distributed

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,100
system they were you know predated by

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,690
Enterprise Service bus as an SOA which

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,480
is predated by Corbett which is predated

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,250
by RPC and like on and on effectively

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,570
they are in kind of my words I think

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,610
many people's words the UNIX philosophy

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,559
applied to distributed systems and

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,480
scaling so you know the UNIX philosophy

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,550
says do one thing do it well there's a

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,230
bunch of other stuff we do that with

00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,550
network services we basically say cool

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,910
we're going to take a thing and capsule

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,710
it up data business logic and really put

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,720
that on a network behind an endpoint

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,280
that is only accessible on the network

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,979
and that thing is sort of independently

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,200
manageable importantly it gives us an

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,210
independent domain for logic for data

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,860
and for sort of fault tolerance and

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,570
scaling and then of course we have a

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,740
giant application that sort of stitches

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,509
all these things together right this is

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,130
all kind of bread and butter um I do

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,570
think something that has been overlooked

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,009
until the last probably a year or two

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,840
which I'm really glad this is becoming

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,119
more of a trend as people talking about

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
how when we want to use micro services

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,390
to scale it applies to both technology

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,880
like we were like AWS I'm gonna build a

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,320
thing that does 10 million TPS but it's

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,360
also the way we scale our engineering

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,979
orgs and we scale in terms of people and

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,090
I think that intersection is really what

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,439
you know want to talk about for the rest

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,540
of this and just sort of like what's

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,799
hard about it and what we want to do you

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,600
know kind of going forward what we've

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,250
always just think about it and I do

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,799
think the the kind of the last point to

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,689
kind of make on that is take us two

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,310
points is you know when you're building

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,649
micro services you're doing it to scale

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,270
it's the only game in town you're going

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,369
to sacrifice everything in terms of

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,549
complexity cost everything in order to

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,110
get that scale and the reality of you

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,610
know once you go to implement this is to

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,289
implement them you have to be good at

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,120
operations as an organization and most

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,500
shops aren't and I know everybody's out

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,760
there like oh cool the Oracle

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,220
eyes up here telling us about how

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,750
enterprises aren't good at operations or

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,460
you know the banks can't do it etc it's

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,570
it's actually everybody

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,010
it doesn't matter I've been doing this

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,180
for a long time it doesn't matter if

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,220
you're talking about startups or you're

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,500
talking about unicorns or the banks or

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,820
whatever most places like Frankie the

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,260
Coulomb gonna get some Redis and nodejs

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,150
and string them together and call it a

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,380
day and it's actually much harder than

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,790
that if you want to succeed at scale

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,020
right obviously as all the projects

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,250
you've heard about for the last day I've

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,190
been talking about our last three days

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,040
so we'll start with organizations and

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,390
come back to technology at the end yes I

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,280
do know what irony means in case you're

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,959
wondering this is a comic that are we

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,610
seen for a long time since like 2011

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,470
that kind of describes you know some

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,300
some org charts and if you looked at

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,040
this from 2011 really there are a few

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,330
and I literally mean a few companies on

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,860
that chart that we're good at doing

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,209
operations and good at building micro

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,620
services and I think you know we sort of

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,800
sort of padding matching pattern

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,810
matching ourselves to that going forward

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,280
so I'll give you my very biased input on

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,420
what I've seen work and kind of like how

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,060
we're thinking about it is we're

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,370
building all this new stuff that Oracle

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,720
you know I've spent a lot of time at

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,190
Amazon a lot of people have done this

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,040
there too Pizza mantra really is

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,360
effective if you're not familiar with it

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,130
basically it's a very clever marketing

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,900
term from their HR department that

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,209
describes basically building five to ten

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,890
person teams it works really well it

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,019
ascribes as well cool if unless you have

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,430
a bunch of hungry people like me you can

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,890
feed the team with two pizzas that's

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,390
kind of the gist the real point of this

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,010
though is you have these small teams

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,420
that are autonomous and accountable and

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,590
you have a lot of them right and then

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,970
they all go independently they're not

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,040
blocked in each other they're decoupled

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,180
they own their own destiny so when

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,680
you're one of these teams you're like

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,060
okay I own everything about product

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,070
requirements just inception my

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,680
technology stack operations support

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,940
really everything and then Amazon sort

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,350
of has this classic fitness function

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,060
model they apply to it which is just

00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,829
like a single you know thumbs-up

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,570
thumbs-down kind of goal that you can

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,340
hold the team accountable to and

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,920
ultimately change over time if they meet

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,959
it or don't meet it so it works really

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,750
well it goes to scale really fast as an

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,980
org basically having a bunch of chaos

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,750
what it doesn't do is have like an

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,070
actual product autonomy very well so you

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,510
end up with a bunch of warring factions

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,040
and tribes fight with each other and

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,720
there's all sorts of other bad sides

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
that come with it so there's a lot of

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,479
other things like from you know Apple

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,590
Google other you know Oracle other

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,390
places in the industry

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,800
that kind of blend us more the sort of a

00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,599
centralized model like Google's got a

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,190
very famous as a recolor

00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:30,599
if you've not read up on the air budget

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,250
stuff I think it's actually one of the

00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,840
best concepts and operations in a long

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,430
time it's awesome

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,900
you know apples got a very centric

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,970
product model obviously like as the

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,289
chart kind of showed so I I think you

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,789
kind of want to take a blend of these

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:43,229
things but you know fundamentally you're

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:47,400
gonna have a bunch of small autonomous

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:49,169
teams going really fast what actually

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,520
happens to is as well as you build up

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,840
this organization you have lots of

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,669
people building lots of independent

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,470
services you always have kind of this

00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,879
like emergence of these platform teams

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,860
that solve a bunch of the common crap

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,270
nobody wants to build right like you

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,199
know suppose we're gonna Braille we're

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,490
gonna be in the and we're gonna be in

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,710
the emoji business right because like

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,719
that's clearly hot these days and

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,280
you know the the focus of the company is

00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,930
almost always towards the user facing

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,219
customer facing side of the world and so

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,199
the the team that actually serves up

00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,879
emojis gets all the money or all the

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,379
attention and you have the kind of these

00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,940
teams that their customers are really

00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,159
internal customers that emerge they

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,449
solve you know stuff like off you know

00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,099
nobody ever wants to deal with storage

00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,569
and unless you're a masochist

00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:26,460
nobody ever wants to deal with like kind

00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,659
of setting up telemetry services etc so

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,210
like those kind of teams emerge

00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,680
basically to serve the other teams and

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,389
now you know importantly remember all

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,520
these people can go very fast can choose

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,469
their own destiny in the very early days

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,000
you generally find okay cool the emoji

00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,740
team is like all aligned with the

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,759
platform teams and like you know

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,229
everybody's happy because we're all

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,759
building things at the same time and

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,099
that's all fine but of course tech moves

00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,690
fast you know 18 months in you know the

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,219
new ant emojis come out right and we

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,229
clearly we're going to start all over

00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:53,580
because that's the new thing and there's

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,870
always kind of this tension when the new

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,360
teams come out or you ended up with a

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,150
rewrite or whatever whether to sort of

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,800
Bank on stability and bet on what was

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,750
what was there before or bet on

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,919
innovation or fashion right so you know

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,139
you're always going to have this kind of

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,699
tension which is frankly good in terms

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,930
of what the technology stack is going to

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,930
look like and any one of these teams

00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:19,500
maybe there we go so regardless of which

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,580
which kind of team you are like you're

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,259
one of these teams you're still gonna

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,550
have to solve your problems you still

00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,849
have to pick a stack and ends up looking

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,319
the same for everybody it's 2017 the

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:29,430
reality of what everybody's gonna do is

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,590
they're gonna use a mix of cloud and

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,090
open source right so what I've been

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,620
saying for a long time or tell people

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,270
told people for a long time like cloud

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,139
or this route is outsourced operation

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,699
it's like at the end of the day that's

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,690
what you're paying for like because of

00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,800
course if you could run everything

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,659
yourself like of course you

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,240
you want to but the reality is is

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,530
expensive and you probably can't so you

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,759
know typically people are gonna use as

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,960
much cloud as they can because what

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,030
you're getting is effectively like a

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,650
financial contract of how to achieve an

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,879
SLA from somebody else and you can you

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,009
know hold them over a barrel whenever

00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,210
they break that but a lot of times it

00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,099
doesn't work for you right like the

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,180
interfaces are wrong the SLA is don't

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,530
meet your needs like you're gonna have

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,180
to like not you're gonna always end up

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,250
in this kind of build versus buy versus

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,750
blend mode so you're gonna use much as

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,069
cloud as you can because it's easy and

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,629
then when you're not gonna be able use

00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,039
cloud you're gonna use open-source right

00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,750
that's that's the reality and your news

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,699
open source very specifically because it

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,259
gives you transparency so if you're the

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,120
team that's accountable for your destiny

00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,680
for your destiny like top to bottom like

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,449
what other choice do you have besides to

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
bet on software that you can crack under

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,870
open and get under the hood and actually

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,909
introspect everything and understand it

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,319
like it's super important so this is why

00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,969
like this is the state of the world it's

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,129
all obvious I think at this point it's

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:34,710
sort of self-evident by the industry but

00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,879
that's what you're going to do you know

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,379
kind of the interesting thing is there's

00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,610
this ton of stuff out there right so you

00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,050
know I can poke a little fun at this

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,969
given you know Oracle just announced

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,590
we're part of the C&C F now this is the

00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:45,330
CNC F landscape page I'm sure you've all

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,610
seen it there's a ton of up there

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,889
right like there's a lot of stuff and

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,210
the if there's awesome right like it's

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,800
you know we're exponentially better off

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,300
this year than we were last year and

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,310
like orders of magnitude than a decade

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,449
ago I can guarantee you but the reality

00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,190
is none of that stuff actually works

00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,210
together right like it doesn't you have

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,590
all these things to kind of you'd go

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,150
into penalty and some things are good

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,039
and some things are crap and somebody's

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,690
to put it all together and this is

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,099
always much harder than everybody thinks

00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,210
so you end up like as a team that you

00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,500
have to build this you know you're gonna

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,000
build the an emoji service and we're

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,270
gonna go kill it on the iPhone whatever

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,409
it is now x10 I don't even know you know

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,479
you're gonna have to spend a lot more

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,129
time than you think putting all this

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,659
software together like this is this is

00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,830
the fundamental problem most places end

00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,650
up to and you end up with there's a ton

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,719
of them you know reinventing the wheel

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,340
it's always very difficult for people to

00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:31,560
come up with an executable plan that

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,240
gets them to meet their SLA goals

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,320
Frankie as I said at the very beginning

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,669
a bunch of people don't do that they

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,380
kind of start with like well I'll put

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,370
some stuff Redis and nodejs together and

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,630
call it a day

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,099
that works for a while until you

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,329
actually get some success and then of

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,620
course it burns to the ground and you

00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:45,149
have Twitter fail wails or you know

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,779
whatever look whatever the name is these

00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:51,029
days so it's hard is the real point to

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,380
this and I guess the point to now wrap

00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,249
this up or you know to bring it home so

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,230
every we can go pet puppies

00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:58,449
you know open-source has always been

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,579
about transparency and empowering

00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:02,619
end-users right like back in the day

00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:04,029
I don't know Chris raise the hands of

00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,499
how many people were not here before you

00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:07,209
know Microsoft was the devil right like

00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:08,709
we're all getting locked into Windows on

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,209
our laptops we hate them we have to have

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,399
Linux on the desktop is coming in a year

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:14,290
now awesome by the way Microsoft we love

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,730
you now we know you're awesome but that

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,350
like that's that's what it were existed

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,759
for way back then right and now the

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,139
world is a little bit changed like today

00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,399
the cloud industry is sort of the

00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:23,860
distributed systems industry has

00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,779
McCleary been built up around open

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,249
source and has to empower teams like as

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:28,420
it's doing today so I'm not telling you

00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:30,249
this because it doesn't do it obviously

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,949
it does but there's more we have to do

00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:34,649
so my real argument to all of us in the

00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:38,110
room is we have to think about how we

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,910
empower teams better going forward to

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,529
build operation software build software

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,629
that can be operable and it really means

00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:45,279
be consumed by one of these team but one

00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:47,439
of these organizations is building micro

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,029
services so I actually had a ton of

00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:50,529
stuff on the first version of slide like

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,759
we were talking about like what's harder

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:53,110
versioning and deployment of stuff I

00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,939
tried to boil it down to like a very

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,959
small set of like three things that

00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:58,149
everybody could like kind of take away

00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,589
and the point of this I think is more to

00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,860
have a discussion than actually like a

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:04,179
mandate so this is just my mental model

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,160
like number one this is really a

00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,929
reflection of what's hard it's actually

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,370
very hard for people to consume software

00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:11,110
and deploy it obviously kubernetes and

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,389
docker really have changed the world and

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,050
that does help a lot so I think that one

00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:17,199
is the one that is the easiest

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,639
line-of-sight to of great we have we do

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,309
that that makes that problem a lot

00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,809
better but we still could do it the

00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:25,660
other two I think are not quite so

00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:27,399
simple so observability is always like

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,959
that when you have to operate software

00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,600
right like the the Yaeger stuff is

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,309
awesome it really is you know we've

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,689
you've all been building scrap from

00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:37,329
scratch for the last ten years to

00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:38,889
operate software observability really is

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,420
like the root important thing you have

00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,069
to have but there's always kind of this

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,360
thing I think that people think well

00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:45,579
because I get this like x-ray or

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,279
microscope I now understand everything

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,449
and the reality is you're not going to

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,949
like in the system space we've had

00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,629
DTrace and system trap and all these

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,420
other system tap all these are like

00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:57,009
amazing tools that help us understand

00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,869
what's going on in the operating system

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,309
itself but the reality is unless you're

00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,569
a kernel developer or Brendan Gregg

00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:03,790
you're probably not going to figure out

00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:05,649
what all that stuff is so you know the

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,320
real burden that is sort of like giving

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,690
the person that has to consume this off

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,100
the software the ability to operate it

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,420
in their environment when what they care

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,540
about is building like an an emoji

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,769
service or whatever so I think the way

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,110
that we get there is by saying as

00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,610
software authors like it's on us to pre

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,430
instrument software it's on us to like

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,139
basically say okay I understand what

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,699
people need to look for more than better

00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,139
than anybody I understand what people

00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:29,670
need to look for I understand what they

00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,529
need to do when one of these alarms gets

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,089
caught certainly give me the trace

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:35,550
points and tell me what the trace points

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,139
are as ideally give me a dashboard that

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,819
I can just quickly drop in and get going

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,079
with like I think that's a huge one like

00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:42,120
more than anything that'd be the number

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,040
one thing I think we as open-source

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,300
authors need to start focusing on when

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,519
we build projects that are meant to

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,810
scale and the other one is it kind of

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,329
just to take those hand-in-hand with

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,920
that as testability and I don't mean

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:54,569
that like when I run make tests I get

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,550
Unicode checkmarks or whatever the cool

00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:58,620
thing is to do these days it's really

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,509
that I that I can do actual proper chaos

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,949
testing and chaos testing as we all you

00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:04,079
know chaos monkey buddy kind of runs in

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,029
AWS and it blow stuff up and that's

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,860
actually kind of easy to reason about I

00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,600
always find like what's difficult is

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,160
black out versus Brown out testing Brown

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,230
out testing is much harder to deal with

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,790
so you know what what we have to do

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,870
though is like and you know you have to

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,310
assume that if you're building one of

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,649
these online massive you know

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,970
consumer-facing web-scale systems you're

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,139
going to be doing production testing

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,339
you're going to be blowing stuff up in

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,470
production because if you're not doing

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:27,660
that you actually have no idea if your

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,130
system can recover like most places the

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,750
production environment is so large you

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,000
literally can't recreate it so it's the

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,949
only place you can actually do this so

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,149
it's on us as software authors to assume

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:38,250
that that's the environment these things

00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:40,440
are going into and give people sort of

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,240
the the the explain ability and the

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,069
consume ability to go run that and tell

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,360
them like what to look for how it's

00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:46,800
going to break and like how to you know

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,029
validate this recovered and obviously

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,699
this goes hand in hand with

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,449
observability so I told it to be a

00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:52,560
lightning talk

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:54,300
I think I'm two minutes ahead of

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,130
schedule so I'll get through this in 60

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,829
seconds or less of puppies

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,449
how is Oracle gonna help is I think kind

00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,889
of like tie this all back up so you know

00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:03,139
we're announced we're in the CNC F today

00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:06,600
we're going to make that mean something

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:07,889
I'm sincerely we've already announced

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,300
that we're putting a lot of people and a

00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,860
lot of effort into kubernetes we've been

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,329
doing a lot on Federation and sync

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,250
testing specifically we're going to keep

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:16,079
doing a lot more there we've put out

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,300
some tools ourselves that we find super

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,070
useful specifically it targeted sort of

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,660
operability and security so one of these

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,910
cart that's my personal favorite let's

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,560
you kind of like debug post-mortem any

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,050
crash containers it's awesome check it

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,370
out it's on github we're gonna keep

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,320
putting a lot into this this is you know

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,870
very passionate this is a super huge

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,340
belief of mind that like operations is

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,140
actually the hard part of building cloud

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,220
systems and building micro services so

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,350
this is where we're going to see a ton

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,210
of effort from us we believe in it very

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,530
fervently and you know of course open

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,120
world is coming up that's like Christmas

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,560
time at Oracle so there's me a ton of

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,820
announcements but stay tuned to us

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,020
around stuff around open source

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,340
specifically and you know over the next

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,870
year there's gonna be a lot more from us

00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,720
coming on this so thank you everybody

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,720
