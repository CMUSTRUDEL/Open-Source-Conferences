	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,920
so hello everyone it's good to see folks

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,930
out in the audience that's good to have

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,719
folks make a fairly fairly early keynote

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,030
but today I'm gonna talk a little bit

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,790
about some updates from the cloud native

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,650
computing foundation which I helped form

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,380
a couple years ago when I joined the

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,869
Linux Foundation formally so to give you

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,710
a little bit of history the CN CF was

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:29,760
formed in about mid 2015 with the simple

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,430
mission of bringing a form of computing

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,510
called cloud native computing

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,820
essentially to the world and you know

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,829
when I say cloud native I essentially

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,260
refer to the type of computing that has

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,540
been pioneered by internet scale

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,090
companies such as Google Facebook

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,160
Twitter and so on who have essentially

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,530
been running microservices based

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,600
architectures that run in containers

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,489
that are centrally orchestrated by some

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,230
you know central process you know over

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,180
you know you know hundreds of thousands

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,520
of machines and so you know this is the

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,690
type of computing you know you know that

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,550
I refer to when I say cloud native

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,060
computing so you know when we were

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,790
founded in mid-2015 we started with a

00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,799
humble set of 22 members and a kind of a

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,350
very basic MIT you know mission

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,180
statement and at the time google also

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,369
seeded the project of kubernetes which

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,840
i'm sure some of you may have heard of

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,759
that project yeah everyone knows what

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,710
kubernetes is I'm assuming yes yeah it's

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,270
been you'd be surprised a couple years

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,159
ago not not too many people knew what

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,229
kubernetes was but you know it was good

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,320
we were started with 22 members I'm

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,670
happy to announce two years later

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,140
roughly we've had some great growth so

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,140
you know we have basically over 5x

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,119
growth in terms of membership within C

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,189
and C F today we have about 118 members

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,560
and I'm super stoked essentially to have

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,290
all these companies involved basically

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,659
trying to move for the cloud native

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,299
mission and you know if you kind of step

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,840
back a little bit I think this is really

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,530
the first time in the history of

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,210
open-source especially in the

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,520
infrastructure space that we have really

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,979
the top five leading cloud public cloud

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,520
providers in the world sitting at the

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,829
same same foundation table driving cloud

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,709
native forward so I'm super stoked to

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,080
have that happen but for some of you

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,630
that may have been paying attention on

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,150
the preview

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,040
slide you know we do have new members

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,440
that occasionally come and join us

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,230
within the ciencia family so today I

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,450
would like to announce one of those and

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,520
I would like to welcome John middle

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,590
house sir from Oracle to talk a little

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,000
bit about what's going on on their side

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:41,170
of the world and cloud native land so

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:44,650
welcome John thanks Chris as Chris said

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,030
we have joined CN CF so announcement is

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,060
fairly self-explanatory

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,720
I am VP of engineering of a group within

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,180
Oracle whose Charter is to drive cloud

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,800
native development all the developer

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,150
tools so we're very active we've been

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,610
active for a while we've been kind of

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,350
unofficially members and are proud to

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,630
announce that we are now officially a

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,970
Platinum Member and I am on the

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,220
governing board as well as everybody

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,960
else who goes up on that stage so we

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,520
have a couple of announcements today of

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,360
specific products and then we have more

00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:19,380
coming that we'll announce soon

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,900
specifically here how go through these

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,490
you know I think the obvious question is

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,120
why we joined and I think the answer is

00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:30,130
fairly obvious we believe strongly that

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,830
developers need an open cloud neutral

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,850
and community driven native technology

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:39,280
sack container native avoiding cloud

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,970
lock in enabling hybrid mode between

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,240
cloud and on-premise lis that gives that

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,250
technical business flexibility that you

00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,560
guys are looking for so we've been

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,250
embracing this for a while

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,959
CNC F is clearly the main hub for that

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,990
kubernetes is kind of an anchor of some

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,780
of the work we're doing and a bunch of

00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:07,750
the other technologies as well coming

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:10,690
soon so today specifically we're

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,420
announcing two products or two releases

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,790
the first of which is the kubernetes

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,640
install assist terraform scripts for

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,410
Oracle's cloud infrastructure or what

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,430
we've been calling bare metal clouds now

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,390
rebranded as Oracle cloud infrastructure

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,480
fairly self-explanatory

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,130
it's terraform scripts that

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:35,220
create highly available kubernetes

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:37,830
control planes clusters etc on bare

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,260
metal so for existing customers easy way

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:44,330
to get up and running with kubernetes on

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:47,900
oracle on bare metal cloud secondly

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:51,990
announcing kubernetes on oracle linux

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:54,150
public ah for public private cloud and

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,510
on-premise oh you know customers running

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,540
oracle linux kubernetes trivial

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:03,150
installation freely available to

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,940
download and specifically we give

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,120
premier support when you deploy it on

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,690
our cloud infrastructure most of these

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,890
are just teasers though you know we've

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,480
been active in a bunch of these

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,430
communities those of you have been in

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,280
the working groups have seen us start to

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,870
show up were we have a lot of

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,630
contributions in the pipe around

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,340
security around federation networking

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,920
conformance i was in the working group

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,350
for that yesterday under kubernetes as

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,480
many of you guys know we have our big

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,970
conference coming up in three weeks the

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,650
beginning of october so look for some

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,080
major announcements at Oracle OpenWorld

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,620
at JavaOne

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,540
we'll also be at cube con as sponsors so

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,050
we're very happy to be part of this

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,960
community it's not just kubernetes for

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,600
us my group is also leveraging a bunch

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,850
of other technologies prometheus open

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,840
tracing g RPC and some of the things

00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,750
that are gonna get announced right after

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,760
this so happy to be part of the

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,980
community obviously if you guys have

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,290
questions follow up with me afterwards

00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,290
and I'll hand it back to Chris

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:23,050
thank you John all right thank you so

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,790
you know for those are they're counting

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,860
now with Oracle part of Singh's

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,360
officially that is the top six you know

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,150
leading public cloud providers in the

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,570
world so members are greats but really

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:37,030
the lifeblood of C&C F are its projects

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:40,030
so and honestly my favorite part of of

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:42,940
CN CF so currently today we have ten

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:45,100
amazing projects in CN CF crew Manetti

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,110
is obviously you know our seed project

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,540
one of our most popular projects but we

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,100
have projects in the spaces of

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,800
monitoring with Prometheus tracing with

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,330
open tracing logging with fluent D

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,680
container D core container runtime

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,630
rocket and so on so we have a lot of

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,610
these awesome projects that we've kind

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:03,100
of mapped out and kind of brought into

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,930
CN CF over the last you know a couple

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,760
years and you know to me it's really

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,370
amazing to see how how things have grown

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,840
as I mentioned earlier two years ago not

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,660
many people really knew what you know

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,270
kubernetes is and the amount of adoption

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,890
that kubernetes has seen in the industry

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,419
in the last couple years is phenomenal

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,860
so I'd like to kind of you know point

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,570
out one crazy thing I don't know people

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,120
saw this it was like a couple weeks ago

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,430
I think was kubernetes where the source

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,979
code lives on github now github itself

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,180
is is you know running kubernetes so

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:33,130
it's like communities is like honestly

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,919
self-hosted on itself which to me is

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,870
like absolutely amazing so you know

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,710
they've also wrote a great blog post on

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,120
kind of how they're moving their

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,120
infrastructure and how they got there so

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,300
my high they recommend you taking Arita

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,360
that it's you know super super amazing

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,400
in my opinion another thing that we've

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,590
done is to you know you know one thing

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,350
with CN CF is you know we're all about

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,630
you know our our projects and and cloud

00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,800
native and we kind of have this

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,510
landscape diagram that you know people

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,330
who love or hates but you know I think

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,880
it's really important to show that there

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,820
are many aspects of cloud native there

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,040
are many ways I think to get to cloud

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,530
native for your company obviously we

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,390
think that CN CF projects are you know

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,970
battle-tested and generally well proven

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,900
but you know you know those are

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,460
essentially a set of recommendations

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
here's a guide on how you potentially

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,450
may get to cloud native with a list of

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,420
projects that are kind of sponsored and

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,180
blessed by CN CF

00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,650
but for you know those if you look a

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,140
little bit deeper in that in a diagram

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,540
there are sections in there where there

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,490
are you know potentially missing

00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,460
projects that Nestle aren't part of you

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,550
know CNC F so you know I'm happy to

00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,580
announce today that we're going to fill

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,620
the gap in some of these areas and we're

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,420
gonna hear from some you know new

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:57,550
projects in in a little bit so first to

00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:01,780
announce and I'd like to introduce the

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:05,000
Envoy project will be coming in to CN CF

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,590
it will be our eleventh project and to

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,400
learn a little bit more exactly about

00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:12,560
what envoy is I would like to invite

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,660
Chris Lambert on the stage the CTO of

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:21,740
lyft to tell us a little bit more so

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:25,100
thank you Chris thanks for having me

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,510
it's great to be here so I'm here to

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,950
talk about envoy but first I want to

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,590
talk a little bit about the origin story

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,850
for how we started development of envoy

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,810
and the problem that was solving for us

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,060
so going back to 2012 lyft was just a

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,560
small start-up a handful of Engineers

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,470
all working together on the same

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,940
codebase the same service and it was a

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,890
relatively straightforward system you

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,280
hit a button someone comes and picks you

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,310
up takes you wherever you want to go

00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:55,370
that worked great in 2012 but our growth

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,690
was it was pretty crazy both for the

00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,430
number of Engineers the number of rides

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,130
and the number of markets and we quickly

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,450
outgrew this single service model and

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,150
and started moving away from our

00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,350
monolith to a micro service architecture

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:09,080
and initially this worked out really

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,530
well but we started to run into some

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:15,050
pain points so 20 2012 we were doing a

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:17,840
few thousand rides a week 2017 we're now

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,670
doing over a million rides per day so

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,620
pretty massive growth and along with

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,110
that we've seen pretty massive growth in

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,240
our service infrastructure as well so

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,280
what started as one my car one service

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,900
where everything lived in the same

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,860
codebase and was deployed together is

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:36,650
now a set of 200 plus micro services all

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,070
communicating with each other over the

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,990
network

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,130
and one of the pain points that we

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,600
encountered

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,160
is that when something goes wrong it's

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,360
not obvious where the problem is it

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,040
could be the physical network the

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,990
virtual network could be your upstream

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,460
service downstream service and we spent

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,900
a fair amount of time trying to debug

00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,730
problems in the micro servers

00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,610
architecture without knowing where the

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,170
failure points were and we ended up in

00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,030
this scenario where there were certain

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,680
key pieces of functionality that we

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,090
wanted to keep in the monolith just

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,770
because we couldn't reliably trust the

00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,960
network as we started to move

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,120
functionality into these micro services

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,500
so that's obviously not ideal and pretty

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,260
prohibitive to what we were trying to do

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,080
so we set out to solve this problem but

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,400
it wasn't it wasn't straightforward and

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,870
we looked at the open source community

00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,310
and said what what are the options out

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,830
there that could work for us and we

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,420
didn't really see a great fit one of the

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,850
things that that's unique is that when

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,140
you hit set pickup and request a ride

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,400
and go through that process you're

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,440
actually talking to a hundred different

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,480
services under the hood all written in

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,670
different languages run by different

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,520
teams and we really wanted to have a

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:41,510
consistent set of metrics and and

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,000
reliability monitoring on all these

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,370
systems as we move things out of the

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,310
monolith so our fundamental guiding

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,020
philosophy as we set out to solve the

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,480
problem is that the network should be

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,890
transparent to applications we don't

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,180
want you to worry about what's happening

00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,950
in the network we want it to just work

00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,930
and if it doesn't we want to make it

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,720
really obvious to the developer where

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,220
the problem is so with that we built on

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,290
Vuli and this is a really lightweight

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,650
architecture diagram just to go through

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,930
how it works is we built Envoy as a side

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:13,730
car that sits alongside all of your

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,170
application servers so for us it's also

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,520
our front proxy that handles all

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,310
incoming connections from the mobile

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,870
clients but it also sits alongside every

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,060
upstream and downstream service and

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,000
handles all inter service communication

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,560
and what that does it gives us

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,800
incredible insight into how services are

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,590
performing and where problems are it's

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,970
also given us a powerful platform to

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,740
build on top of where it's not just

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,210
services service communication we've

00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,400
been able to instrument our data stores

00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,590
whether it's dynamo DB or MongoDB or

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,360
Redis using the same infrastructure to

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,460
give us the same insights on performance

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,530
which is pretty amazing so there's a lot

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,230
more to say about envoy but we started

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,780
work on it in 2015 and about a year ago

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,690
today we open sourced it

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,250
and it's pretty pretty amazing year we

00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,540
open-source it thinking you know maybe

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,100
we'll get some other startups excited

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,980
about it and and they'll help us kind of

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,830
maintain the project and within a year

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,150
we've seen some pretty massive adoption

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,130
everyone here is actively using or

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,750
contributing to envoy and we now have

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,580
more people at companies like Google

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,870
that are actively developing envoy then

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,990
we do in-house at lyft

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,640
so pretty amazing and and definitely not

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,830
something we take for granted but we've

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,900
realized that envoy is now this is much

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,580
bigger than lyft and it's it's a there's

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,350
a lot at stake here so we're really

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,900
excited to announce our donation to CN

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,760
CF today to make envoy part of this

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,850
community and and to really help move

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,950
the industry forward so really excited

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,020
to make that official and excited for

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,330
all the support that CN CF has given us

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,190
to date and really looking forward to to

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,020
partnership with with our pure projects

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,660
over the next few years

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,470
one last thing I'll leave you with is

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,130
honourably has been really instrumental

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,500
in our work on the cloud to date but we

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,060
have big plans at lyft we've just

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,400
started a new level five engineering

00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,920
center focused on a autonomous vehicle

00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,810
development in Palo Alto on boys already

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,520
proven pretty pretty helpful there and

00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,930
we've got big plans so if that's

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,700
interesting to you definitely come talk

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,430
to us we'd love to have your help and

00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,470
we're hiring all across the country so

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:23,600
thanks again for having me and look

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:25,910
forward to the next few years awesome

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,610
thank you Chris super exciting I'm a

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,930
huge fan of on voice so I mentioned that

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,720
you know we're gonna have a couple

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,360
projects so first we had envoy come up

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,200
and well we have another major

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,020
announcement today so I would like to

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,300
announce that we have a another project

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:48,260
coming it's the ncf called Jaeger has a

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,640
very cute logo I'm a huge little fan of

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,100
that logo we'll see how that looks on

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:56,060
the CN CF website but I would like to

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,480
have URI form uber to come up on stage

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,930
and talk a little bit about Jaeger and

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,280
what it's all about

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:10,720
so please welcome URI Charcot from uber

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,720
[Applause]

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:18,900
hello everyone

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:24,030
thank you for having me I'm very excited

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:26,160
to present Jaeger so I'm a staff

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,230
engineer at uber I've been there about

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,880
two years and that's about the time when

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:35,910
we started Jaeger and my story will be

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,490
somewhat very similar to what lift head

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,770
in terms of how that project came to be

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,050
it just saw a slightly different problem

00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:46,770
but I came from the same kind of

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:51,180
backgrounds so as you probably all know

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:52,050
uber has seen insane growth in the past

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,660
few years

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:59,960
and I remember just like not long ago we

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,870
we've hit a milestone of 1 billion

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,780
completed trips on over and a few months

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,510
ago we hit 5 billion and then we like

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,580
heading towards 10 billion trips so with

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,470
all that growth and it's not just trip

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,930
there are other business lines obviously

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,160
like uber eats for food delivery rush

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,460
for package delivery

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,110
so all that caused us to build like a

00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,390
lot of new features in the system and

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,340
create a lot of complexity in the system

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:29,520
and at the same time we needed that

00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,920
system to be scalable to be reliable and

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,650
we needed to keep the developer velocity

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,510
up so fortunately containers and micro

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,570
services were invented and our

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,270
engineering kind of embrace that

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:45,780
paradigm and we moved into that space

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:49,200
and as a result today

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,920
uber architecture contains like several

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,930
thousand micro services so this is just

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,520
kind of a segment of the dependency

00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:03,000
graph that's generated by jäger so every

00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,850
time you take a trip seem like you've

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,709
seen on a lyft slide where like you take

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:10,020
a ride but even actually when you're on

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:11,760
the write the application always talks

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,230
to the backend like every few seconds

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,480
there is something communication going

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,010
on and there a transaction happening

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,470
across a whole bunch of micro services

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,679
whether

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,230
to get a new root update new ETA may be

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,939
picking up another rider on the pool so

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,179
all those transactions hitting a whole

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:31,150
bunch of different services and in order

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,710
to maintain the complexity of that

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,140
system and that happened in like

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,059
billions of times a day right so to keep

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:42,429
that system working we have to monitor

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:44,590
it in a very robust way and at uber when

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,150
when we started doing like very

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,470
intensive monitoring we had to build our

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,080
own metric system because there's

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:54,280
nothing on open-source or in commercial

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,200
that could scale but metrics they're

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,760
great for monitoring but like if you

00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,000
think about metrics like every one of

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,470
those nodes in in the diagram is is kind

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,210
of that's what metrics tell you they're

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:07,659
just like small little story about one

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,010
single note in in architecture they

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:10,150
don't tell you the whole picture of they

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,350
don't tell anything about the

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,900
transaction happening across the

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,700
architecture and that's where Jaeger

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,460
comes in Jaeger is a distributed tracing

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,970
system which essentially traces

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,830
transactions and it allows us to solve

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,280
other problems as well so when something

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:29,289
goes wrong we can look at traces and

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,690
deep dive like follow the path of the

00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,460
transaction and and so usually find the

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,159
root cause of what's wrong with with a

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,620
particular request or if things are slow

00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:41,409
then you can also like analyze critical

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,510
paths and find out why things are slow

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:45,000
sometimes the system can just point you

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,530
to the root cause it directly

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,140
this service dependency diagram that I

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,580
showed before that's very useful for

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,409
developers to even understand what this

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,690
whole architecture is doing like no one

00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:57,400
can keep in their mind like several

00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,650
thousand micro services and all their

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:04,150
interactions what they're doing so it's

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:05,320
very important but on all of those

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,690
functions they're actually made

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,080
available by the generic context

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,380
propagation layer that client Jaeger

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,510
libraries provide and this is a feature

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,909
that has been like in tracing always but

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,890
somewhere in the background we brought

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:25,870
it on top of we built a lot efficient of

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:28,030
that so a bit of a history Jaeger as the

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,340
system was inspired by Google's dapper

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:32,770
paper and open Zipkin

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,780
which came out of Twitter we started

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,780
about two years ago and we open sources

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:41,890
in in spring so it's a fairly young

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,660
project we built it with open tracing

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,270
support from the beginning were actually

00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:51,130
one of the founding members of the open

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:54,280
tracing another CNC of project and in

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:57,160
terms of technology we it's it's like we

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,290
go shop in New York City so most of our

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,290
back end in Jaeger is written and go

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,400
we support pluggable storage so we

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,680
implemented Cassandra in elasticsearch

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,210
backends but we're working on other ones

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,310
if you'd like people interested in some

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:14,170
like influx DB and maybe other backends

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:17,290
react front-end the instrumentation

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,030
libraries are really what most of the

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,880
people are exposed to because that goes

00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:23,620
into your applications and open tracing

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,120
is the standard which we embraced early

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:30,510
on our community has been growing since

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,620
since open-source we were likely to get

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,900
partners in Red Hat

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,450
they've been contributing a lot of

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,700
features already to Jaeger and between

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,440
us and the Red Hat we have full 10 like

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,350
10 full-time developers working on

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,880
Jaeger on all the time and we have a

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,830
number of contributors don't get cut

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,420
from other companies as well as many

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:54,310
other companies already using Jaeger

00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:57,510
today this is a screen shot of jäger

00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,980
front end it shows you kind of the

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:02,170
sample trace you on the left you see the

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,570
hierarchy of the calls the call graph

00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,600
the time sequence diagram at the bottom

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,810
is like one of the segments shows what

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,370
what details about this particular

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,900
service or particular creation within

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,020
the services doing this is kind of the

00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,090
things that help you root cause analysis

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:22,480
by drilling down into the execution of

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:26,130
the transactions across the stack so at

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,950
uber Jaeger has been integrated with

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,960
over a thousand services today we use it

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,640
for obvious features of tracing like

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,770
root cause analysis and dependency

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,780
analysis but we also as I mentioned

00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,760
build a lot of functionality on just a

00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,060
general context propagation facility

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,640
provided by Jaeger and we also

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:48,640
focusing a lot on the data mining part

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,320
of of actually getting insight from

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,090
tracing data in aggregate rather than

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,980
just looking at individual traces

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,780
because that really tells you a lot

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,060
about how your architecture is behaving

00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,810
when it's a when you have so many

00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,250
services the roadmap for Jaeger is you

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,220
can find it online I'm not going to go

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,110
through that some of these things

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:12,550
already in progress some will be coming

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:14,350
up and we welcome help and other

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,410
suggestions that people want to see in

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:21,760
our project and definitely very exciting

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:24,100
to join CN CF CN CF mission is kind of

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,200
to provide a set of standard tools for

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,060
people deploying cloud infrastructures

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,730
and we want eager to become one of those

00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,400
standard tools I firmly believe that in

00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:36,370
any microservices moderately complex

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,110
micro-services architecture you cannot

00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,550
survive without distributed tracing you

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,370
simply don't have the visibility into

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:45,100
what your application is doing and we

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,780
are also looking forward to integrating

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,540
with other cnc of projects we already

00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:52,630
can run on kubernetes we we get traces

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,580
from invoice we we can send metrics to

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,010
Prometheus but we're looking for more

00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,770
integrations as well and as I mentioned

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,990
all contributions are welcome and we

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:04,690
were still growing our engineering team

00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,580
in New York is happy to to see more

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,470
people so if you're interested in what

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:14,989
we are doing come talk to me thank you

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,989
[Applause]

00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:22,630
all right thank thank you URI

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,990
distributed tracing is is amazing and to

00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,210
me it's really great to now have 12

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:31,150
projects as part of the ciencia family

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,610
so just live right now we went back and

00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:37,240
updated that wonderful landscape diagram

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,770
so now you have envoy Jaeger part of

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,830
that so you know I'm so glad to have

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,630
these projects you know part of CN CF I

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,940
love all of our projects equally I've

00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:49,150
actually been taking an uber and lyft on

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,700
a rotating basis all all week so it's

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,830
been a it's been great to have these two

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,450
projects involved with us so you know

00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,890
I'll want to kind of basically end

00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,409
things off is that we have a

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,909
big conference coming up in Austin in

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:02,320
December which is my hometown which is

00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:04,390
great it's great not to actually travel

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,950
for an event whoo

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,679
so hopefully some of you could actually

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,299
come to Austin attend clown native

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,070
Connick cube con and come learn a little

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,470
bit more about the different CN CF

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,059
projects we have out there and come meet

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,769
and learn about the future of

00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,260
essentially cloud infrastructure so

00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:22,779
thank you very much for your time and

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,860
I'm going to hand it back to jimta to

00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,940
kind of move us forward over through the

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:31,859
day so thank you very much

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:31,859
