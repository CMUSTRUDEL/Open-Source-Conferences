Description: 
	Keynote: Partnered Leadership - Bindi Belanger, Executive Program Director, Ticketmaster

Historically, there has been an industry-wide challenge in turning talented engineers into leadership “unicorns” (i.e. those who excel in vision setting, strategic planning, technology mastery, employee mentorship and motivation, team organization, project execution, communication and all other things that leaders should be). In her talk, Bindi will share her experiences at Ticketmaster and how “partnered leadership” has allowed the technology organization to enable strong functional leaders to drive innovation and increase speed to delivery while allowing each leader to focus on developing their unique talents.

thank you Jim and thanks to everyone for

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:07,170
joining me here this morning my name is

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,929
bindi Boulanger and I'm an executive

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,670
program director at Ticketmaster I've

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,490
been with Live Nation and Ticketmaster

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,560
for a little over four years and in that

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,770
time my role has evolved quite a bit

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,630
today I partner with our leaders in the

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,939
platform and Technical Operations teams

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,789
to facilitate strategic planning

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,250
resource alignment and project delivery

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,380
in other words I help the leaders figure

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,480
out what we should be working on how do

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,430
we organize ourselves effectively to

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,950
work on that stuff and then to

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,410
ultimately help ensure a successful

00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:43,170
execution a little bit about

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,539
Ticketmaster it's actually a 40 year old

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,510
company which means we have lots of

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,600
really fun legacy challenges to work on

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,160
in 2010 we partnered with Live Nation to

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,559
join forces to power live experiences so

00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,140
until recently we've sold over 565

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,430
million tickets to events at 37

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,610
different countries across the globe

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:09,510
which means we've been able to help fans

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,360
of over 539 million in number get to see

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,280
the live experiences they want to see

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,409
last year we did about 25 billion

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,759
dollars in gross transaction value which

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,189
is basically the value of all the

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,490
tickets that we sold so that makes us a

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,439
top 5 ecommerce website but the best

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,740
thing about working at Ticketmaster and

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,689
libation is that we get to power

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,790
unforgettable moments of joy somewhere

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,400
in the world every 20 minutes is a Live

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,500
Nation event it's pretty cool to know

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,150
that we're basically in the business of

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,500
selling fun and great memories so you

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,899
might be wondering why someone from

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,270
Ticketmaster is here speaking at an open

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,560
source summit well open source is in our

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,939
DNA with over 5,000 physical servers

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,100
22,000 virtual machines and ec2

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,369
instances basically a really large

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,860
footprint 95% of that runs on Linux and

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,990
other open source software our biggest

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,619
projects these days are on kubernetes

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,440
terraform Prometheus gitlab and read it

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,330
we are heavy nodejs users graph on a

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,549
Python etc

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,470
most recently last year we joined the

00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:19,330
cloud native computing Foundation as an

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,620
enterprise member and recent

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,959
contributions to the open-source

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,670
community include the tech maturity

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,799
model that we open sourced about four

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,079
months ago which is a model that helps

00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:30,940
software engineering teams measure their

00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,680
maturity and a number of different

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,870
software development capabilities and

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,700
then just a couple of months ago we

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,980
worked with core OS to build and release

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,750
and alb ingress controller for

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,540
kubernetes which is something that we

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,489
needed to be able to run large workloads

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,109
on Prem with kubernetes and wanted to

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:50,260
make sure was available to the rest of

00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:51,819
the community as well but today I'm here

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,760
to talk a little bit about partner

00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:56,769
leadership we've all heard the saying

00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,319
that two heads are better than one and

00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:01,299
we definitely see that applied on our

00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,030
engineering teams when you think of like

00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:06,810
paired programming but we don't often

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,180
apply that idiom to leadership

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,680
traditionally we see leadership as a

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,989
hierarchy where one person sets the path

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,319
and direction for his or her team an

00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:19,150
alpha wolf of the pack so to speak you

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,430
rarely see two people in charge of a

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,000
single team right and I think we do that

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,129
to ensure singular accountability but by

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,730
doing so we also expect that our leaders

00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:32,859
excel at everything so the best leader

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,069
ever would be someone who's able to

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:38,410
define a vision where are we going to

00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:41,799
also come up with the strategy how will

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,840
we get there to be able to successfully

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,269
execute and figure out how to organize

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,090
the team to accomplish the goals that

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,889
they've set we want them to be really

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,780
good at motivating people so that our

00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,599
teams go above and beyond on every

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,940
single project we also want them to be

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,650
able to empower other leaders so that

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,329
they can delegate but still make sure

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,329
that their overarching vision is

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:06,819
achieved we need them to be able to

00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:08,620
prove their success what metrics and

00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:10,810
measures are they using to know that

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,419
they're delivering on time on budget and

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,459
hitting their business targets we want

00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,699
them to be able to manage well during

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:21,519
wartime and peacetime and we've defined

00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:23,469
war as everything is on fire we need to

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,150
be able to mobilize teams to move fast

00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:27,729
meet deadlines prevent

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,120
disaster but regardless of cost or

00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:32,889
temporary impact to team morale that

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,889
same leaders should also be able to

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,870
manage well in peacetime to be able to

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,060
plan thoughtfully so that we can deliver

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,050
the highest quality products deliver

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,270
within budget

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,419
all the while creating meaningful career

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,100
paths for everybody on the team we want

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,259
them to be able to create a really

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,270
meaningful culture to be able to pull

00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,910
all of the above together in order to

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,860
keep and attract top talent while making

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,260
sure that Wall Street is happy every day

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,949
and every quarter we want our leaders to

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:06,430
be all the things in other words what I

00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:08,590
call a tech leadership unicorn now trust

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,270
me when I say that unicorns do exist and

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,150
I'm sure we've got several here in the

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,350
audience today but these are not easy

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,570
people to find

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,449
I mean combining tech wizardry and

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,030
rainbows is not something you can put in

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:24,009
a job description right but the truth is

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,789
that leader leadership unicorns are not

00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:29,500
born we have to grow them leaders who

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:31,840
eventually become masters at all these

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,280
different skills typically do so because

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,880
they've learned from experience and

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,199
mentors and other examples along the way

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,330
many leaders are fortunate enough to

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,979
have those examples and to be able to

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,949
pick up certain skills from other

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:47,380
dynamic leadership styles over several

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:49,960
years but we don't always have that kind

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,300
of time in tech we need leaders who can

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,550
cover all of those bases now so that we

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,409
can rapidly develop new software and new

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,389
technologies at the pace that our

00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:03,099
customers and in the case of the open

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:04,599
source community our peers need it so

00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:06,449
what's the answer when we can't find

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:09,669
leaders who excel at everything

00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:13,030
one solution is partnered leadership

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:15,580
it's not a new concept in fact we see it

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,620
everywhere in sports we see it with

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,780
general managers and coaches in

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,580
education we sometimes see it with two

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,800
vice principals who will split up the

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,800
role and take different responsibilities

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,990
to get the job done and most notably in

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,550
the business world we see it with our C

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,010
suite where each of the senior

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,479
executives is responsible for ultimately

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,690
ensuring the success of their business

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,830
area but what does partnered leadership

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,380
look like in the text

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,360
face let me start by giving you a few

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,490
examples of leaders who don't

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,880
necessarily have every single one of

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,920
their unicorn leadership traits first

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,960
we've got a really strong technical

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,150
leader who either doesn't have the

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,250
interest or the experience in managing

00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,930
people now this could be a personal

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,640
preference or it could just be that they

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,040
didn't have the training or the

00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,450
experience that they needed

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,550
unfortunately what we see a lot here is

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,710
that people continue to grow in Excel as

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,020
a technologist and then we try to force

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,030
them to be managers sometimes that works

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,880
and you you create a unicorn and

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,320
sometimes it doesn't the flip side of

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,980
that coin is that you have a great

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,350
people leader who is great motivating

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,270
teams and organizing people but doesn't

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,430
necessarily have the technology skills

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,370
or expertise to be able to drive a

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,560
project on their own we've also got the

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,940
leader who's got great vision knows

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,710
where they want to take the team or

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,980
company but they couldn't put a plan

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,470
together to save their life you've got

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,660
the excellent planner and organizer who

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,640
often gets buried in the details and

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,980
fails to take a step back and look at

00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,570
the bigger picture and then of course

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,390
there is the leader who is the

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,730
perfectionist engineer but unfortunately

00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,000
continues to miss deadlines because they

00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,980
refuse to work on what we always refer

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,600
to as MVP and they want to make sure

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,340
it's perfect and that every single

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,910
feature that they think is important is

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,560
included in that first release but

00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,000
instead of seeing people's limitations

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,070
we should be looking for opportunities

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,500
to pair people up so that their

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:18,400
strengths combined allow them to form a

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,650
great leadership team for example we had

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,360
a strong senior architect who is an

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,100
amazing problem solver and believed

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,990
strongly that they designed the right

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,970
solution but is having trouble getting

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,580
buy-in from the rest of the engineering

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,990
team on their approach if you were to

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,240
partner them with the strong people

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,250
manager who excels at facilitating

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,320
collaborative working sessions who's

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,790
really good at negotiations who can

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,650
engage the team to ask the right

00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,300
questions and then contribute their

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,160
suggestions to the overall final

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,580
solution we've got a great partnership

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,320
here or in the case where you have a

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,040
strong visionary who knows what the

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,199
endgame should look like but does

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,060
really know how or where to kick things

00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:58,339
off if you partner them with a

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,380
detail-oriented planner who will be able

00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,870
to ask great questions and help break

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,639
the work down create a step-by-step plan

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,620
and then figure out what skill sets are

00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,870
required in order to get the job done

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,290
you're much more likely to accomplish

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,930
that vision and in the case of the

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,389
leader who is consistently delivering

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,190
high quality code with their team but

00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,170
refuses to push anything to production

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,149
until it's absolutely complete and

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,980
perfect if you partner them with a

00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,690
little bit more of a faster pace leader

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,240
who's good at breaking down the work

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,490
into smaller iterations but also in

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,920
defining a great process or Quality

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,069
Assurance is is highlighted that's

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,660
another great partnership so you might

00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:39,560
think that some of this sounds pretty

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,209
obvious right

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,430
so what stops us from doing this

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:46,940
everywhere and I think the answer to

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,709
that is accountability if you put two

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,839
people in charge of something or even

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:52,149
three what happens when the other person

00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,410
doesn't hold up their end of the bargain

00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:56,209
does the other partner just point the

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,560
finger of blame and say well I had the

00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,019
vision and you couldn't come up with a

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,860
good tech solution or I came up with the

00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:05,540
plan and you didn't motivate the team

00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,040
one way to address this is to be very

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,310
clear in defining roles and

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,410
responsibilities in the example I've got

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,389
here up on this screen you might have

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,310
someone called the general manager which

00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:18,620
is a role that we've been using more and

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,839
more at ticketmaster that person would

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,300
be accountable for defining mission and

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,040
success criteria and ultimately ensuring

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,199
that the project was successfully

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,910
delivered partner them with the great

00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,399
product leader who's really good at

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,079
understanding what the users need

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,660
writing user stories and acceptance

00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,610
criteria add in a really strong tech

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,310
leader who is ultimately accountable for

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,779
the final design architecture and then

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,480
making sure we've got the right

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:46,579
engineers to build quality software add

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,350
a programme leader who will be

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,240
responsible for planning and organizing

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,980
delivery and then make sure that the

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,199
engineering managers those people

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,670
managers are available and accountable

00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:58,100
to making sure that the engineering

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:01,639
teams have the skills coaching and

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,350
training that they need so here's an

00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,430
example of where partnered leadership

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,020
might be beneficial

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,420
let's say you need to solve a technical

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,250
problem and get buy-in from end-users if

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,490
you had a single leader that might have

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,350
been a tech person that didn't

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,540
necessarily have the strong engagement

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,430
skills in order to make sure that they

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,870
were building the right thing you might

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,390
be setting yourself up for a failure

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:26,340
instead if you create a partner

00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,260
leadership team or you have a product

00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,720
lead who is ultimately accountable for

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,600
the full delivery working with a program

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,760
lead to get feedback from users and

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,770
facilitate those sessions define the

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,390
access criteria and then add the tech

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,490
lead to design and oversee the

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,530
implementation of a technical solution

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:47,010
you've got much more of your bases

00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,870
covered there another example is if your

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,600
company was trying to kick off a large

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,700
new business initiative if you had as

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,740
general manager without really strong

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,240
planning skills or maybe because they've

00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,130
been in a leadership position for so

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,680
long is a little bit disconnected from

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,320
the technology they may be able to

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,510
define a big long term vision but unable

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,580
to figure out what the details are in

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,860
order to get that work done if you

00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,230
partner them with the program lead to

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,880
break that work down into milestones in

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,830
a tech leave that can help figure out

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,690
how to iteratively deliver on that

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,230
solution you're much more likely to

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,330
accomplish that vision so when does this

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,880
work well this works really well I think

00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,950
at large companies or enterprises where

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,660
you have a big talent base of functional

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,090
leaders or people that are really strong

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:35,070
in their specific area where you have a

00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,900
wide variety of skill sets to work with

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,730
and you have an organization that

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,360
embraces change and is willing to

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,930
consider trying this new style out if

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,730
you don't have that the alternatives are

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,590
investing in training investing in

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,680
coaching or developing a mentoring

00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,150
program in order to bring in either

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,160
external talent or leverage leaders in

00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,020
other parts of your business to help and

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,680
of course there's always the option to

00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:03,840
hire the talent that you need so when

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,190
putting together successful partnerships

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,920
there's just a couple things I want to

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,630
call out on this slide first is that as

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,640
a senior leader it's really important

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,710
for you to know what your functional

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,900
leaders areas of strengths and

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,760
weaknesses are but also how they might

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,240
harmonize or clash with the other

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,899
leaders

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,730
your team that is super important also

00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:25,709
when you put your teams together you

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,330
need to create time and space for them

00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:29,940
to develop develop strong working

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,500
relationships and then also know that

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,839
you should be able to dynamically adjust

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,360
those partnerships when you need them so

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,430
for example if you're focusing at the

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,410
early start of a project on creating a

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,270
product roadmap you might want to put

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,670
together a product and a program lead

00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:47,640
but later let's say you found a major

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,589
issue in production it would be a good

00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,790
idea to partner your tech lead with

00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,529
someone who is really strong with

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,920
communication to both internal and

00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:58,589
external audiences and then being a

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,270
partner on a leadership team obviously

00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,860
knowing your strengths and weaknesses

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,930
and how you can leverage other people's

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,089
strengths where you may be falling a

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,890
little bit short but also knowing that

00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,860
your contributions on project by project

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:13,620
may vary so in some cases you may be

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,360
adding the value of creating and

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,370
defining the vision in other cases you

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,910
may may be more responsible for

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,610
motivating team members some of the

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,320
benefits of doing a partner leadership

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,779
approach are that you can maintain

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,899
singularly a singular accountability

00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:33,180
while sharing responsibility but also it

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,220
allows leaders to work together and be

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,680
able to have the opportunity to pick up

00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,810
the skill sets of other people this is

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,260
ultimately a way that you can start

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:45,390
developing your unicorn leaders at

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,130
ticketmaster we've got a couple we've

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,010
got actually partnered leadership across

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:52,740
the company on the left-hand side is

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:55,140
myself and my partner's Craig Amador and

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,910
Justin Dean and on the right-hand side

00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,480
we've got our fan experience senior

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,970
leadership team the picture of us is in

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,589
Quebec earlier this year if you're

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,240
looking for team-building activities

00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:06,570
surviving a blizzard is a really good

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,560
one

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:12,510
I recommend it so in closing I'd like to

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,459
say that while partnered leadership is

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,870
not a new concept I hope that my

00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,490
thoughts on the subject will have given

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,589
you a new or at least a different

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,630
perspective on how you might evaluate

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,480
leadership and leadership development in

00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:27,150
your organization so before I go I just

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,089
want to say that we'd like you to join

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,230
us tonight at the all attendee party

00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:33,690
Ticketmaster being in the business

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,280
powering live events of course needed to

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,680
bring in a live band for the party so

00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,470
we're excited about that and we are

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,600
hiring so if you have any questions

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,960
about what we do at Ticketmaster about

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,880
our kubernetes projects stop by the core

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,570
OS booth and we will be happy to chat

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:55,779
with you thank you

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,779
