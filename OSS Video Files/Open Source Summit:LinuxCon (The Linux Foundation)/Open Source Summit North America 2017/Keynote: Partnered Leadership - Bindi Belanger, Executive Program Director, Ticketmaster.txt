	Keynote: Partnered Leadership - Bindi Belanger, Executive Program Director, Ticketmaster

Historically, there has been an industry-wide challenge in turning talented engineers into leadership “unicorns” (i.e. those who excel in vision setting, strategic planning, technology mastery, employee mentorship and motivation, team organization, project execution, communication and all other things that leaders should be). In her talk, Bindi will share her experiences at Ticketmaster and how “partnered leadership” has allowed the technology organization to enable strong functional leaders to drive innovation and increase speed to delivery while allowing each leader to focus on developing their unique talents.
