I'm going to just kick off the event by

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,099
talking a few minutes about open source

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:12,330
in 2017 and it's been a pretty

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:15,389
incredible year and open source and you

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,369
know things just keep getting better and

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,970
today I thought I would talk to everyone

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,430
about just how open source isn't growing

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,070
it's actually accelerating exponentially

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,680
in terms of its influence in technology

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,990
and in society and and these numbers are

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,260
just amazing there are 23 million

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,860
open-source developers worldwide I think

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,079
they're like 22 million Republic

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,950
accounts on github 64 million

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,649
repositories 41 million lines of code

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,149
eleven hundred new projects every single

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,280
day and then there are 10,000 new

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,460
versions of different open source

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,100
projects every single day it's pretty

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,530
amazing just the growth and the sheer

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,559
number of developers and projects in

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:05,700
open source and even within individual

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,400
projects speed is accelerating in other

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,710
words the pace of development not just

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,770
the number of projects is accelerating

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,780
Linux is the best example of this Gregg

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,000
Crowe Hartman who works on the Linux

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,880
kernel gave me these numbers as a

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,850
refresh today we have 4300 developers

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,409
changing 10,000 line are adding 10

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,490
thousand lines of code a day modifying

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,619
2000 removing 2500 think about that a

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,360
code base that changes eight and a half

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,280
times an hour I mean it's just

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,189
self-evident that at this point no

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,350
single organization no single person

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,340
could ever keep up with a development

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,250
pace that fast that robust you know

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,380
what's interesting about Linux and I

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,140
think this is probably a precursor to

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,890
other trends that we're seeing in the

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,350
industry is that every market that Linux

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,509
has entered which is somewhat unusual

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,520
for an operating system where technology

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,500
sort of lead from one sector of

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,689
computing to another but every market

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,649
it's entered it hasn't just done well

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:12,480
it's come to completely dominate and you

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,650
know Gregg reminded me yesterday it's

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,829
not only come to dominate

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,599
but nobody had to use it right that you

00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,980
know it's it's totally free and it's a

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,599
voluntary thing for people to use but

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,569
just look at these numbers it pretty

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,750
much is the entire supercomputing market

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:29,579
almost all mainframes run Linux 90% all

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,079
of public cloud workloads out there are

00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:34,290
Linux embedded systems it's a majority

00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:38,280
market share I mean it's incredible to

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:42,390
see this some new numbers from just in

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:46,470
2017 with Android which of course runs

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,049
with Linux is 82% of the mobile device

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,170
world so in mobile Linux absolutely

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:54,959
dominates this year for the first time

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,359
Linux has exceeded Unix in the

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
enterprise server market now is sort of

00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:02,280
just behind the Windows Server in the

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,430
sort of on-prem enterprise server market

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,069
according to IDC 9 out of the top 10

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,139
public clouds run Linux but this was the

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,079
number this last number here is the one

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:17,159
I was most excited about in March of

00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:20,250
this year it largely due to Android but

00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:23,220
Linux based clients became the majority

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,910
of clients on the internet store passing

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:30,379
Windows for the first time this year so

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,829
do you know what all you know that means

00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:38,879
2017 say it with me

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:43,190
the year of the Linux desktop we finally

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:47,129
made it it is official this is the year

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,169
that's right so it's just amazing and

00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,090
you know it's it's not just software

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,229
that's eating the world which is you

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,510
know something people say all the time

00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,220
how important software has become in all

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,049
of our lives this concept of digital

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,239
transformation but it's actually

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,500
open-source software that's eating the

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,650
world the software that's eating the

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,019
world really is open-source because

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,620
today nobody makes anything without

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,900
open-source it's just a fact of how

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,479
modern application development works you

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,320
know creating applications these days is

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,090
a lot like making a sandwich

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,950
this year source clear helped me with

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,570
this metaphor and I think it's a really

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,130
good one but if you think of the way

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,210
apps get developed today it'll show you

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,340
just how important

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,069
open sources so think of a building an

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,680
app like a code club sandwich right

00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,900
where you know for the the bread you

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,240
choose a framework now we're big fans of

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,580
node.js here at the Linux Foundation so

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,770
that might be a good framework for folks

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,930
to choose in fact it is one of the most

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,300
popular frameworks for developers to

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,789
work with to build any modern

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,440
application these days and so you choose

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:54,539
a framework and then you start writing

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,190
your code right and of course you're

00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,870
making an application for whatever you

00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,699
need and so there certainly is custom

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,320
code and that could be in some cases

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,900
provides Harriet could be open source

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,110
but you write your custom code right and

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,960
as you're writing it what you do is then

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,060
go to one of the hundreds of thousands

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,150
of packages whether it's NPM or other

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,740
repositories and you start using

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,659
libraries that you find there to solve

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,360
problems and there are hundreds of

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:22,800
thousands of examples of problems that

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,509
have already been solved that you don't

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,610
need to solve yourself as developer to

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:28,740
solve those problems and when you add up

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,199
just the lines of code that happened

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,870
through this process what you see is

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,479
open source code ends up being the vast

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,900
majority of the code that you actually

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,240
use to build a modern application that

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,789
10% is the important code because

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,440
developers understand what their

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,509
customers need or let their fellow

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,759
developers might need or whoever their

00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,919
users are and what they might need but

00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,940
the vast majority of code these days

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:59,789
really is open source an open source

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,320
really isn't slowing down anytime soon

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,800
remember I mentioned you know there

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,550
eleven hundred new libraries every

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,050
single day that that trend line is

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,520
accelerating and you know there are

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,460
predictions out there that we will have

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,009
hundreds of millions of libraries out

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,860
there that all of us will depend on to

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:22,979
build the technology of the future now

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,770
what that means to everyone is that we

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,919
have an abundance of code but with

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:32,070
abundance it's created I think a little

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,870
bit of anxiety right just does everybody

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,849
remember this book and was published

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,539
back in 2004 called the paradox of

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,249
choice right so the idea here was that

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,379
in the United States if you went

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,199
to any supermarket there would be you

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,839
know 60 different kinds of ketchup and

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,109
there would be a hundred different kinds

00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,699
of potato chips and having to choose

00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:56,669
between those different things actually

00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,429
created anxiety for people that people

00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,109
got he's sort of disturbed by all of

00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:03,449
this choice it was sort of paradoxical

00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:05,909
because everyone thought you more choice

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:08,099
is better but it actually made people

00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:10,409
less happy right and that's sort of the

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:12,809
thesis of the book and I'm probably not

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:15,629
doing justice to to the book but I think

00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:17,969
we have the same problem and certainly

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,439
developers have this problem where you

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:22,889
know am i choosing the right framework

00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:27,649
is that particular package secure or not

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:31,529
should I bet my future on go or

00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:33,029
JavaScript or in my Ruby person you know

00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,419
which which one's gonna be here in the

00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:35,519
future

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,769
you know if I bet my company's

00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:41,999
infrastructure on this platform versus

00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:44,279
that platform what does that mean and so

00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:46,319
the real question that we ask ourselves

00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,969
at the Linux foundation every day and I

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,069
think most people just naturally ask

00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,919
themselves is of those 64 million

00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:55,799
open-source projects out there which are

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,569
the ones that really really matter which

00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:58,919
are the ones that I can bet my future on

00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:00,479
which are the ones that are going to be

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,309
supported which are the ones that are

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,979
going to provide the security of the

00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:08,729
quality and the code base that really

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:10,709
meets my requirements and we think at

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,959
the Linux Foundation that the answer to

00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,299
that and you'll hear this more and more

00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,919
in the open source world this talk about

00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:18,389
sustainability we think the answer is

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,909
that projects with sustainable

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,360
ecosystems are the ones that really

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:23,699
matter

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,610
you see we're moving towards this future

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,439
where open source has this existence

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,819
proof that all of us are smarter than

00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,739
any one of us and that we can better

00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,959
others at the same time that we better

00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:36,149
ourselves it's sort of this form of

00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,829
almost collective capitalism is a good

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,839
way to think about it if you look at

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:42,120
this pattern where you have open source

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,800
projects you know linux as an example

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,990
90% of the developers there are

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,430
professional developers who work for

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,980
organizations that depend and rely on

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,529
linux every day those projects create

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,180
they're used in products you know

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,820
whether it's to run

00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,420
Google's cloud and search or power every

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,270
Kindle or power this galaxy gear device

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,339
that I have on my wrist here value is

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,750
then created from those products that

00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,700
value gets reinvested in the project

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:15,120
largely in the form of employing

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,060
developers to work at Samsung or Google

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,860
or Amazon to contribute to the Linux

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,870
kernel or any other open-source projects

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,940
which baguettes better code which

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,890
baguettes new products with better

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,899
features functionality performance

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,899
security and so forth which baguettes

00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,600
more value more reinvestment it is this

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,630
virtuous cycle that really is the

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,270
hallmark of sustainable open-source and

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,250
this is the future we're moving towards

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,500
again you can see how there's a

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,470
collective aspect and then there's sort

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,270
of an individual aspect and a profit

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,890
aspect of all of that and that's why it

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,110
sort of looks like some of this concepts

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,390
that you see in economic theory around

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:58,880
collective capitalism and so forth and

00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:01,500
so we are seeing a huge rise of this

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,570
positive feedback loop happening in open

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,360
source projects and just at the Linux

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,690
Foundation we are home to a whole bunch

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,520
of projects that are entering into this

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,980
positive feedback loop and it's not just

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,900
us it's organizations like the Eclipse

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,000
Foundation and the OpenStack foundation

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,730
the Apache Software Foundation who are

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,800
all hosting these projects that help in

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,839
and move the world and create these

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,029
sustainable ecosystems you know a few

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,770
examples here are let's encrypt project

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:30,950
this incredible project do you know that

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,640
there is now the world's largest

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:37,050
certificate authority is totally free

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,130
the let's encrypt project which we host

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,550
here at the Linux Foundation have the

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:45,720
privilege to host is was built under the

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:49,200
theory of we want TLS to be the default

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,940
for the internet that if all web traffic

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,160
is secure we will have more privacy

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,070
better security fewer man-in-the-middle

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,470
attacks and so forth and to make that

00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,720
happen you have to make the act of

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,540
getting a certificate very very easy and

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,029
as Euro cost today that project has

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,230
issued 50 million certificates and is

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:07,740
the world's largest certificate

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,500
authority

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,180
in networking we have a project called

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,700
the open network automation platform

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:21,270
that's transforming the networks of

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:24,660
China Mobile AT&T and about 55% of the

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,640
world's mobile operators that will

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,440
essentially allow them to automate their

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,800
networks through Sdn and NFV

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,110
and then move towards the world of 5g

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,300
where higher data speeds and more users

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,490
will be able will be accessing their

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,860
networks this is all in open source

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,350
think of that the world's largest

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,230
operators AT&T China Mobile have

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,240
partnered huge roubles and have open

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,820
sourced the infrastructure that they're

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,110
using to run their production networks

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,810
it's insane

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,260
in cloud has anybody ever heard of

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,330
kubernetes here anyone kubernetes is

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,250
amazing you know we call it the Linux of

00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,860
the cloud it's really this platform

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,510
that's becoming the portability layer

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,000
there the way that applications will get

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,730
deployed on private and across public

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,310
clouds we have the Cloud Foundry effort

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,720
here run by half the Fortune 500 the

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,670
cloud native computing foundation which

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,800
is of course home to kubernetes but

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,990
other projects such as prometheus and

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,860
many many more our automotive grade

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:29,040
Linux initiative is in production today

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,770
in the us's best-selling commercial

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,080
vehicle the Toyota Camry it will is

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:37,320
slated to be in production next year in

00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,690
tens of millions of vehicles worldwide

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,970
we have a blockchain initiative that's

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:45,300
being used to create a distributed

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:48,660
ledger that will help manage identity in

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,029
places like India get better financial

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,600
access to people who don't have the

00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,160
means

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,720
who are in poverty through using digital

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,240
currency initiatives will make

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,700
back-office financial processing much

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,910
much faster and allow our economies to

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,890
grow we have embedded in IOT initiatives

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,930
like the Yocto project Zephyr and our

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,370
edge X foundry that are building the

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,140
infrastructure for the edge of the

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,740
network that will handle the load of

00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:19,050
billions of devices all converging onto

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,089
a global network of connected things and

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,129
then finally we're home to know Jay

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:24,569
which is the world's largest server-side

00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,730
Java framework and one of the most

00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:29,309
popular development frameworks in the

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,470
world you see open-source is

00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,720
accelerating our organization

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,180
organizations like us continue to grow

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,459
there's over 800 organizations in our in

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,249
the Linux Foundation for 41 countries 80

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:44,129
percent of the Fortune 100 tech and

00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:45,990
telecom companies 25000 developers work

00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,850
on just Linux Foundation projects alone

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,100
across a hundred projects creating

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:53,069
nearly 16 billion dollars of shared

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:57,120
value investment is accelerating in open

00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:58,769
source between 2010 and 2015 investment

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,629
in open source startups venture just

00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,759
venture investment increased eight over

00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:04,589
eight fold just in Linux Foundation

00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,709
projects three billion dollars in

00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,689
venture investment has been allocated to

00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:12,269
projects that are companies that are

00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:15,569
based on CN CF projects a half a billion

00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:19,439
dollars in hyper ledger startups almost

00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:21,480
200 million in nodejs startups AT&T

00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:23,160
announced a 200 million dollar fund for

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,529
the open network automation platform I

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,529
think you all get the picture here that

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:30,300
it just continues to grow our events

00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,519
continue to grow as evident by all of

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,740
you here you may not know but we run a

00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,079
hundred 50 events in dozens of countries

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,670
with 25,000 developers every year

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,740
they're all over two and a half million

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,509
people in the meetup groups just for the

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,850
projects that the Linux Foundation hosts

00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:46,290
we provide a half a million dollars in

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,939
travel funding for people who don't have

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,399
the financial means to come to our

00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:53,279
events and we reinvest the money that we

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,920
make from these events back into the

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,730
communities that we serve

00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,540
so I think I've convinced you that

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,980
open-source is big but as many of you

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,209
for anyone who have ever worked for me

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,370
for and I've been doing this for a very

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,800
long time anyone's ever work with me

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,019
knows that I like to say the same thing

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,620
all the time to this statement here

00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:16,259
which is let's think bigger

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:18,420
let's do more this is such an important

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,149
concept this idea of collective work

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,559
this idea of a sustainable future for

00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:25,170
the greatest shared technology

00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,179
investment in history this is critical

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,129
and so today we're gonna announce a

00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:32,279
series of new initiatives that will help

00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:33,890
accelerate that sustainability loop that

00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,590
positive feedback loop

00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:40,220
in open source the first thing we want

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:43,340
is more participation more organizations

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:46,910
coming in and allowing their developers

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:50,000
to participate in open source you see

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,950
the biggest bottleneck to the growth of

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,070
Linux foundation projects or frankly any

00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,110
open source projects in many cases if

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,480
you think about that feedback loop where

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,250
you know industry is funding a lot of

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,100
developers some developers work

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,740
voluntarily but that feedback loop the

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,800
biggest bottleneck is organizations

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,800
don't know how to be a participant in

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,330
open source they just take the code they

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,690
make whatever they make and that's that

00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:20,030
if we can train organizations how to

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,300
move from consumers to allowing their

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,640
developers to participate to becoming

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,460
major contributors and then eventually

00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,200
leaders organizations that are actually

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,590
open sourcing code in order to share

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,200
that code with their fellow mankind we

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,900
will have significantly moved the needle

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,400
on the investment and most importantly

00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,320
the number of developers that are

00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,470
participating in these projects and so

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,790
to do that our to do group this is an

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,310
organization of open-source

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,980
professionals think of them as external

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,720
R&D managers the people who harvest the

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,390
billions of dollars of software

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,100
externally who help manage that 90% of

00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,260
the code that comes into their products

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,320
and services who help bring it into an

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,000
organization help their organization

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,820
modify that code to suit their needs and

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,830
then redistribute the changes they make

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,780
to that open-source code back out into

00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:14,180
the communities that is a business

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,520
process that is a legal process that is

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,650
a technical process it's something you

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,839
need to know and this group of

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,570
open-source program managers created a

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,690
guide that your organization can use to

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,640
understand those processes - I want to

00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,650
just highlight some of these folks and

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,500
thank them people like Ibrahim Haddad at

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,940
Samsung Sarah Novotny at Google will

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,680
Norris at Google Google in particular

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,450
they not only help with this guy but

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,730
they just open-source on their website

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,770
the entire methodology of how Google

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,970
works on open-source if you haven't seen

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,720
it go check it out it's just an

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:49,029
incredibly good read an incredibly help

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,000
Joe bata from heavy owe to name just a

00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:53,980
few all of these folks are at the top of

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,320
their game don't reinvent the wheel

00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,159
learn from them this will help us get

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,690
more developers into our world the

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,120
second thing we want to do to improve

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,679
the ecosystem and stability of open

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,990
source projects is to have better

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,850
project health

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,940
well when we started thinking about that

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,370
we asked of what does that even mean and

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,710
you know we went back to kind of a quote

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,950
who is kind of vaguely attributed to

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,710
Peter Drucker a management guru back in

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,970
the 70s and 80s but it's this idea if

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,730
you can't measure it you can't improve

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,379
it if you don't know what's going on

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,899
these communities it's going to be hard

00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:35,019
to change these communities and so we've

00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:36,879
created a project called chaos so

00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:39,549
community health analytics for open

00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:43,059
source software we love long acronyms

00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:45,730
and open source but you know it's it's

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,259
to answer these questions you know will

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,809
this project theÃ¡-- around what is their

00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:52,210
trajectory is there a diverse community

00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,529
here are the people participating from

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,659
different backgrounds and cultures

00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:57,549
because we already know that diverse

00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:59,080
communities are more effective

00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:00,759
communities that hasn't been proven by

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,250
open source that's just been proven in

00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,529
everything right but we want to know

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,559
what's going on so we can help improve

00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:10,929
those things and so a group of

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,299
organizations Red Hat butter Gia the

00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:16,120
Eclipse Foundation Lenora Mozilla open

00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:19,090
step and keep going here have gotten

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,480
together and are working on deciding

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:25,149
what are the right metrics how can we

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,759
then create tools that will allow

00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:30,370
projects to publish those metrics and

00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,740
track them on an ongoing basis

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,840
great work has already been done here

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,009
we're integrating a bunch of tools that

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,230
help check and track license provenance

00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:44,470
developer participation market adoption

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,269
and more Red Hat donated technology that

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,980
they had internally to the project the

00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:50,529
Linux Foundation has underwritten a

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,139
bunch of development for this there's

00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:55,299
been commercial companies that but like

00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:57,549
Peter Gia that have underwritten and

00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:59,860
open sourced a lot of code for this this

00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:00,519
is an incredible project go check it out

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,879
if we

00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,839
can't measure it we can't change it

00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:07,029
another thing we want to do to create

00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:11,739
healthy ecosystems is to create more

00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:14,889
secure code how many people have had

00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:18,399
security on their mind relative to the

00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:21,570
Internet these days a few can anyone

00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:23,080
guess what might have brought that up

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:27,489
that's right

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,959
I basically just entered and I think in

00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:29,440
the New York Times a reporter in the New

00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:32,109
York Times

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,119
entered Trump and six random numbers and

00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:36,940
this came up as well

00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,459
the reporters point was basically even

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,749
Equifax doesn't quite know every way

00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:42,339
they say everyone was effective they

00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:43,959
don't quite know who might have been

00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:45,759
affected that by this this may have

00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:49,269
changed in the last few days as Equifax

00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,159
tries to deal with essentially millions

00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:53,589
of people's confidential financial

00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,570
information being disclosed on the

00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:58,509
public Internet does anybody here happen

00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,419
to know what some of the reports are as

00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:03,039
to why this happened does anybody know

00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,849
who your reporters right here in the

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,029
front row

00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:09,099
but according to William Baird and

00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,079
company who wrote a report on the date

00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:14,829
of breach it was an open-source software

00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:18,609
package patchy struts that had a CVE

00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:21,459
that was one of the reasons that was the

00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:23,709
exploited essentially to a gaming system

00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:25,989
and let me tell you a patchy struts is a

00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:27,609
very well run project I mean they have a

00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:28,899
responsible disclosure policy they have

00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,759
a security mailing list these are folks

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:33,009
who pretty much know what they were

00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,679
doing you know these things happen over

00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:39,369
time but it just illustrates the fact

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:44,399
that we all depend on open source and we

00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:48,789
need to have a collective secure coding

00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:50,200
culture nobody can mandate all of the

00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:52,450
source developers need to take secure

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,919
coding classes all projects need to have

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,719
a hundred percent test coverage is all

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,609
projects needs to fuzz their code lint

00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:58,959
their code all projects need to have

00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,549
responsible disclosure policies all

00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,989
projects need to be able to do threat

00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:03,519
modeling for their code you can't

00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,869
mandate that because it's a problem

00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,249
Terry effort even if people are

00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,929
professionals working on these projects

00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:10,299
they're self forming organic communities

00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:11,889
so at the Linux Foundation a few years

00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:13,629
ago we created a project called the core

00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:14,530
infrastructure initiative and one of the

00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:15,910
ideas we

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,010
and some of the folks from that project

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:21,160
you're here today was to create a

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,640
badging program where projects could go

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:27,100
and prove that they care about security

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,750
and it was not security theater there

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,670
was a series of things you had to do to

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,800
improve the nature of secure coding in

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,210
your project to get the badge and the

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,640
idea is that the badge would indicate

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,550
you care and start creating a culture of

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,620
this lea says here the Linux kernel has

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,810
passed this program and we're happy to

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,120
announce today that over a hundred

00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,580
projects have been granted the CII best

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,920
practice badge we're really happy about

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,170
this milestone we're in particular happy

00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,200
because a lot of the leading projects

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,510
out there have passed this badging

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,580
process and those projects are an

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,070
example to the other thousand projects

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,650
who have applied for the badge and for

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:08,530
the other tens of thousands of critical

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,540
projects out there that should apply for

00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:15,960
this badge so we're happy about this

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:18,190
milestone but we have oh so far to go

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,820
finally we need to see more qualified

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,620
professionals in open source you know at

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,080
the Linux Foundation training is one of

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,920
the important things we do we try and do

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,090
it either free or at low cost to offer

00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,680
curriculum to get more people in these

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,060
communities we've trained hundreds of

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,300
thousands over eight hundred sixty

00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,490
thousand developers we've given hundreds

00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,470
of scholarships dozens of diversity

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,900
internships many many need-based

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,430
scholarships just this year but today

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,890
we're announcing a new program called

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:51,370
the kubernetes certified service

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:54,460
provider or which is basically a way

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,770
that the industry can help support the

00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,340
kubernetes project very very early on in

00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:02,530
its hyper growth and what this is is a

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,020
combination of our certified kubernetes

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,520
administrator program many of you might

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,650
know that but the Linux Foundation has

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,320
an Anytime Anywhere skills-based

00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,510
certification test where you can go sign

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,370
up for this and you're asked to come in

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,480
to a webinar if it's in fact the guy who

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:21,120
runs it is right in front of me right

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,950
now the you come into a web browser a

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,780
proctor through your webcam ask you to

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,640
do a series of tests you actually have

00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,880
to do it Jerry is right

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,590
me helps design these tests so you

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,700
really have to prove you've know what

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,220
you're doing it's not a multiple-choice

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,830
test it's you got to do the actual thing

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,710
you've purported to do and for

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,360
organizations that have more than three

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,310
certified kubernetes administrators they

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,540
can get it could become a kubernetes

00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:52,180
service provider and that creates a

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,040
support ecosystem around that project

00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,570
very very early that helps grow the

00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,730
project get more developers create more

00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,950
value gets into that feedback loop so

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,990
we're very happy about that today so

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,670
with that I just have a few additional

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,740
announcements and then I'm gonna move on

00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,840
to our next speaker first we want to

00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,610
welcome Vodafone to our open network

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,410
automation platform I talked about this

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:15,820
earlier this now grows the number of

00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:18,550
operators that are working on that

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,500
project I want to welcome Samsung to our

00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,780
edge X foundry project the world's

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,510
largest device maker has now joined our
