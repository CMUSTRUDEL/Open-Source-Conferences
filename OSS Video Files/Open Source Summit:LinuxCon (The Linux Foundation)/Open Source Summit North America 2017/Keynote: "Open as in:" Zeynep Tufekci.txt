About Zeynep Tufekci
Zeynep Tufekci is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with an affiliate appointment at the Department of Sociology. She is also a faculty associate at the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society, and was previously a fellow at the Center for Information Technology Policy at the Princeton University. Tufekciâ€™s research interests revolve around the intersection of technology and society. Her academic work focuses on social movements and civics, privacy and surveillance, and social interaction. She is also increasingly known for her work on "big data" and algorithmic decision making. Originally from Turkey, and formerly a computer programmer, Tufekci became interested in the social impacts of technology and began to focus on how digital and computational technology interact with social, political and cultural dynamics. Her work has appeared in a wide range of outlets, from peer-reviewed journals to traditional media and blogging platforms. Her forthcoming book Beautiful Teargas: The Ecstatic, Fragile Politics of Networked Protest in the 21st Century, to be published by Yale University Press, will examine the dynamics, strengths and weaknesses of 21st century social movements.

as I told him nobody knows what it's

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,940
supposed to be so there's no ground

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,630
truth for him to worry about on how to

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,000
pronounce my last name so I'm from

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,889
Turkey that's why I have that hard to

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,449
pronounce last name Turkish is not

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:21,779
related to indo-european languages and I

00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:25,050
started programming pretty much as a kid

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:28,529
what happened was I just through pure

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,029
luck I bought myself a computer before

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,790
there were a lot of personal computers

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:36,630
around and I got to experience that

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,329
early almost magical stage when things

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,090
were a lot less complicated than they

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,820
are now and the way I learned

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,390
programming was when you got the

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,250
computer I had which was a ZX spectrum

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,050
there were no ready made programs for it

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,360
that were available to me so what I did

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,949
was we had magazines and we would type

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,559
up the programs because that's all I

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,090
knew what to do and all the programs had

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,620
bugs none of whom worked they were

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,070
supposed to be games but none of whom

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,380
would work so I would figure out what

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,330
the bugs were and I soon realized

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,100
finding out what the bug was was a lot

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,600
more fun than whatever the game was

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,790
supposed to be and I was kind of hooked

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,979
for that so I just started teaching

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,580
myself what I could and I'm still a

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,460
teenager and then because of my own

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,009
family circumstances I had to start

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,650
working pretty much as soon as I started

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,299
college the very first semester and I'd

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,100
been thinking what do I do you know what

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,689
kind of a job will I have I had thought

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,479
about that for a long time in high

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,460
school too and I was interested in a lot

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,259
of things I was interested in physics I

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,450
was interested in a lot of sort of math

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,340
related things but I thought you know

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,740
what physics has all these ethical

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,299
problems you know nuclear weapons and

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,340
all of that so I said why don't I pick a

00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:56,070
profession that doesn't have a lot of

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,130
ethical issues to deal with where I'll

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,200
just be able to you know program and not

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,590
have anything to worry about

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,810
so that's how I got into computers which

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,459
tells you that I probably don't have the

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,220
best foresight on where the ethical

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,069
issues are going to be because I don't

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,010
think there's a profession that is

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:18,290
more at the center of so many thorny

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,010
ethical issues in terms of where things

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,709
are where things are going and our

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,780
generation and by which I mean people

00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,999
who are you know sort of designing and

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,810
thinking about computing as an

00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:35,840
infrastructure at the moment as going

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,659
through and making decisions and I got

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,769
to live through that early stage I think

00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:46,150
that really exemplifies some of what we

00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:48,950
mean when we say open and free software

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:52,400
it was that era where you could just

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,019
email someone and you'd be just telling

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,269
them you know I don't know you I have

00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:58,040
some questions and there is a good

00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,329
likelihood they could reply back to you

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,340
even if they were some big-name

00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:04,699
professor somewhere and you were nobody

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:09,319
a kid from Istanbul so it was really

00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:13,129
amazing and just within my lifetime I

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:17,359
have seen computing go from that kind of

00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:19,609
freewheeling early stages to what it is

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,840
now where we're seeing increasingly

00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:25,370
enormous amount of centralization

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,579
asymmetric power transfer if anything

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:32,650
computing and computers are becoming one

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:35,000
of the tools for concentrating power and

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,280
disempowering people in many ways and

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,500
that's the part that I think about a lot

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,379
from those very early days where it was

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,139
just like magic to me to nowadays where

00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:49,819
I am worrying about all the things that

00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:52,129
we see so you know here at an Linux

00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:54,590
conference and open-source summit I

00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:57,139
wanted to really think about the

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,030
philosophy of open because you know how

00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,639
we would tried it when you said free and

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,969
open you try to explain to people free

00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:07,519
but not isn't beer as in free speech

00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:09,469
right that kind of free so I think

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,109
sometimes it's really good to think

00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:13,969
about what do we mean by open and what

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,699
are the philosophical underpinnings of

00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:19,789
that idea and in this historical

00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:21,680
Junction how do we keep the philosophy

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,419
and how do we think about what it could

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,219
be because there are a lot of

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,490
technologies if you look at them they

00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:30,849
kind of

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,190
decentralized and open and then over

00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:34,900
time they become closed and they become

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,960
instruments of power they become

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,240
instruments of war they become things

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,150
that are not what they started with one

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,819
very sort of obvious example is how ham

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,340
radio original radio you know what we

00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:52,629
think of us ham radio was what radio was

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,569
it was an interactive global interesting

00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:58,479
freewheeling thing and within the space

00:04:55,569 --> 00:05:01,150
of a generation it became first an

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,190
instrument of war and then a massive

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,259
centralization and then finally became

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,389
this one way product would just spoke to

00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:09,250
people and advertise to them so how do

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:13,569
we think about that kind of historical

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:17,080
moment so when I think about the sort of

00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:19,449
what makes open-source products work in

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,909
some ways this is like you're supposed

00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,770
to have triads but I have four so

00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:27,099
there's and I know there's been a lot of

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:30,669
discussion about the reliable part and I

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:32,380
know security is a huge topic that's

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,900
come up I heard it in the keynotes

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,240
yesterday so I'm not going to talk about

00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,219
it usability has been discussed forever

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,870
in this community so these are not the

00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:44,289
ones that I'm going to talk about either

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:49,630
I want to go back to this what do I mean

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:54,580
by open and open as in what kind of open

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:57,039
so when we have sort of open source the

00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,840
first thing you think about is well it's

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,120
what it says right the source is open

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,930
you can read it you can see it but

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:08,740
obviously increasingly we're computer is

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:14,490
going is access to the source code even

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:17,379
if it is possible is not sufficient to

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,509
provide what open was supposed to

00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:22,509
provide philosophically which was access

00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,759
and which was a way to not concentrate

00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:27,599
power but to distribute it and to

00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,409
decentralize it and a lot of the sort of

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,330
cutting-edge stuff you know we're

00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:33,759
talking in San Francisco after

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,770
cutting-edge stuff or where the money is

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,210
and when you sort of look at where the

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,889
venture capitalists are going and where

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,539
you look at where the business are

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,689
investing in all the companies they're

00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:45,400
buying it's very much focused on

00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,550
artificial intelligence and machine

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,319
learning and various classes of machine

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,430
learning systems like deep learning and

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,939
these are systems that are by nature and

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,189
by definition closed even if you have

00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,110
access to the source code so I want to

00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:04,659
throw it out as a challenge I know this

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,430
is not something that you do say in

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:11,050
Linux but it's a challenge to think

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:13,150
about how do we keep computing open the

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,300
way it was originally envisioned in the

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:19,389
open source movement in a world in which

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,550
access to the source code even if you

00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:24,069
have it right in front of you is not

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,650
giving you the transparency the

00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:30,039
decentralization and the understanding

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:32,349
that open was supposed to involve so I

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:35,500
mean obviously a lot of you know how

00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:37,719
this works but just sort of in general

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,729
what's increasingly happening is we have

00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:43,870
these computers that know how to learn

00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:47,229
we have these programs that function not

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,969
the way I used to type in programs and

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,400
not the way most of us have programmed

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:54,069
but through chewing through large

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,339
amounts of data and creating layers and

00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:02,229
layers of neural networks and then

00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:04,210
churning out classifications and just as

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,319
you can't take a cross-section of my

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,110
brain right now

00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,750
which I hope nobody would but if you did

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,009
you wouldn't be able to say exactly what

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,409
I was thinking right there's

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,930
consciousness it emanates from my brain

00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:19,210
and my mind there but it's not something

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:23,199
you can just look at the organization of

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:25,810
my you know neurons and say increasingly

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,819
computing is becoming something similar

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,800
to that and how do we deal with that

00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,019
challenge and how do we think about open

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,649
in a world like this and the other thing

00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:38,079
is because of this not the triad but the

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:42,279
the triad part the reliable secure and

00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:47,709
usable have increasingly become vectors

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:50,550
that promote centralization users I I

00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:52,240
deal with a lot of people that are very

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,369
they're they're not

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,509
programmers they're ordinary people and

00:08:54,369 --> 00:09:00,639
for them things that are you know pretty

00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:02,619
basic usability questions are big

00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,360
instrumental insurmountable challenges

00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,860
and I know this has been discussed a lot

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,170
in this community how do we make our

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,350
products more usable but what has

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:14,350
increasingly happened is they gravitate

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,230
towards the programs that where there's

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,970
you know large numbers of people that

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,429
are working on the usability side and

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,559
therefore easier to work and also

00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:25,959
security is such a big issue without

00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:29,879
large security teams increasingly it's

00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,990
hard to keep software secure and

00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,269
unfortunately as we keep saying again

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,939
and again there's a huge amount of the

00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:39,189
infrastructure of the internet that is

00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:42,670
open and you know open-source software

00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:44,920
but it's maintained usually by a few

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,959
volunteers here and there or small

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,689
groups or sometimes a few foundations

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,149
and we've seen these lead to security

00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:54,970
mishaps again and again the heartbleed

00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:57,220
was one example we've recently seen some

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,639
of the Apaches stuff come up with the

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,249
Equifax security breach so the usability

00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,769
reliability and security have

00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:09,429
increasingly have tipped the balance

00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:11,529
towards centralized platforms and users

00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:13,569
are going to those so that's one way in

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:16,959
which that the philosophy of open is

00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:18,519
being challenged too but so let me sort

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,980
of say the challenges here

00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,209
I think the computering is closing to

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,889
interpretation the way our generation

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:28,240
exercised and understood this to mean I

00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:30,730
mean it didn't mean you could just look

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,290
at the some large code base and exactly

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,089
understand what's going on but

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,649
theoretically it was possible if you

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,209
worked on a program and if you kind of

00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,949
dove into it you could understand what

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,749
was going on and if there's a problem

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:44,499
you could understand what it was doing

00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:47,019
and what it was not doing the new coming

00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:49,240
wave that I think is going to come

00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,100
everywhere is not this model it is a

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,990
data surveillance model that turns

00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,759
through that data and comes up with

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,649
opaque and non transparent and

00:10:54,759 --> 00:11:00,009
uninterpretable machine learning systems

00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:02,290
that make decisions it's closing the

00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:05,529
closing the day decentralization it's

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:08,529
becoming I fear a little bit

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,670
like the radio situation where yes

00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:12,310
you know there's open-source software

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:18,550
that is running large amounts of

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:20,290
internets yeah I think it's fixed large

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:24,040
amounts of the Internet's infrastructure

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:28,029
but for ordinary people increasingly the

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,949
usability and security issues have just

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,949
made them move away from that so it's

00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:34,379
becoming more and more centralized and

00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:37,870
computing is becoming increasingly

00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:40,329
asymmetric with regards to how its

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,059
distributing power so when I started

00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:45,370
right when I started in this world it

00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:49,319
was a way in which that I felt empowered

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:53,319
I got to talk to people around the world

00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:55,360
I got to build stuff which was amazingly

00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:58,329
fun I got to build stuff that worked I

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,430
could do things and it was a way in

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,930
which that I think a lot of us and still

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,259
in our current generation it has

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,439
empowered us but right now if you look

00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:10,779
at the way computing is exercised and

00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:12,459
the way it's functioning in the world it

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,800
is increasingly a way in which people

00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:17,319
are surveilled they're controlled

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,930
they're replaced their jobs are

00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:22,269
threatened their operating systems spy

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,949
on them they don't understand what's

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,689
going on there's great control so how do

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:28,000
we deal with this and how what are the

00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:30,970
resources and what is the philosophy to

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,220
try to not make this inevitable I want

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,050
to give two examples just from this week

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,569
like the kind of research I'm seeing

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:41,379
just like from I just pulled two things

00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:43,990
from literally this week and one of them

00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:47,290
was a paper that was using machine

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:50,350
learning to identify protesters whose

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:55,000
faces were covered by scarves or caps or

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:56,470
glasses they were using just churning

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,720
through the machine learning stuff now

00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,929
it was an early paper and a Maine may

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,370
not work a lot but you know today was

00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:05,889
Apple day and there was a lot of

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:10,089
announcement on how good's Apple's face

00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:12,910
ID is and Apple is pretty good with its

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:16,089
phones and security but we now have

00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,769
computing technologies that can identify

00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,989
your face and Apple claims

00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:23,899
the error rate is as low as one in a

00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:26,029
million ten in a million those are very

00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:28,309
low rates I don't know if it's gonna

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,619
hold up but that's the direction so what

00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:32,809
does it mean when computing instead of

00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:35,389
the thing that sort of empowered me in

00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:38,660
my youth it's now the thing that's going

00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:40,819
to pick up everything I'm doing even if

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,999
I have my face covered with a scarf Who

00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,999
I am

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,839
there was another paper this week that

00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:49,879
was researchers were using facial

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,459
recognition tools to predict sexual

00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:55,100
orientation I mean I only would know

00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:58,220
where to begin with this that we've gone

00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,579
back to some form of phrenology that we

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,350
have these things being done and these

00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,420
are being done by academics who are

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,209
probably demonstrating things but it

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,519
almost doesn't matter because even if

00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,529
academics didn't do this these are the

00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,749
technologies that authoritarians are

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:20,509
going to be using at a mass scale and

00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:23,600
these are just from this week so when we

00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:27,619
think about a future further open and

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,600
open as in human-controlled open as in

00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:32,199
human interpret evolved and more

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,660
importantly open as a human centered

00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:37,579
where is that movement I mean just like

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,069
the way in the early days of the

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:41,660
internet there was a movement to say you

00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:44,480
know what we're not going to turn this

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,879
into yet another television although I

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,519
don't think we've completely succeeded

00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,959
but it's really not just another

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,259
television it's a very complicated

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,199
technology with still a lot of opening

00:14:54,259 --> 00:15:00,199
and with still a lot of dynamism and how

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:04,389
do we sort of create a movement that

00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:09,259
tries to reclaim that kind of open where

00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:10,879
we don't surrender to these overlords as

00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,429
computers which is how most people are

00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,559
increasingly experiencing it and how do

00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:18,079
we keep interpretability and

00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:19,819
understanding in the way we do our

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,610
programming and the way we build our

00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:25,549
computing machines and more importantly

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,790
what are the tools we need to develop to

00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:30,669
empower people so that it is not this

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,339
asymmetric thing that is just

00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:35,129
surveilling them and from

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,439
rolling them and I think just the

00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:42,149
source-code being open is obviously not

00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:45,600
going to be enough for this we're going

00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:49,069
to need platforms we're going to need

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,329
mechanisms we're going to need ways of

00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:56,639
interacting with this new technology

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:58,800
that allow the other parts of the the

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,290
triad the reliability usability and

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,209
security that provide those that we've

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,910
struggled with so long in the

00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:08,879
open-source community at least but also

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:13,110
puts in afla sophocles different way of

00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:15,660
interacting with computing power and i

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,509
by that I mean interacting with the

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,269
large platforms interacting with nation

00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:23,129
states that are using these technologies

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:25,050
to surveil the interacting with

00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:27,420
corporations that are using these

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,059
technologies to understand and

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,110
manipulate at the moment a lot of this

00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:37,050
is coming in the form of add technology

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:38,790
add technology for example to recognize

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,800
your emotions in your face to figure out

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,199
how to sell you things better now that

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,029
doesn't sound great but it doesn't sound

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,740
as bad as it can be people kind of roll

00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,449
their eyes we've always had ads and

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,230
that's kind of true but the

00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:54,029
infrastructure we're building here this

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,269
kind of surveillance infrastructure

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:59,249
we're building mostly for ads but also

00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:01,920
for data collection it's the

00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:03,929
infrastructure of authoritarianism I

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,970
mean no two ways about it the

00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:07,880
infrastructure we're building is the

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,919
infrastructure of authoritarianism and

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,089
ironically it's coming from a technology

00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:17,100
whose originators mostly and a lot of

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,089
its early practitioners and to this

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:23,699
state this enormous community is

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:26,130
philosophically not just not in that

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:29,100
side of things is absolutely and

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,440
completely opposed to it and yet step by

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,100
step now for the past ten years every

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,470
year I see it becoming more and more in

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:41,760
this direction less controlled by us

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:45,540
less interpreter by us and more serving

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,370
those in power and less serving us

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,500
so this is kind of a challenge I

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,090
obviously don't have answers if I did I

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,500
would say year let's do this and less of

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:59,470
that will be done but we need new things

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,500
and different things that reach a mass

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,020
base and obviously doing something like

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,520
that is going to require resources it's

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,260
going to require a lot of volunteer

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,390
energy it's going to require a lot of

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,640
refusing to work in some of the ways in

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,870
which our computing infrastructure is

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,850
becoming an infrastructure of

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:20,080
authoritarianism and centralized control

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:22,240
and maybe we can also think about what

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,600
are the technologies that people need in

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,020
their everyday lives and is there a way

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,540
to give them reliable secure usable

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,270
versions of these technologies that do

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,670
not also robbed them of power that do

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,610
not also surveil them that do not also

00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:42,250
create this world in which there are

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,410
objects to be manipulated and can we

00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,850
figure out how to deal with the sort of

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,740
onslaught of artificial intelligence

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:52,510
especially in the form of machine

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:56,200
learning that is just this black box

00:18:52,510 --> 00:19:00,460
that is being imposed on people I think

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,710
there's great room for that because when

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,170
I spoke about this stuff maybe five six

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,940
years ago now people in the technical

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,410
world would understand but ordinary

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,180
people would say what are you talking

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,580
about this is great you know I got my

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,320
phone I can talk to everyone it was true

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,510
it's really great I mean they're lauded

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,530
that that's that's the paradox it really

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:23,740
is great and I would have a hard time

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,090
kind of talking about these fears I had

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,350
even then because you could see the

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,900
centralization you could see these

00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:32,140
trends and nowadays I think there's a

00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,540
large number of people that have felt

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,730
what we're just talking about directly

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,060
in the just ordinary world outside the

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:42,130
tech community so my plea is is there I

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,590
think that it's a historical turning

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,270
point and I mean I don't want to sound

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,130
like I'm just hyping something but I

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,080
really think that we have maybe five

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,870
maybe ten something in that order of

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,380
scale before we have we closed this

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,670
window and just the way radio became

00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,810
something interactive and two-way to

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,840
this

00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:05,860
one way corporate broadcast mechanism

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,450
it's quite plausible that digital world

00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,540
and technology information technology

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:13,030
will become something like that in a way

00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:16,150
that is very hard to get back from in

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:19,540
our generation and we'll be telling

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,790
stories of how it used to be but we're

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,770
not there yet there's time to do things

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,450
there's time to really change things and

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,670
there's now we're right at that moment

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,090
there's sufficient awareness of these

00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:33,850
issues and there's a large community of

00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:37,000
people in the technology world who are

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,280
bothered by these and could take things

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,230
another way so that's my plea and that's

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,000
where I'm going to end and this is sort

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,500
of any questions comments again

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,630
obviously I don't I'm not going to have

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,300
an answer to this but I think this is a

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:52,210
big challenge facing everyone concerned

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,200
about these technologies we're building

00:20:52,210 --> 00:21:02,749
and their effects in the world thank you

00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:02,749
