hello thank you very much everyone for

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,770
joining in today I'm very glad to be

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,960
here

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,019
I'm Tanmay Bakshi I'm from Toronto

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,000
Canada and I'd like to say a big thank

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,790
you to the team at the Linux Foundation

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,500
and the open source summit for actually

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,930
inviting me to have this keynote at this

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,760
great conference today but I'd like to

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,160
start off by telling you all a little

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,590
bit about myself and what I like to do

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,449
as mentioned I am a software and

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,269
cognitive developer as well as an

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,460
algorithmic at Darwin ecosystem I'm also

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,399
an author TEDx and keynote speaker

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,129
youtuber course instructor for udemy I'm

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,280
an IBM champion for cloud honorary cloud

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,739
advisor and the host of an IBM Facebook

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,469
live series called Watson made simple

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,379
with Tanmay but going into a bit more

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,510
detail as I mentioned I'm a youtuber and

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,670
I have a YouTube channel called Tanmay

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,109
teachers with over 80,000 subscribers

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,960
and over 145 videos on this channel I

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,140
absolutely love to teach about topics

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,439
like computing programming algorithms

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,000
machine learning Watson and artificial

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,439
intelligence math science and of course

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,900
neural networks which I'll be getting a

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,570
lot deeper into and just a little bit

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,700
but as I also mentioned I'm an author

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,490
and I've written a book called hello

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,040
Swift iOS app programming for kids and

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,350
other beginners and I'm also currently

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,259
working on writing another book about

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,150
IBM Watson which will give you a simple

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,470
beginning to the deep learning as a

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,259
service api's that IBM Watson provides

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,960
but as you can tell so far I am really

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,479
passionate about services like IBM

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,090
Watson and especially how you can

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,509
integrate custom machine learning

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,149
capabilities into your applications and

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,920
to demonstrate for you how much I really

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,829
love was she learning and what I've done

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,990
with it I've hand-picked three of the

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,270
open source projects that I've worked on

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,610
that I think you're going to be very

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,970
interested in and out of all these

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,489
projects it starts off with ask Tanmay

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,900
as Tanmay was actually my very first

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:17,319
artificial intelligence project that

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,780
created in October of 2015 it's an open

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,000
source an LQA or natural language

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,299
question answering systems that can

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,640
answer your person organization or

00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,920
location natural language questions it's

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,750
built off of IBM Watson's natural

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,269
language understanding and natural

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,579
language classifier services and uses

00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,859
custom machine learning built in by a

00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:40,359
bi-directional attention flow by Allen

00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:43,150
AI in tensorflow

00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:45,819
in fact not only is this just any lqi

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,150
system it's the world's first web-based

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:52,180
an LQA system to be powered by IBM

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,670
Watson in fact this over here is a chart

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,159
of how the Aston May system works this

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,470
is the Aston my algorithm the new

00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,879
version that I've created and I won't go

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,230
into too much detail of how it works

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,079
just yet I don't have enough time for

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,400
that unfortunately I will tell you a

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,750
little bit of how it works

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,849
it starts off of course with the

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,590
question and the data that asked anime

00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,109
has to actually try and find the answer

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,959
from and in this case I'm using a search

00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:19,090
engine Google but then I Stan may

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,620
actually have to try and find out what

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,260
your question is actually looking for

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,690
and that's done by a TD or answer type

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,900
detection stage asked and made then has

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,989
to use deep learning through DLA RFS and

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,629
DLN am steps to actually try and find

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,579
answers that could be the correct answer

00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:39,430
to your question and from there it has

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:42,609
to try and score and merge those answers

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,799
via the SCM or similar candidate merging

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:46,599
step which will merge different answers

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
that mean the same thing semantically

00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,239
but they may not mean the same thing

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,220
syntactically but instead of me standing

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,229
here telling you how last time it works

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm sure that you're going to be very

00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:03,159
interested to see a demo of a Stan may

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,750
itself working thank you now I'll switch

00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,699
over to my Mac here where I'll show you

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,889
a demo of the asked anime system in

00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:12,400
action as you can see over here I've got

00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:14,260
a terminal window open and if I'd like

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,539
to ask a stand me a question all I need

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,340
to do is run a simple shell script I'm

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:22,389
going to be timing this shell script as

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,099
it runs and so I'll just run ask SH and

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,080
I'll give it my question in this case

00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:28,480
let's get a question that we all know

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,230
the answer to so we can make sure it's

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:37,990
in this case where is the open source

00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:38,440
summit North America being held all

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,940
right

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,940
so now of course it asks me for my

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,950
password so you know uh and from here

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,690
what's going to happen is asked him and

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,370
we'll start off by initializing by a

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,990
knife and Chancellor flow what this is

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,180
doing right now so it's opening up the

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,310
saved and pre-trained model for bite off

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,890
then it instantly searches two pages of

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,540
Google results runs a TD it realizes

00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,590
we're looking for a location runs the

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,560
entire natural language understanding

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,670
step and as you can see it returns Los

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,590
Angeles as the correct answer with 54%

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,990
confidence and in fact you can see here

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,310
out of all of the cannon answers that

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,950
asked him a had at the end

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,190
all three are technically correct Los

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:20,530
Angeles LA and California are all

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,690
correct in this case but another

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,210
question that I'm sure of course a lot

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,350
of us here I mean practically everyone

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,700
knows the answer to

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:34,960
let's ask it something like who invented

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,880
Linux and get alright so now of course

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,710
what's going to happen ask 10 may will

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,590
again go over to Google first it's going

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,330
to start off by initializing tensorflow

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,610
it's going to load the pre train model

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,290
it's going to run a TD and Ser SEO or

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,430
search engine results summary extraction

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,410
it'll run the natural language

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,180
understanding stuff it'll be everything

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,280
in parallels this is very scalable with

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,840
more course and as you can see it

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,240
returns linus torvalds

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,630
as the correct answer with seventy-five

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,770
percent confidence and that was a demo

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,180
of the stand a system in action all

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,120
makes a little bit bigger so you can see

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,030
that in back alright so that was a demo

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,200
of asked anime in action I do hope you

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:19,039
enjoyed that demo now we can get back

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:24,060
over to my slides here thank you

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,699
thank you thank you all so that was how

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,060
last and my works now though I'd like to

00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:32,490
take you to a separate field an AI

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,770
utility and security with an application

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,669
of mine that I'm very excited about and

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:41,940
it's called deep Spade deep spade stands

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,919
for deep spam detection and aims to

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,259
build off of the work of a group of

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,780
programmers called charcoal as a

00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,819
charcoal Stack Exchange are a group of

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,190
programmers dedicated to making Stack

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:56,070
Exchange a better place and they

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,229
actually have a tool that allows that

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,990
allows you to actually detect rapport

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,099
flag spam on the stack exchange network

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,310
instantly

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:06,900
it's called smoke detector and instead

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,060
of me telling you more about charcoal

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,130
and smoke detector I thought it would be

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,650
better if we heard from charcoal

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,449
themselves and so I've invited Felix

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,490
from the charcoal team to tell you a

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,889
little bit more about charcoal and what

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,020
they're doing but unfortunately he

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,500
wasn't able to join us today physically

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,270
he's in Germany right now however we can

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,610
definitely get on a Skype call with him

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,800
and actually hear a little bit more

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,240
about charcoal and what they're doing so

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,669
we can switch over to my Mac here and

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,280
I'll start off by um of course going

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:47,280
over to Skype here so I'm going to call

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:50,400
Felix v Felix hello ah hi how are you um

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,780
I'm good thank you great so would you

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,039
like to tell the audience a little bit

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,860
more about yourself and where you are

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,750
right now my name is Felix and I'm

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,210
calling from Germany my username on

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,759
Stack Exchange this message alright

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,229
great so tell us a little bit more about

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,110
what charcoal isn't what you're doing

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:09,120
there it's an open source project by

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,759
members of Stack Exchange it started off

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,650
to make moderator tooling but right now

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,380
our main focus is to detect and deal

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,969
with spam ok so tell me a little bit

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,169
more about smoke detector I know this is

00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:22,020
the project we've been working on what a

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,909
smoke detector it's a Python script that

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,919
scans all new posts on Stack Exchange

00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:28,560
and runs them through a set of filters

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,839
to see whether their spam or not ok so

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,500
tell me a little bit more about how the

00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,330
actual filters behind some

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,740
detector work so smoke detector has

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,560
these filters to try and find spam what

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,240
are these filters they're mostly reg X

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,790
patterns that members have identified

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,070
over the years okay so I see it uses

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,390
regular expressions and so tell me a

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,010
little bit more about the auto flagging

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,300
feature I know smoke detector can

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,830
actually take accounts and actually

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,770
automatically flag tell me a little bit

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:56,020
more about that base enough a database

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,910
of member feedback on reported post we

00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,590
can judge how accurate our filters are

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,720
and based on combinations of that we're

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,210
using volunteer accounts to cast Pam

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,790
flex automatically on post a very short

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:10,300
span I see now one more interesting

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,920
thing Felix is that so far deep spade

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,190
it's open source and it's a in the

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,980
source code was completely closed source

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,170
but just like ask Jan May I made that

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,270
open source in in in June another

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,490
project of mine during different my

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,260
keynote a developer connect I'd like to

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,240
open source deep Spade to the entire

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,400
community and of course the charcoal on

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,230
stage here right now so I really do hope

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,660
I've been able to contribute to the

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,700
smoke detector project Felix and I

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,200
really do hope that of course in the

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,180
future I'm able to continue to improve

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,880
the system and help you improve the

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,470
accuracy of smoke detector yeah I look

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,450
forward to see how you can help us

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,790
improve the smoke detector with machine

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,040
learning thank you very much for joining

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,900
in today I know it's around a 2 a.m. for

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,350
you there but again thank you very much

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,950
for joining have a great day you too

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:03,680
thank you good bye bye

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:07,140
that was Felix thank you

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,930
thank you and so now deep spade which

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,520
runs deep spam detection tasks via deep

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,770
learning is now completely open-source

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,150
on my github page and of course I do

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,920
welcome everyone in the community to

00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,720
contribute to it learn from it and of

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,430
course apply it to other websites where

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,230
you believe made that that you believe

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,660
may benefit from it I know YouTube email

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,790
Korra they can definitely use systems

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,520
like these now we can switch back over

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,350
to my slides and that was team of

00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,180
charcoal but now that you know a little

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,000
bit more about smoke detector itself

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,160
let's talk more about deep Spade deep

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,410
spade itself is powered by a natural

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,470
language classification model built with

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,600
convolutional neural networks and gated

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,910
recurrent units and I'm going to be

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,130
talking a lot about why exactly this

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,510
model actually works and why it's so

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,640
great in fact I actually already talked

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,250
about it yesterday during my blf talk

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,760
and of course my blog on the linux.com

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:02,040
website but the backend technology of

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,440
this entire system is actually powered

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,630
by cross with the tensor flow backend

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:12,420
and Python 2.7 code and in fact charcoal

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,180
actually gave me a damn dump of all the

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,120
spam and non-spam posts collected from

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:22,460
smoke detector and using that I actually

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:24,930
I actually got 98% accuracy on around

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,330
15,000 testing rows so I'm very

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,490
satisfied with how this works but again

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,020
instead of me standing here telling you

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,700
how this works and telling you the

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,350
accuracy count I think it would be

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,460
better if you could actually take a look

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,050
at deeps made itself and how it works

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,310
all right so now what I'm gonna go or

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,200
what I'm gonna do here so I'm going to

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,030
switch over to a PHP interface that I've

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,490
got running for deep Spade and how it

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,380
works now this PHP interface allows me

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,210
to enter in posts and it should allow me

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,460
to actually classify a spam or non-spam

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,440
and I'm also got this text file over

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,960
here this text file contains two sty

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,530
overflow posts and these are real posts

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,270
copied and pasted it from Stack Exchange

00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:05,190
so I'll do is I'll go ahead and take the

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,590
very first post which seems like it may

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,420
be a spam post because I mean they give

00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,260
out loans to any country all over the

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:15,870
world and so theoretically this lsdm

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,610
when I'm loading on Alice TMC ru and

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,060
and combination ensemble these two

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,430
models will run on an i7 GPU a CPU or

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,000
without any GPUs and tensorflow returns

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:29,070
spam as the correct answer within around

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,410
four seconds and remember it's still

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,820
running all of the initialization code

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,010
it's sorting all the pre-processing

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,020
steps and then it's returning the answer

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,320
the actual performance of the system is

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:43,980
much much greater now we can actually go

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,930
back and take the non-spam post and now

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,029
I shall be able to post it I should be

00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:51,690
able to paste it into this textbox and

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:54,089
if I click on submit this the interface

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:57,150
should tell me within four seconds that

00:12:54,089 --> 00:13:00,120
this is in fact not a spam post and that

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,040
was a demo of the deep space system in

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,540
action really do hope you enjoyed that

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,430
and of course this is just a little

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,680
example of how it can be applied to

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,680
stack overflow and stack exchange but it

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,900
can be applied to a wide variety of many

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,230
many more websites and practically any

00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:20,100
online community forum we can get back

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,290
to the slides now and next I'd like to

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,330
take you to an entirely separate field

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,690
where I believe that artificial

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:31,050
intelligence itself is making the most

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:33,089
impact and this field is the healthcare

00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,160
field and I'd now to talk about a

00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:38,820
project that's very close to my heart

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,860
called the cognitive story the basic

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,470
point of the cognitive story is to

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,600
augment people's lives and to do so

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,779
through the power of cognitive computing

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,550
and artificial intelligence in fact this

00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:54,240
project is actually a collaboration

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:58,110
effort between Darwin ecosystem IBM not

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,570
rocket science and me the first chapter

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,089
in this cognitive story is all about

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,970
assisting those with special needs to

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:09,089
allow them to live better easier and

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:12,240
really fuller lives and I'd now like to

00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:14,850
play a quick video clip describing Boo's

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,410
story the original person that we're

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,440
trying to help with the cognitive story

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:22,820
and in fact the origin of the cognitive

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,820
story itself

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,520
[Music]

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,200
the trip to meet boo started with a

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,420
simple tweet from the friend of a mother

00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,430
wondering if artificial intelligence

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,160
could be used to help a severely

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:50,430
disabled 29 year old woman communicate

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,740
with her family soon IBM's Tim Duncan

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,800
reached out to Darwin ecosystems tearing

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,810
bear to explore the possibilities within

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,150
weeks the two companies organized a

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,550
research trip into the rural community

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:05,460
just north of Toronto where booth lives

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,980
a solitary life having almost no contact

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,530
with the outside world the pair was

00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,570
joined by 13 year-old Tanmay Bakshi who

00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,280
was recruited to join the team because

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,010
of his skills with neural network

00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,560
systems the road to Boo's hometown was

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,420
sometimes desolate sometimes blustery

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,850
but by the time the team reached the

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,670
small town the Sun was bright and the

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,920
sky was blue it's not home to many a

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,870
hamlet like many others but in this

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,390
borough the developers were coming to

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,670
see just one resident they arrived at

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,530
booths ready to learn and understand a

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,080
woman who can only communicate the

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,570
broadest of concepts and only to those

00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,020
most intimate with her condition her

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,420
name

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,850
boo comes from a sound she could make as

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,920
a baby but can no longer make Boo is

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:52,050
quadriplegic suffering from Rhett

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,480
syndrome a rare and debilitating

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,280
neurological disorder but her parents

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,710
know when she's happy when she's

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,470
irritated or when she wants to watch TV

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,960
the simplest of desires interpreted by

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,880
the most intimate knowledge now the hope

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,460
is that artificial intelligence can

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,470
match EEG signals from boos brain to

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,990
what her parents say she's thinking and

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,780
a unique language born from cognitive

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:20,160
computing can act as boos translator to

00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:22,380
others and relieve her isolation so now

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,660
that you know a little bit more about

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,700
the story behind of the cognitive story

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,700
and now it could take you a little bit

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,710
deeper into the technical part itself of

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,930
course it starts off with the data that

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,660
we're able to gather from vu and there

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,279
case we've decided to use

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,529
electroencephalogram or EEG brain waves

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,930
for this task but once we've gathered

00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:45,210
the data from Buu it's in my job and my

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,339
role in the cognitive story to actually

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:50,220
use deep learning algorithms to try and

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,890
understand those brain waves to give Buu

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,630
this artificial communication ability

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,970
and out of all the deep learning

00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:00,300
algorithms I could have used I decided

00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:02,430
to use LS TM or long short-term memory

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,800
recurrent neural networks for this task

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,689
and the reason that I've went ahead and

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,730
actually decided to use these LS TM

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:11,670
neural networks is that these actually

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,679
showed the best performance when I just

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:16,530
tried them out or tested them on some

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,420
EMG or electromyogram data that we've

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,250
already gathered and now the next step

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,410
is that the team and I will actually be

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,689
travelling back up to boo and we're

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,000
going to be gathering the real EEG day

00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:29,130
and I wasn't around two to three weeks

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,440
and with that EEG data I'm going to

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,110
train these LST neural networks to give

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,230
Buu the sort of artificial communication

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,960
ability but one more misconception that

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,980
a lot of people have is well how are we

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,520
going to train a supervised learning

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:47,700
algorithm on unsupervised data that we

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,030
ourselves don't understand and well it's

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,010
quite simple this is supervised data and

00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,960
that's because there is someone who can

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,000
understand boo and that is boos mom

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,820
which is why we've given her the title

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,580
of intimate interpreter boos mom can

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,830
understand the very broad concepts that

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,410
Boo tries to convey and win their help

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,480
we're going to try and live label the

00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,000
training data as it's gathered from the

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,340
headset so I can train those neural

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,780
network systems if you'd like to find

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,820
out more about the cognitive story

00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,590
initiative and get in touch with me we'd

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,650
be glad to collaborate at the cognitive

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,410
story comm and that sums up what I had

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,780
to say about the cognitive story and how

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:32,429
we're using the power of cognitive to

00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,860
live better lives but next though to sum

00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:37,290
up I'd like to tell you all that all

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,020
three of these projects asked an may

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:43,530
deep spade and the cognitive story are

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,390
completely and 100% open-source asked an

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,309
may version 3.1 the new version that I

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,899
just talked about today will

00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,629
open source within the next two to three

00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:53,490
weeks deep spade as you just saw is now

00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:56,340
completely open source and the cognitive

00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,320
story is available on Darwin ecosystems

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,389
github page in fact one more thing that

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,249
I find really interesting is that every

00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,779
single one of these projects

00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:06,600
asked handmade deep spade and the

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:09,029
cognitive story were all developed in a

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,929
Linux environment and all use git

00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:15,419
version control and so as you can tell

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,850
these these tools that Linus Linus

00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,549
Torvalds has actually blessed us with

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:22,259
are really really useful for not just

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:24,360
developers at this point but really

00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,580
everybody across the world when they're

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,769
using a phone when they're using Google

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,919
or any other online software it's all

00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:33,899
powered by Linux powered by one of the

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,210
most popular version control software's

00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:38,580
out there get and so of course thank you

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,139
very much to line us for actually making

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,779
all these tools available to us

00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:44,399
developers and that sums up what I had

00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,809
to say today thank you very much

00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:47,279
everyone for joining in that's going to

00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,860
be all that I've got I really wanted to

00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,999
do a live Q&A session though because of

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,429
course I mean we've got two more minutes

00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:54,570
but unfortunately I won't be able to do

00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:56,009
that right now but you can ask me

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,289
questions after my keynote and I'd be

00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:59,460
glad to answer them apart from that if

00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,960
you'd like to reach out to me on any of

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,879
the following social media I'd be glad

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,880
to get in touch and that sums up what I

00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:09,479
had to say today thank you very much

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,479
