Description: 
	Keynote Lightning Talk: Human Enablement - Alan Clark, Director, Industry Initiatives, Emerging Standards and Open Source, SUSE

We recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of Linux; a major success in the progressive story of open source.  It is amazing to reflect on the drastic software, hardware and networking evolution over the last 2.5 decades.  At SUSE,  we have witnessed over the past 25 years, Business  change across all industries and use cases, thanks to the mass adoption of open source in general, and of Linux in particular.

And now we are at the root of an expanding explosion of innovation and technological ideas. Ideas that are turning into 100's of compelling open source projects. Is there a unifying driving force?  What is it that motivates business to change and for you and I to innovate new ideas and technological attainment?  Alan Clark, an experienced industry and corporate leader who has participated in open source for several years, will explore some ideas to provide thought on these questions in lightning time.

Alan is the current Board Chair for the Open Stack Foundation, is a board member for the openHPC and open Mainframe projects. Alan is a SUSE Director for Industry Initiatives, Emerging Standards and Open Source.

all right well it's good to be with you

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,670
today I appreciate the five minutes I

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,950
get to share with you and I have to tell

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,500
you as Jim mentioned I've been involved

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,500
with open source for many many years as

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,969
you can tell from the gray hair but this

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,090
has got to be one of the most exciting

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,830
times that I've ever seen and I'm truly

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,350
excited and it's because as Jim

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,660
mentioned open source is just exploding

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,760
it's catching on and there's all of

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,550
these great ideas and great technologies

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,109
that are gonna be talked about this week

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,300
a lot of them right but they're very

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,239
very exciting artificial intelligence

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,940
digital currencies distributed

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:44,489
signatures you know the IOT e-everything

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,140
is a service cloud right we can talk

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,780
about the list can go on and on and on

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,719
it seems like this huge spiral and

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,050
sometimes it can seem a bit confusing

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:59,039
about what in the heck is going on is

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:02,730
there any commonality to all this or is

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,070
it just this disparate list of ideas and

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,610
projects that everybody seems to be

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,640
working on and so I thought about and I

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,400
thought so where are we going right is

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,740
there any kind of direction that you can

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,509
put to most of these now there's a few

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,710
squirrels out there that you have to

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,530
scratch your head and wonder what the

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,680
heck they're doing but generally I've

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,070
come up with the idea that really what

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,270
we're doing is empowering humans with

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:36,090
technology for any place in any time

00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,369
okay maybe that's a little sounds a

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,939
little dumb but if you think about it

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,250
it's pretty pretty astute so let me give

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,369
you an example okay think about your

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,869
automobile an automobile is pretty basic

00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,060
right you've got brakes to stop you've

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,530
got an accelerator to get going and

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,710
you've got a steering wheel to give you

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,619
some direction automobiles have been

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,420
around for a long long time if you get

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,790
the latest car I purchased them the

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,040
owners manual is probably three times as

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,579
thick as the last one I bought and why

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,039
is that

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,530
alright the previous car I bought had

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,970
all kinds of sensors that would beep at

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,090
me and tell me that I'm going to

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,500
faster I'm swaying out of my lane

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,290
nowadays with the latest purchase the

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,350
car doesn't just beep at me it actually

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,180
corrects for me and takes over and tells

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,550
me that I'm being stupid and that it can

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,940
be do a better job right

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,640
so we're enabling humans with technology

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,860
and in some cases we're enabling with

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,590
such technology that they can actually

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,840
do a better job than we can so it's

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,350
quite fun but at the same time as

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,480
consumers our expectations are changing

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,090
okay so Jim mentioned Equifax and I

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,130
don't want to pick on them but I do want

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,870
to use them in as an example because

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,910
there's two places where they're gonna

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:01,780
take a huge hit we've seen one of them

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,880
already right they came out and they

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,560
announced okay we've lost all this data

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,530
that I don't understand why they have

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,540
control of it in the first place so they

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,700
took a hit and you saw that in their

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,300
stock price and the whole bit but

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:19,330
they're also taking a second hit and Jim

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,269
showed the thing right so I got on that

00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,250
list my expectation was okay I'm gonna

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,900
go check as soon as they announced it I

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,600
went out to check to see if I was one of

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,670
those 150 million or 180 million or

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,630
whatever the number is now to see if I

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,150
was on the list

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,670
okay so what did I get I got a response

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,560
that says yeah you're probably on the

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,030
list come back and talk to us next

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,470
Tuesday about signing you up for

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:47,470
identity security next Tuesday all right

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,180
that's a hacker's eternity I'm already

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,010
getting phone calls from people wanting

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,730
to talk to me about my credit history

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:57,519
all right so that's an eternity as a

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,860
consumer our expectations are much

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,480
different than years ago used to be you

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,660
know you go to your financial

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,940
institution you deposit money into the

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,340
account and our expectation was is we'd

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,489
be able to use it you know a week later

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,530
our expectations today are much

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,950
different than they used to be years ago

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,849
we demand instant services we demand

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,289
instant solutions we want them on demand

00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,010
right when Equifax happened I didn't

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,870
wait till I got home

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,320
right I was traveling I turn it on and

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,550
said I gotta go figure this out now so I

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,530
want that mobile access

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,980
I want it securely and I want it

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,900
reliably no matter wherever I'm at well

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,660
so if we look at that from a consumer

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,210
perspective that's putting huge demand

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,090
and pressure on the businesses that are

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,370
providing those services to us and if

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,420
you look at those businesses that's

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,000
turning right now I'm putting pressure

00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,340
on the people that are developing those

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,130
services those service providers or

00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,170
underlying infrastructure with the IT so

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,960
businesses have to dedicate themselves

00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:06,590
and differentiate themselves with speed

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,050
time to market fast response they've got

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,990
to be very agile and they've got to lead

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,930
their competition so the next question

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,030
you have to ask is ok if it's pressure

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,830
on the business that's pushing pressure

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,400
back onto those service providers and

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,830
onto the IT what's on their minds what

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,330
are they thinking about well it turns

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,590
about they're in this huge

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,230
transformation

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,690
all the way from their infrastructure

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,940
itself to the types of applications

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,520
they're deploying to the very

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,940
architecture of those applications and

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,120
even their development process huge

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,870
change huge motivation to change right

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,690
survivability well I have just a couple

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,930
seconds left but I wanted to throw this

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,970
slide in for two reasons one susi which

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,880
i've been a part of for many years is

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,680
empowering this transformation and I had

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,130
to throw this on here because I think

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,290
Suzy has one of the most fun mascots of

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,880
any any business in the industry all

00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,860
that at least half of you have picked up

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,800
one of these over the years to least

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,450
give to your kids right and what I

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,730
didn't wasn't able to bring because of

00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,260
the size of my luggage our expectations

00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,820
have changed we've all picked up one of

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,310
these and if you haven't go down the

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,410
seam in the booth and pick one up but

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,020
our expectations of changing because now

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,380
we have big ones right and we're all

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:34,460
coveting to get the big ones but even

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:37,190
sue says developed this power to help

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,600
you transform and I'm throwing up an eye

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,000
chart here

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,950
typically we talk about all the latest

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,380
and greatest technologies all that what

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,870
I call the the flashy stuff right the

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:51,260
containers of the service and the

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,300
kubernetes and platform as a service and

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,710
and all the cloud stuff but I actually

00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,050
didn't want to do that today

00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:01,520
I just wanted to take 30 seconds to talk

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,220
about something we actually don't talk

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,750
about as much and that's based off two

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,000
events that happened this week I want to

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,460
talk lower down and the staff actually

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,680
talked about the operating system so

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,640
there's two events that happened within

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,960
this last week first is an anniversary

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,570
of Sue's day they've been in business

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:26,900
for 25 years and as the first company to

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:29,030
deliver Enterprise sousei to to the

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,230
enterprise environment that means we've

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,390
been doing open source for a long time a

00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,580
lot of times we focus on what I call the

00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,220
flashy stuff the latest and greatest

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,770
stuff and I've had people say of any

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,860
open source project that's over five

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,140
years old as yesterday's news right well

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,800
if that's the case then what does that

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,200
make for Linux so the second which

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,720
brings me to the the second event that

00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,140
that happened last week and that is that

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,530
SUSE released their latest version of

00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:07,310
their enterprise operating system and

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,960
you would think after 25 years there

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:13,660
really wouldn't be any news at that

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:17,060
level right 25 years old project but yet

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,010
just the opposite let me just give you a

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,100
couple highlights here in the last 30

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:25,190
seconds - right to give you an idea of

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,780
what I'm talking about so you would

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,000
think after 25 years the amount of

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,539
choice would go down it's actually going

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,190
up right so for example sue says one of

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,900
one of their partnerships that they've

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,469
had probably almost from the beginning

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:43,789
is with IBM with the mainframe

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:44,680
right so we still have us less on on the

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,290
mainframe

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,100
they added functionality with this

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,670
latest release to optimize workloads

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:58,120
providing fulsome

00:08:52,670 --> 00:09:01,190
court for KBM on zseries okay intel

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,470
improve the infrastructure agility with

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,940
Intel supporting their latest and most

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:11,270
innovative Xeon series processors that's

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:14,260
being used to advance data analytics and

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,090
artificial intelligence also with AMD

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,850
added support for their latest series of

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,000
epic and Rison processors of course

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,430
we've got arm support for arm right arms

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,100
being used because of their ability for

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,550
high compute density and lower power

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,890
consumption which is driving a lot of

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,980
support in the area of high performance

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:40,940
computing then of course we've got the

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,890
the power systems which gives us high

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,320
performance for data analytics and

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,690
transformation with their power 9

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,040
processors and we see a lot of this

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:56,180
being used particularly in the SI P Hana

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,680
environment for extended virtual address

00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,570
space because of the extended virtual

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,790
address space think of the different

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,910
variety of processors and hardware that

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:08,300
out there that's being used again with

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:12,380
this release adding and support for nvm

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,990
Express write for faster read more

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,720
storage and so forth so new features of

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,030
project 25 years old new features new

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,700
functionality providing us more and

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:27,470
greater support more greater opportunity

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,420
and choice so just because a project has

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,540
some age doesn't mean that it's not

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,460
important and that it's not providing us

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,540
the choice that that we're looking for

00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,220
so this is why I'm I'm excited about the

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,000
opportunities that we have today with

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,770
open source because this technology not

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,870
just the latest and greatest and

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,970
shiniest but all these projects that

00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,430
we've been working on for years or

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,560
providing us the technologies and

00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:01,700
features that are enabling us as humans

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,130
to innovate and to realize a potential

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,370
that was not possible even a few years

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,930
ago

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:12,600
and for that I thank you for your time

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:15,620
thank you

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,620
