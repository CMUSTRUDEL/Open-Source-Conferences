	Unikernels and Explorations - Tiejun Chen, VMware

Unikernel is really beginning to attract people’s attention. Comparing to the traditional VM or the recent containers, Unikernels are smaller, more secure and efficient, making them ideal for cloud environments. There are already lots of open source projects but why these existing unikernels have yet to gain large popularity broadly? We think Unikernels are facing same major challenges. In this presentation, we will review our exploration of if-how we can construct the best platform of running unikernels cases like converting Linux as Unikernel. It's necessary to optimize that to gain some good performance and convenience to run any customized images based on different Linux profiles like Real-Time/Secure/.

About Tiejun Chen
I’m a staff engineer from ATC, Advanced Technology Center, VMware China. Currently we’re trying to work out our own Unikernel & IoT & Serverless project. Before join VMware, I worked at Wind River where I was responsible of developing Wind River Linux BSP, Kernel features and our own paraviratualized Guest OS, and submitted our fixes into mainstream like Linux/PowerPC/RT Linux. And then I joined OTC, Intel to enable new hardware features on open source community like KVM/XEN/Qemu.
