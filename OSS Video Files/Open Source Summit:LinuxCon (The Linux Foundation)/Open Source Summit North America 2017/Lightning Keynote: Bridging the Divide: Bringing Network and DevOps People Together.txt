Description: 
	Lightning Keynote: Bridging the Divide: Bringing Network and DevOps People Together to Build a Unified Cloud Native Future - Ed Warnicke, Principal Engineer, Cisco

Network and DevOps people have historically thought about the world in very different ways. But neither group can succeed independently of each other. Networks without workloads developed and deployed by DevOps teams are pointless. Applications without networking are uninteresting and border on being useless. And neither group really understands the depths of each other’s domain. And the results, so far, have been less than optimal for everyone. Ed will share thoughts on simple ways we can come together to build a better cloud native future –  together.

thank you Jeff

00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,009
[Music]

00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:10,280
so you've seen a lot of keynotes here

00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:14,180
today where people have talked about all

00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,430
kinds of interesting big ideas I only

00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,609
have five minutes so we're not doing

00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,990
that what we're gonna do right now is

00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,689
we're gonna do something much more

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,900
experimental we're gonna have a

00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:28,279
conversation so really quick calibration

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,199
exercise for those of you in the

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,440
audience who hear it can raise their

00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,739
hand that's much better than average

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:43,940
usually it's only about 60% so

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:46,250
congratulations so the topic that I'm

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,949
here to talk about is actually the

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:52,550
divide that we see between DevOps

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:55,039
and the networking people so really

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,719
quick show of hands who here in the

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,879
audience is a networking person who here

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,309
has opinions about routing protocols has

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,809
run networks has built networks has been

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,530
the guy whose head is on a plate if it

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,970
doesn't work okay that's actually a much

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,580
better than expected representation in

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,910
this crowd and who here thinks it

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:18,050
themselves as DevOps builds apps runs

00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,640
DevOps does see ICD and is making the

00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,000
transition or it's made the transition

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:30,500
to cloud native micro services etc

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,630
excellent good so I want to talk a

00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,890
little bit about history of the

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,280
relationship between those two groups of

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,420
people so back in the good old days we

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,140
had servers they didn't change much

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,390
there weren't a whole lot of them

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,450
changing at once you can sort of think

00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,130
of them as Dino the pet dinosaur and

00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,140
that worked relatively well you knew you

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,460
needed a server for your app a couple of

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,710
quarters ahead you started lobbying for

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,450
budgets it gives you plenty of time to

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,670
go talk to your networking people about

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,980
subnets and getting those servers

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,070
deployed and the networking portion of

00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,990
your exercise was usually all about

00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:08,390
racking stacking networking and it

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,099
worked because nobody had to move all

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,700
that fast and there weren't that many

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:16,069
things in motion and of course the world

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,840
changes and we moved to VMs

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,980
we can sort of think of them as the

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,299
apocryphal hurdled herd of cattle now

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,569
things moved a lot faster here there

00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:27,349
were a lot more things in motion and

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,969
let's be honest

00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:31,879
networking had some difficulty keeping

00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:34,310
up with the rate of change and so what

00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,099
you saw emerge in that case was a lot of

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,590
overlays over the network which that was

00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:42,200
there it was essentially pretending that

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,750
we were still in the world of servers by

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,939
compensating by having the servers to

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:52,069
overlays over the network that was being

00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:54,530
provided by networking and now we're in

00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,930
the middle of another transition to

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,359
micro services to containers to

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,090
serverless and I tend to think of this

00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:03,700
more as the human microbiome there are

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,319
more of them than there are of us and

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,620
things change here at an astonishing

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,939
rate and there are a huge number of them

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:19,489
in Motion's and the things that we did

00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:22,609
for VMs don't scale here we can't deal

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,370
with the kinds of problems and pain that

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:26,900
we had playing games of overlays

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,349
smearing subnets across multiple servers

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,709
it just doesn't scale and it ties you up

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:35,959
in things as a developer that you don't

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,220
want to know anything about quick show

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,900
of hands for the DevOps people in the

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,159
room how many of you really want to

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:46,040
think about subnets that is a miraculous

00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,659
zero I was thinking at least one of you

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,629
would take perverse pleasure in

00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:55,699
understanding subnetting okay excellent

00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:58,970
so I spent a lot of time thinking about

00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:00,199
where this divide originates and a lot

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,209
of it comes down to the fact that it's

00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,889
networking people we have really cool

00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,379
tools that we have spent a lot of time

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:12,650
falling in love with you know we have

00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:13,659
subnets we've ipam we have ACLs we've

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,909
VPNs

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:18,739
we have load balancers we have all these

00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:21,259
cool toys and we would really love for

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:23,000
you to love them too but again quick

00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,380
show of hands with the possible

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,180
exception of load balancers because they

00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,010
do things that you recognize how many of

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,719
you feel affection is DevOps people for

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,639
these particular tools

00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:39,559
and again oh wait we have one thank you

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:40,939
excellent Oh two two excellent but

00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:44,229
what's happening and what we're seeing

00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:46,489
emerge as we move to micro-services is

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:48,860
that we actually are dealing more at the

00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:51,889
level of concepts these are the ideas

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,049
that actually do something for you as an

00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,479
application developer and there aren't

00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:59,389
nearly as many of them and they're

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,269
easier to wrap your head around so the

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:04,249
first one is reach ability and isolation

00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:06,589
so quick show of hands of DevOps people

00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:09,169
how many of you care about your micro

00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:12,050
services either being able to reach your

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,279
other micro services or be isolated from

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,039
micro services who shouldn't be allowed

00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,929
to talk to them yeah I think that's all

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,439
the DevOps people in the room so good we

00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:23,899
have a concept that you care about and

00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:26,749
the second one is service discovery and

00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:29,239
routing because these micro services are

00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:31,069
coming and going so quickly you need

00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:33,219
some way to figure out where the hell

00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:36,499
the micro service you care about is and

00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:38,209
get the communications you need route

00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:40,159
into it from your other micro services

00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:42,679
and from the outside world so again

00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:45,019
quick show of hands how many people in

00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:47,259
the DevOps world care about this care

00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:50,179
about service discovery and routing

00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:52,639
awesome I was going to be very confused

00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:57,079
otherwise never a good thing when you're

00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:00,139
on stage so the other thing that I find

00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:03,169
is there are often concepts that exist

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:05,569
both of the networking world and in the

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:07,339
DevOps world but we have entirely

00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:09,169
different names about before them we

00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:11,869
think somewhat differently about them

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:14,719
and so we talk straight past each other

00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:17,239
so you guys care about service discovery

00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:19,699
and routing on the networking side of

00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:21,860
the house we figured out this style of

00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,569
problem as being something we cared

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:29,179
about 15 20 years ago we call it

00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,009
identifier locators separation and for

00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:33,050
us because we usually are working at l3

00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,969
we're usually working with IP addresses

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,649
it's the notion that you have an IP

00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:38,719
address that identifies something that

00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,789
you want to communicate with and a

00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:43,249
different IP address that allows you to

00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:45,649
locate it in the network because network

00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:49,039
our vast and huge and finding things is

00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:51,349
trickier than you would think and we

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,269
have mechanisms for allowing us to take

00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:55,449
these identifiers and get them to the

00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:59,479
proper locators

00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:02,059
so as I'm closing because as I mentioned

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,529
I have five minutes I'd like to continue

00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:04,909
this conversation somewhere this is

00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,949
where we get to the really experimental

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:07,909
part of today so really quickly with the

00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:10,219
networking people raise their hands

00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:12,799
again excellent

00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:14,869
so DevOps people look around the room

00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:18,889
it's amazing how behind sol went down

00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:22,249
keep them up keep them up so DevOps

00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:24,889
people look around the room find a

00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:26,449
networked person for after this keynote

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:30,799
and go talk to them because here's the

00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:32,389
really interesting thing everything you

00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:34,729
build is completely uninteresting

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,409
without the network and these are the

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:38,599
people who work day and night to make

00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:41,569
sure it stays up it is ubiquitous for

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,729
you and for the networking people the

00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:45,259
only reason we do what we do is to

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,360
support the applications that you as

00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:49,639
DevOps people are building in the

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,219
network and we need to be talking to

00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,379
each other more the days of talking past

00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:56,479
each other of overlaying over each other

00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,829
of thinking we can continue to move

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,209
forward with the same sorts of shiny

00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:01,339
baubles that we had on the networking

00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:03,259
side or that we can just ignore

00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,599
networking and just figure we have a

00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,589
single IP address on a single server we

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,899
can count on and we'll figure everything

00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:11,989
else out on the edge they're coming to a

00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:14,299
close because it doesn't scale and it

00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:15,769
doesn't work and what we have to do is

00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:18,169
come back to a hand in glove

00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:22,149
relationship much like what we had

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:24,330
before but at a much accelerated pace

00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:30,750
thank you very much

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,750
