	Lightning Keynote: Bridging the Divide: Bringing Network and DevOps People Together to Build a Unified Cloud Native Future - Ed Warnicke, Principal Engineer, Cisco

Network and DevOps people have historically thought about the world in very different ways. But neither group can succeed independently of each other. Networks without workloads developed and deployed by DevOps teams are pointless. Applications without networking are uninteresting and border on being useless. And neither group really understands the depths of each other’s domain. And the results, so far, have been less than optimal for everyone. Ed will share thoughts on simple ways we can come together to build a better cloud native future –  together.
