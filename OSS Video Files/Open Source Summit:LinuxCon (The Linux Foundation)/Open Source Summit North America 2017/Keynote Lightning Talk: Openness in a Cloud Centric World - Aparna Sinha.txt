hi good morning I lead product for

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,250
kubernetes which is an open-source

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,950
project and a commercial product from

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,320
Google Cloud and I want to talk to you

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,480
about why open source software is

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,109
important to the public cloud in

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,199
particular so openness is not a new

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:27,029
concept it was a key design principle

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:30,390
for the internet in 1974 when Vint Cerf

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,980
who now works at Google published this

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,640
description of the Internet

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,590
he said that tcp/ip on which the

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,219
Internet is based was going to be

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,829
available to anyone anytime without

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,820
barriers and they didn't take any

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:51,210
patents or IP this commitment to

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,520
openness really opened up a whole new

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,890
world of interconnection on which Google

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,420
is based and from which you and I

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,539
benefit through the exchange of ideas

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:06,090
information and photos and videos

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:08,580
through the open Internet the decision

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,220
to make the Internet based on open

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,560
standards were fundamental to making it

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,650
available universally and we believe

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,290
that a similar open openness decision

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,880
will lead to the universalness

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,680
of the public in the public cloud so

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,170
there are millions of open source

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,549
projects not all of them are super

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:37,950
successful the real question is which

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:42,180
projects matter here are some

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,570
observations that we've made on making

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,939
projects that matter

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:54,240
number one is openness that means that

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:58,579
you're both giving and receiving code

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,659
and ideas this isn't easy to do

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:04,049
particularly if you have strong

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,810
engineers but ultimately taking ideas

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:11,970
and sharing yours makes the whole

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:14,700
stronger second is actually freedom

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,280
so if you're holding the trademark or

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,870
some set of patents back that usually

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,110
does not create the most successful

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,400
project and then the really hard parts

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,380
which are fostering an ecosystem and

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,160
creating a diverse and thriving

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,280
open-source community so the project

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,660
that I work on kubernetes we think is on

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,460
the way to becoming one of these

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,800
successful projects and why is that so

00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,750
it provides a useful technology it does

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,700
something that essentially it's a tool

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,280
for managing clusters of containers

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,560
across multiple VMs or across multiple

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,650
host machines and that's useful and

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,920
Google has a lot of experience doing

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,470
that technically but really what's made

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,030
kubernetes successful so far is the fact

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,250
that it not just runs on Google's cloud

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,090
but it runs anywhere it can run on your

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,940
laptop

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,170
it runs on other public clouds it runs

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:16,260
on premises in private data centers so

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,390
that's critical to its adoption but I

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,120
think the most important piece is that

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,910
kubernetes has developed an open

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:29,580
community that has broad industry

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:33,420
support so what are the steps that we

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:37,800
took to creating such a ecosystem number

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:41,220
one we open sourced kubernetes separated

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,050
it from Google and gave the trademark to

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,760
an open source foundation the cloud

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:49,950
native compute foundation the CNC F also

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,660
we worked as a community to organize the

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,840
distributed technical decision-making

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,970
structure so the community is divided up

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,550
into special interest groups each of

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,550
which is a combination of multiple

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:05,220
companies that make technical decisions

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,989
so there's no one company or one or two

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,680
set of companies that are in charge and

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:12,900
that really opens us up to new ideas new

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,040
ideas can come from individuals they can

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,950
come from anywhere in the world

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,479
and lastly governance which is something

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:24,120
that's an ongoing piece for us it really

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,320
requires a lot of work each of these

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,990
pieces

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,100
governance development processes IP

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:36,060
management they're not done with central

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,510
control they're done as a group and in

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,520
the open an example of this is the

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,990
kubernetes conformance and certification

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,530
program which is something that we're

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,570
working on currently why is this

00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,000
important

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:54,150
so users rely on kubernetes to work on

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,610
any of these clouds today it's a very

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,260
popular product a very popular

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,980
open-source project with 50-plus

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,500
distributions how do we make sure that a

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,040
user can find a distribution that's

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,150
going to work across clouds and across

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,850
other distributions

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,170
that's what conformance is about it's

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,900
essentially the community getting

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,560
together to develop a test suite that

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,840
anyone can self certify against a vendor

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,840
can certify their distribution and a

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,090
user can use the test suite to know if

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,640
their code will run on kubernetes

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,220
anywhere and it's backed up by a

00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:38,030
certification mark that the CNC F owns

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:40,650
and will enforce ultimately we're

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,900
putting forth conformance to ensure that

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,020
the project has longevity and that it is

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,590
portable so that there's not one company

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:53,850
but many that control and support the

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,920
code so you know users will really

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,720
benefit in a multi cloud world I think

00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,340
you can all see that because they'll

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,700
have choice and they can run their code

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,560
anywhere they want but at Google we

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,970
believe that actually the public cloud

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,310
itself will benefit from openness and in

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,370
fact the collaboration and the freedom

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,100
that openness brings is what will

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,470
ultimately unlock the full potential of

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,240
public cloud much as it has done for the

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,040
Internet

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:29,549
thank you

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,549
