	Introduction to HyperBus Memory Devices - Vignesh Raghavendra, Texas Instruments

HyperBus is a high performance 8-bit Double Data Rate bus used to connect SoCs with high performance flash devices. HyperFlash is a NOR based, Common Flash Interface (CFI) compliant HyperBus memory device. Itâ€™s increasingly replacing Parallel flashes due to faster boot time and reduced pin count. In this presentation, Vignesh will talk about the HyperBus framework he introduced recently in the Linux kernel under Memory Technology Devices (MTD) subsystem and how it supports HyperBus memory devices like HyperFlash.
The presentation introduces HyperBus protocol, CFI specification, HyperFlash and their kernel framework. It also provides an overview of how to write a new HyperBus Memory Controller Driver.
Finally the presentation talks about improvements made to CFI framework to reuse existing code in supporting HyperFlash and the challenges and problems that still need to be addressed.
