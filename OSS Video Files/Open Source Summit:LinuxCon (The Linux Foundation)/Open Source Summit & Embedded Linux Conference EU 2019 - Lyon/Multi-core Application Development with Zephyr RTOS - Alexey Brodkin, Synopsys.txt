	Multi-core Application Development with Zephyr RTOS - Alexey Brodkin, Synopsys*

Performance in Desktop, Server, HPC and even smartphone applications has been scaling rapidly in recent years via multi-core, continuously increasing the number of cores on a processor chip. The same principle has been extending to embedded systems, where multi-core designs are increasingly more pervasive in applications such as 5G data processor, edge IoT, Machine Learning and many more.

This presentation will examine multi-core application options and considerations using the Zephyr. We'll start from exploration of use-cases where multiple CPU cores might be beneficial for deeply embedded system including both asymmetric & symmetric multiprocessing (AMP & SMP). Then we'll discuss current state of multi-core support in Zephyr: what is already implemented and what's still missing. And in the end we will highlight challenges associated with designing high performance software applications for multi-core hardware using samples on boards currently supported in upstream Zephyr project.
