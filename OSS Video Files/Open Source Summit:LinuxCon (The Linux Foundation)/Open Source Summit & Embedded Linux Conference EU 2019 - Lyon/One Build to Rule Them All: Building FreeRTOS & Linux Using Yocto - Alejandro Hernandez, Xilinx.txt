	One Build to Rule Them All: Building FreeRTOS & Linux Using Yocto - Alejandro Hernandez, Xilinx

Systems with a mix of architectures on a single device are commonly found on embedded products nowadays, where each processor provides different functionality; allowing developers to achieve great performance, while minimizing power consumption and cost.
Where Linux can excel at providing driver compatibility, community support and availability of software packages, an RTOS such as FreeRTOS might be ideal to make important decisions guaranteeing maximum time to perform critical operations whilst requiring a smaller footprint.

Since both operating systems might be used on a single product, a single workflow to develop applications for them would be ideal, this talk will cover how, by using a meta-freertos layer and OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project, applications can be created (and tested) via classes and recipes for both FreeRTOS and Embedded Linux, along with the toolchain and an SDK.

To showcase its usage, a sample FreeRTOS application built with the Yocto Project will be executed on QEMU during the talk.
