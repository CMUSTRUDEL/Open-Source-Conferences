hi everybody thanks very much for having

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,460
us here today I need to start with a

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,290
confession until about two years ago I

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,929
didn't even know what open-source

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,240
software or open data was and now Here I

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,480
am standing here talking to all of you

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,520
who are experts in precisely that but

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,619
what I can say that I know a fair amount

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,539
about is sustainability and more

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,000
specifically sustainability in the

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,740
fashion industry so as you heard my name

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,630
is Katie and I'm one-half of a team

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,940
leading the stakeholder engagement for a

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,730
massive open-source project that is

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,100
starting to revolutionize the apparel

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,809
industry and together with Deb I'm going

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,550
to talk to you today about how that's

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,870
fundamentally changing lives and

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,149
conditions for some of the most

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,390
vulnerable people in apparel supply

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,579
chains before Doug talks you through

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,140
what the open apparel registry is I'm

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,300
gonna give you frankly a fairly

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,120
depressing overview of the current state

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,949
of the global fashion industry and I

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,770
want to stress that this isn't about

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,719
high fashion if you wear clothes and

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,840
looking up at you all now I'm relieved

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:11,850
to say that you do these issues affect

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,740
you to start with some context according

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,930
to fashion United the global fashion

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,850
industry is worth three trillion US

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,280
dollars or two percent of the world's

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,990
GDP

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,729
globally the industry employs sixty

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,990
million people throughout the value

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:32,100
chain 80% of those garment workers are

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,780
women aged between 18 and 35 many of

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,610
those women have children and families

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,340
to support and quite often they are the

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,409
main income earner but rights for those

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,439
workers are frequently limited and

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:47,130
verbal physical and sexual abuse arise

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:51,390
in addition to that slave bonded and

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,790
child labor a commonplace but fashions

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,640
also an industry that exhibits enormous

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,619
income disparity with two of the Forbes

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,290
top ten wealthiest people in the world

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,180
being fashion industry leaders so on the

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,310
slide you can see Bernard Arnold who's

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,849
the chairman and chief exec of LVMH

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,160
which is a global fashion brand which

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,890
owns brands including Dior Givenchy and

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,230
Louis Vuitton and on the flip side he

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,120
can see Amancio Ortega who arguably

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,490
invented fast fashion through the

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,319
creation of his brand Zara which is part

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,560
of what's gone on to become the Inditex

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,959
group but at the other end of the scale

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,209
you've got thousands of workers toiling

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,580
away in garment factories adding to the

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,470
wealth of that industry elite and these

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,209
people aren't even earning a minimum

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,459
wage let alone a living wage so we've

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,170
touched briefly on wealth disparity and

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,569
the lack of living wages for workers and

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,550
garment supply chains but sadly these

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:51,780
aren't the only issues affecting the

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,730
industry many people in the audience may

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,940
recognize this tragic moment in history

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,670
the 23rd of April 2013 when the Rana

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,250
Plaza building in Dhaka Bangladesh

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,650
collapsed killing over 1,100 people

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,820
working inside that building and killing

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,860
over an injuring over 2,500 more those

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,550
people were garment workers creating

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,750
products for major global fashion brands

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,940
but on the morning that the building

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,739
collapse workers had spotted cracks in

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,959
the walls and expressed concern about

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,640
going into the building but those

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,260
workers were told by their managers but

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,549
if they didn't go into work they

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,030
wouldn't just lose their salary for that

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:33,000
day they'd lose their jobs with little

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,860
alternative fearful but desperate the

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,600
majority of those workers entered the

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,260
building that day but with horrific

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,480
consequences and all of this in order to

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,459
meet impossibly tight turnarounds that

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,650
are imposed by global fashion brands on

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:52,260
factories to feed our appetite for fast

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:54,390
fashion but the issues in fashion aren't

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,310
solely social and actually it's an

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,549
industry that wreaks environmental havoc

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,530
on the planet as an industry loads of

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,540
stages of production are dependent on

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,810
heavily chemically intensive processes

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,640
for dyeing and the finishing of products

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,380
not only does this affect the health of

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,540
workers who are handling those chemicals

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,450
but it also has impacts on water waves

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,310
and local ecosystems and often with

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,169
those waterways that's where people who

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,840
live locally to those garment facilities

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,610
are going they're going to use the water

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,620
there for their washing but also they're

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,889
sourcing water from those from those

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,219
river ways too

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:33,999
cook and drink so how has this been

00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:36,189
allowed to happen global fashion supply

00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:38,020
chains are incredibly complex and quite

00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:41,050
often pretty murky for a variety of

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,150
different reasons creating an item of

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,389
clothing isn't as simple as it's often

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,460
low-cost implies that made in Vietnam

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,340
label in your t-shirt is just telling

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,169
one part of the story where you're where

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,749
that t-shirt was finally cut and sewn

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,120
think of all of the steps before that

00:04:55,749 --> 00:05:00,340
where was the cotton grown and by whom

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,870
how did that cotton get from the farm to

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,460
the Jinnah and the spinner and that's

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,949
the place where the yarn where the yarn

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,500
is spun and the fabrics produced who

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:10,210
what what processes went into the dyeing

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,009
and the finishing treatment what about

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,020
the patent cutting and stitching it all

00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:16,569
together who did that and what about the

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,669
buttons where did they come from who fix

00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:20,699
that's shiny piece of embellishment onto

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,020
your on to the chest of your shirt and

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,520
then there's the care labels and the

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,919
brand labels that have to be stitched

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,449
into the net who did that work and if

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,699
your shirt looked nicely ironed when you

00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:33,669
bought it chances are that happened in a

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,039
different Factory as well so I think you

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,990
get the impression that creating fashion

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,169
in and of itself is a pretty complex

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,879
process and then throw in buyers from

00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,889
global fashion brands who have been set

00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,379
challenging targets to consistently

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,180
secure lower prices and you're left with

00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:51,279
our globalized fashion system we're

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,080
producing one simple t-shirt can involve

00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,779
multiple shipments between multiple

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,250
different countries and then think about

00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,990
all those steps that were involved in

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,020
producing that one simple t-shirt and

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,550
remember this that's just one item in

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,529
the inventory of brands that are

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,180
producing thousands upon thousands of

00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:11,259
products around the world every week

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,509
when you're dealing with that many

00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:15,610
layers keeping track of data in your

00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,949
supply chain as seemingly simple as name

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,129
and address it becomes incredibly

00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,930
challenging and what we found in

00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:24,699
building that open apparel registry is

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,620
that as basic a level as name and

00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:30,039
address information the quality of data

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,080
in the apparel industry is poor we hear

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,879
stories of auditors turning up at the

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,199
same factories two days in a row

00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,300
thinking that they're going to a

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,949
different place and we've also heard

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,270
stories of improvement programs being

00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,000
run twice in the

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,490
same facilities and as you can see from

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,380
the from the examples on this slide some

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,090
brands think that Athens is in the UK

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:54,070
and that Haiphong is apparently in India

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,810
so what is the open apparel registry and

00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:59,610
how can it help I'm gonna hand over to

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:02,680
Deb now who will talk you through that

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,600
thank you so now that you're thoroughly

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,180
depressed and concerned about ever

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,160
buying a t-shirt again I'm here to talk

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,340
about how the OER is working to improve

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,710
the situation so what is the oer we are

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,960
a neutral open-source tool for mapping

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,480
garment facilities worldwide and

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,480
assigning a unique ID number to each of

00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,790
them at the most basic level you can't

00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,890
fix a problem if you don't know where

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,310
your factories are and if you aren't

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:32,080
able to identify them in a single way so

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,700
let's listen to a brief overview about

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,090
what we're trying to accomplish with the

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,090
oer

00:07:41,020 --> 00:08:31,149
[Music]

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,149
[Applause]

00:08:32,059 --> 00:09:01,799
[Music]

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,799
[Applause]

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:08,409
[Music]

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,839
so what does the oer do at its core it

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,269
is a data project our goal is to create

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,829
a single registry that is fed by

00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:24,230
databases from lots of different

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:25,490
organizations and to apply an

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,890
industry-specific

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,600
ID number to each facility this would

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,910
eliminate issues with inconsistent

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,220
matching across databases and when it

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,860
enable in facility collaboration so that

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,380
we're not having these repetitious

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,230
audits that Katie was just describing so

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,250
what does that unique ID number look for

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,709
essentially we're not replacing any

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,630
other ID systems we are creating a

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:49,040
central source of truth that has

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,470
different components so we have a

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,329
country ID we have an origin date which

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,550
is when the facility was added to the

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,949
OER we have a general idea and then a

00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,360
check ID and at this point we are

00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,190
talking about data that's coming from

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,860
literally hundreds of different sources

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,170
brands multi-stakeholder initiatives

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,370
civil society organizations lots of

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,020
different groups so there's a lot of

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,360
data that needs to be matched

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,220
so that's super simple right like no big

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,920
deal we can map supply chains across the

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,750
global economy no problem obviously

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,070
there's some technical challenges and I

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,260
want to focus on two that we've

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,930
specifically solved using open source

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,820
software so first of all we have an

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,399
issue with the data because it's always

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,080
data as a project manager if I see a

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,540
project come in that involves data

00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,820
particularly publicly contributed data I

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,320
automatically double our the estimate of

00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,020
the time we're going to spend on it

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,600
data is complicated so we have in this

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,520
situation data that's coming from low

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,980
tech contributors there's no

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,589
industry-wide standards often the data

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,410
has been extracted from PDFs and then

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,570
run through OCR so it's super messy and

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,339
that's on top of all of the normal data

00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,230
issues such as transliteration

00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,990
non-structured addresses and

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,200
international character sets this is a

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,149
great example this is you know over ten

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,980
different ways of referring to what we

00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,959
think is the same facility with slight

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,360
derivations in the address and in the

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,459
name what makes that the situation more

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,160
complex is that in the apparel industry

00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:18,380
you may have facilities that are at the

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,660
same address but on different floors and

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,120
considered different facilities they may

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,100
even have a name that's very remarkably

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,160
similar but they need to be treated as

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,990
two separate entities so matching all of

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,870
these disparate pieces of data is very

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,029
challenging here's a great example let's

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,910
say we have 50,000 facilities in the OER

00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:41,089
a brand wants to upload a list of 5,000

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,529
that would be 250 million comparisons if

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,529
we're checking on a one-to-one scale

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,810
that could take up to seven hours in

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:49,790
2019 seven hours for data calculation is

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,000
not acceptable we needed to find a

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,399
shortcut our solution was to use D dupe

00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,410
which is an open source Python library

00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,270
for accurate and scalable fuzzy matching

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,060
record deduplication and entity

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,620
resolution I'm giving the very broadest

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,800
overview and I would highly recommend

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,240
checking out the project on github

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,220
essentially rather than having to check

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,589
each individual character against

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,570
another individual character you define

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:17,000
groups of data into something called a

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,800
block those blocks share very similar

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,329
characteristics and then can be compared

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,280
to each other so there's fewer

00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,830
comparisons with greater confidence

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,050
this has taken us from seven hours to

00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,570
less than four minutes and honestly it's

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,220
way less than four minutes but I'm a

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,960
project manager so I like to under

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,960
promise and over deliver so we'll go

00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,810
with four minutes what's our other main

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,700
technical issue it's the map as a BIA is

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,140
a geospatial software firm maps are our

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,330
bread and butter but we had some unique

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,220
constraints in this issue first of all

00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,930
we had to use a Google base map because

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,270
we were using a Google geo coder that

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,830
locked us into certain technologies that

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,960
made it more challenging to display

00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,030
certain items on the map but we had a

00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,560
lot of user feedback that they really

00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,960
wanted to be able to view all facilities

00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,660
at once so initially we were only

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,820
displaying 500 facilities on the map but

00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,860
when you have thousands of facilities in

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,480
Bangladesh or China alone that that's

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,580
not acceptable you need to be able to

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,500
see everything at once but we can't

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,210
sacrifice performance and we have a

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,160
limited budget and then there's the

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,740
sticky issue of geopolitical boundaries

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,210
we're putting a dot on the map is not

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,270
quite so simple when you're talking

00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:24,500
about shifting Geographic stances so

00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,720
this is what it used to look like

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,460
pretty standard clusters but again we

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,990
were limited to 500 and we were getting

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,930
feedback that that just was not going to

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,850
work so our solution was to implement

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,460
vector tiles has anybody worked with

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,960
vector tiles here before oh not a

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,150
mapping crowd okay you should check them

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,339
out they're really cool essentially it's

00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,230
support for serving web map images very

00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,990
quickly we're features are styled on the

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,940
client we used a post gist function and

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,520
added a vector tile end point to our

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,670
django web application this allowed us

00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,230
to display literally tens of thousands

00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,780
of points and we can scale infinitely

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,150
essentially to be able to aggregate them

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,190
at low zoom levels implement them as a

00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,589
hex grid and then display them in a

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,990
variety of ways we chose circles with

00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:11,089
colors and sizes that change based on

00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,830
the density of the facilities based on

00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,080
user feedback but you could do any type

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,360
of shape if you want it and that's what

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,280
we get when we added that so this is our

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,589
pretty map that shows every facility

00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,780
that's in the OE R as you zoom in you

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:26,570
get to individual points but it allows

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,220
you to get a sense of where at scale a

00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:32,030
large amount of the apparel industry as

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,130
being is working so in summary the

00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,730
benefits of the oir is that we take this

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,019
data

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,230
it's coming from hundreds of different

00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:41,389
sources and create single identifier x'

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,190
for each facility that allow us to link

00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,620
things so that data isn't in silos

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,360
anymore we have an API that will be able

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,550
to seamlessly push data through these

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,230
out through these systems to be able to

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,779
push back against some of these abuses

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,120
in the system so the oer has been live

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,230
for seven months now and in those seven

00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,959
months we've gotten some great feedback

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,940
about how already just with the limited

00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,550
number of information we have we've seen

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,620
great benefits to employees in the

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,940
apparel industry so to talk through some

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,720
of those case studies i'm going to turn

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:14,480
it back to katie yes as Deb said we're

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,459
already receiving amazing feedback about

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,589
how this seemingly really simple data

00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,839
and being able to see who's contributed

00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:22,820
that data it's actually changing lives

00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,800
of really vulnerable people in garment

00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,690
supply chains I'm going to talk you

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,279
through three brief case studies which

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,019
have come from an organization that

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,269
recognized the potential of the array

00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:34,399
are in our really early stages way back

00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:36,529
in beta the business and Human Rights

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,660
Resource Center and they're a global

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,670
organization that does phenomenal work

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,269
advocating for the rights of workers in

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,459
all kinds of supply chains earlier this

00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:49,160
year the be HRC responded to the

00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:50,930
dismissal of over 1,000 garment workers

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,690
who had been striking over the payment

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,699
of benefits in Cambodia they used the

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,380
AAR to identify the brands who were

00:15:55,699 --> 00:16:00,050
sourcing from the facilities that had

00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:02,240
sacked those workers two of those brands

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,980
responded and launched investigations

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,810
and through pressure from all different

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,000
quarters but including those brand

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:12,290
interventions the majority of those

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,620
workers got their jobs back moving on to

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:18,230
issues in Bangladesh where over 12,000

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,480
workers have been sacked and this was a

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,089
crackdown in response to nationwide wage

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,829
protests these protests were also met

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,510
with deadly police violence and they

00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:28,760
were over changes to the minimum wage

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,949
which has reached a level that experts

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,990
recommend isn't even half of what it

00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,519
should be but again although the

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,130
repression is ongoing through working

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,839
with the data in the array are the BHR

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,029
RC is able to continue to identify

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,160
brands that are associated with those

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:47,750
facilities and work with them as

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,300
developments unfold and lastly in

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,940
Mauritius earlier this year there was a

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,430
factory closure and the BARC again was

00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,260
able to use data from our tool to trace

00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,450
back to the brands after that factory

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,980
closure and it which was one that had

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,320
left a lot of Bangladeshi migrant

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,110
workers stranded and owed unpaid wages

00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,970
they reached out to the brands and went

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,730
on to work with a sauce and a local

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,740
trade union to ensure that some remedial

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,930
stats were taken and that included back

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,180
wages reemployment for some of those

00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,490
workers and repatriation talks with the

00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,170
Mauritian government and so even though

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,150
there's a lot more to be done in terms

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,370
of improving conditions in global supply

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,630
chains even these impacts that have been

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:30,770
achieved wouldn't have been possible

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:33,430
without the arrear so what next and how

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,430
can you all help

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,930
so the oer is an open source project and

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,600
there's a couple of ways that you as

00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,730
developers and other workers in this

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,470
industry can get involved first of all

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,120
maybe you don't put care about clothes

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,980
maybe clothes aren't your thing but

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,440
there's probably something else that is

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,290
your thing whether it's bicycles or

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,900
flowers or baby strollers or books or

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:59,060
something and there probably needs to be

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,220
transparency into the supply chain for

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,590
that item there is no reason you

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,720
couldn't fork the Oh a our cult code and

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,600
build it for another industry being an

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,310
ethical consumer in the 21st century

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,010
means thinking about where your stuff

00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,370
comes from not just buying it off of the

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,010
shelf

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,110
so our code is available on github if

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,760
clothes are your thing we welcome your

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,800
contributions there's a contributor

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,200
document there's a first good issue

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,640
label that you're welcome to use to kind

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,230
of focus where you're interested in

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,150
being involved and we welcome

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,160
contributions for the community we are a

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,990
very small project a handful of

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,820
developers some designers a project

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,530
manager but we would love to think

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,750
through how we can expand this project

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,100
to really get more results like the ones

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,690
we've seen in the case studies that

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,220
Katie described I'm going to talk about

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,230
consider your purchases and how you're

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,060
purchasing clothing and reusing it or

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,950
actually whether ownership is even

00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,340
necessary at all the outfit that I'm

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,740
wearing now is one that I've rented

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,750
search the AAR and discover who else's

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,360
discover who's participating in

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,179
transparent

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,980
initiatives the thing that's different

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,570
about the oír compared to the way that a

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,340
lot of brands are disclosing data at the

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,950
moment is that it means that the data

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,679
can be used in practical ways because

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:18,210
data locked away in PDFs it's just no

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,980
good to anyone really next contact

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,720
brands and manufacturers to encourage

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,940
them to share their supply chains you

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,220
can use your influence as customers here

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,260
we know from people that we work with in

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,600
this industry that enough that if enough

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,970
people ask brands who made my clothes

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,750
that question gets taken to board level

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,820
and c-suite level and finally educate

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,710
yourself on the issues there are loads

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,350
of really great resources out there now

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,630
whether that's books films documentaries

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,340
MOOCs that you can study come and ask me

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,730
afterwards if you're interested and I

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,650
can share my top tips with you and

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,720
lastly stay in touch and watch us

00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,450
continue to grow this is just the

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,789
beginning thank you thank you

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,789
