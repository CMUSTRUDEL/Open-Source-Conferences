	PMIC: First One to Turn On and Last One to Turn Off - Keerthy Jagadeesh, Texas Instruments*

PMIC stands for Power Management Integrated Circuits. Current day PMICs are pretty powerful and encompass multiple submomdules. The primary purpose is still to provide the voltage source for SoCs to power up. Several types of regulators are used to power up SoCs including SMPS, LDO, DC/DC converters. Apart from regulators PMICs generally have ADC, RTC & GPIOs.

The presentation aims to give an overview of PMIC driver development in linux and also give a thorough understanding on the PMIC debugging over i2c. The presentaion includes some of the complex issues that were debugged which were related to PMICs
on Texas Instruments DRA7 platform. The presentation gives general guidelines to be followed while writing a regulator driver, a brief overview of current state of regulator framework and how to avoid potential issues related to regulators.
