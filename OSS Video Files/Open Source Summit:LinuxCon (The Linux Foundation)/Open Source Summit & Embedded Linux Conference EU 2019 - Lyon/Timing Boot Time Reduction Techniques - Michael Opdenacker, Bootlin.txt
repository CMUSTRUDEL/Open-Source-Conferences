	Timing Boot Time Reduction Techniques - Michael Opdenacker, Bootlin

During this talk, Michael will describe the most helpful techniques to reduce the boot time of embedded Linux systems, together with recent measures of the corresponding savings they bring, such as toolchain options, kernel compression options, kernel command line parameters, eliminating unnecessary copying in the bootloader, optimizing storage performance and understanding and using U-Boot's Falcon mode. Michael will also show tools to identify parts which can be eliminated (such as finding all the files not accessed during the boot sequence) or optimized.

Last but not least, time is relative to space as we all know. This aspect of the equation will also matter.
