	Xvisor: Embedded Hypervisor for RISC-V - Anup Patel, Western Digital

Xvisor is an open-source type-1 monolithic hypervisor. It is primarily designed and developed for embedded systems. The Xvisor project has been around for more than 8 years now and it is has a mature/stable code base. It supports ARM, RISC-V, and x86_64 architectures. In RISC-V ecosystem, Xvisor is the first open-source hypervisor ported successfully to RISC-V architecture. In this talk, we explain RISC-V hypervisor extensions, Xvisor RISC-V internals and Benefits of Xvisor RISC-V (such as memory footprint, overheads, etc).
