Description: 
	Keynote: The Rise of DevSecOps - Yvonne Wassenaar, Chief Executive Officer, Puppet

We always value this notion that technology makes our lives easier. We love open source because it democratizes the creation and use of software. But as community members, developers and consumers, we know technology also can increasingly conspire against us.  

Case and point, Snyk just revealed that there’s been an 88% increase in application library vulnerabilities over two years - imagine what it will be in five? According to a Forrester, 58% of enterprise organizations suffered a breach at least once in the previous year, and over 41% of those external breaches exploited some software vulnerability. These stats only touch on the security challenges we face today. No one wants to make the headline news for a security incident - particularly one that could have been avoided. No longer can companies or developers view security as an afterthought. Security snafus can lead to huge costs and major reputation blows and you have a role in ensuring they don’t. The question is in the ever-changing technology environment we live in, how will you do that?

The answer is through maturing your DevOps practices (or moving to what some are increasingly calling DevSecOps). Whatever the name, the need for security integration to be a deeper part of any team is as, if not more, essential than the ability to deliver features quickly. The good news is as we’ve recently validated that in mature DevOps practices security is inherent and DevOps practices promote better security posture. Don't be left behind (or find yourself on the front pages for all the wrong reasons).

This keynote will address:

    The role that you have in ensuring the security posture for your company
    The important role that automation plays in setting the framework for DevOps (DevSecOps) and improving a company’s security profile.
    How to successfully evolve along your DevOps journey and inherently build in more security (along with the challenges you can expect along the way.

welcome I'm Yvonne I'm the CEO of puppet

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,400
and it is such a privilege to be here

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,610
today

00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,340
puppet has long been a huge believer in

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,070
open source in fact the founder of

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,109
puppet Luca nice he wrote the first code

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,320
of the puppet open-source project back

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:25,699
in 2005 four years before we were

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,250
actually founded as a company and it has

00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:31,859
continued to grow and scale over time we

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,520
have over 4,000 organizations that have

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,309
benefited from puppet technology we have

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,850
an amazing content repository called the

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,210
forge with over 6,000 open source

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,120
modules created by many folks likely out

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,469
here in the audience and beyond we have

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,930
over one hundred and sixty thousand

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,059
unique visitors to that we've also

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,370
started a lot of other interesting

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,539
open-source projects like bolts lira

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,859
wash we contribute upstream now to

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,650
Tecton in terms of some of our cloud

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,060
native offerings so it's been really

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,280
important to us to be part of this

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,270
community and thrilled to see it

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,030
continue to thrive from a what do we do

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,340
perspective there were a lot of hands

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,490
but a brief description I like to say we

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,930
eliminate soul-crushing work and we do

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,390
that through infrastructure automation

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,070
and integrating into environments to

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,530
take away the toil of having to do

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,060
everything manually but also to make

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,420
your environments more scalable and more

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,689
secure so that end we also created

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,939
something called the state of the DevOps

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,549
report we've been doing that for over

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,090
nine years thanks to many of you who've

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,439
contributed to that we have over 30,000

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,240
individuals who participate send in

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,250
their feedback and what I want to do

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,869
today is share with you some of the

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,740
highlights from the most recent survey

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,200
and really call to your attention that

00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,939
each and every one of you and all of us

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,930
collectively have a role to play in

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,189
security talk about why that's important

00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:08,640
and talk about what you can practically

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,200
tactically do and to kind of re

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,090
emphasize why it's important there was a

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,120
stat earlier ninety I think was 99% of

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,130
software contains open-source and we

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,170
just heard from IBM there's a lot of

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,560
places where we can be vulnerable so

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:25,960
let's talk about that hopefully many of

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,710
you recognize the headlines up on the

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,290
screen these are initially that we saw

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,470
these as you know wow I feel really bad

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,040
for the folks at Target but don't be

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,160
fooled

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,380
some Forrester research showed that 58%

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,530
of companies have had a date of breach

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,770
and 41% of those come from software

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,330
vulnerabilities so we're not as safe as

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,510
we think that we would be there's

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,400
British Airways t-mobile Facebook you

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,520
can go on and on and on but at the end

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,580
of the day there's many many folks who

00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,640
have now been impacted and the reality

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,410
is this cause folks a lot of money

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,250
so in target's case it was eighteen

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:13,270
point five million dollars in Equifax it

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,950
was 650 million and the list goes on and

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,930
on and that doesn't even start to

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,430
account for the brand's impact the

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,209
customer loyalty all of those other

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,480
challenges but even just the average

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,980
ransomware attack five million dollars

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,930
so the reason why people are starting to

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,459
get concerned about this is this could

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,900
cost a lot of money but it gets worse if

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,360
you think about it there's more types of

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,100
data most of the breaches today have

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,070
been about personal information about

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,450
security numbers and things like that

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,640
but if you think about it all different

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,950
types of data are being stored in all

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,340
different types of places and they're

00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:54,390
controlling more things they're driving

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,709
your cars they're managing your money

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,620
they're potentially dispensing the

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,989
medicines to your parents all of those

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,000
things imagine if a bad actor got in and

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,000
again we heard about all the places a is

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,860
gonna play a role so there's more at

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,959
risk so not only is there more

00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,360
technology more surface area for bad

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,140
actors but there's more impact that they

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,989
can have the other thing that's changed

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,539
is how software's are developed and I

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,729
believe all of these things are good

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,410
it's more democratized it's more

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,720
decentralized and it's increased

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,900
the open source and all of that is

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,400
fabulous but it does mess with security

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,590
because in the olden days we cared about

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,150
the perimeter we kind of thought it was

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,040
like our house like you put a lock on

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,770
the door you shut the windows and you're

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,270
safe we used to keep all of our software

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,790
in these data centers and we protected

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,490
the perimeter but we now realize that

00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,530
that is insufficient and it's causing us

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,290
to think about how do we actually keep

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,910
the world safe and I want to share with

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,310
you some stats on open source because I

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,680
think this is particularly relevant this

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,130
comes from our friends at sneaked an

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:07,150
open source security startup look at

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:10,350
these stats 88% growth and application

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,350
vulnerabilities in over two years

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,840
78% of those vulnerabilities were found

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,030
in indirect dependencies so we don't

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,220
always think about when we include a

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,240
call to an open source package what that

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,770
might be introducing into our ecosystem

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,160
37% of open source developers I'm sure

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,870
that's not any of you but 37% don't

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,590
include any type of security testing

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:38,100
during the CI process and 54% don't do

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,990
any docker image security screens

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,690
it's a median of two years from when a

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,930
vulnerability is found or added in an

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,930
open source package until it's fixed

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,000
that's a long time to be vulnerable and

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,310
companies all over the globe it was said

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,780
earlier 99% of software includes open

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,780
source this is scary

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,640
now coming from puppet I'm going to tell

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,640
you I believe automation and declarative

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,760
models are foundation to security if

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,350
they're not sufficient I do want to

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,050
point out that they are important I was

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:17,560
talking to a bank and they had a huge

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:20,200
amount of stability issues they did a

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,580
retrospective and they said don't write

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,540
this down so I didn't write it down but

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,750
I did remember it they said 80% of the

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,790
issues they had were human error it was

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,280
fat fingering it was failure to adhere

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,979
to policy it was not getting work done

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,450
in a critical amount of time and so what

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,599
they realized is they needed to automate

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,199
the environment to actually create

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,309
base level of foundation of not just

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,039
standardization and reliability but also

00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:50,069
security but that's far from sufficient

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,279
in terms of what we need to do and this

00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:56,520
is where the whole concept of DevOps has

00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,740
started to shift udev suck-ups so if we

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,199
think about it Waterfall broke down

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,879
because it was this cereal process it

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,819
took too long there were too many

00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,589
handoffs it was not gratifying to have

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,389
to wait months and months and months to

00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:13,020
see and get feedback on what you'd

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,580
written and that was all great but we

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,709
moved to DevOps and we moved to

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,959
containers or we moved to micro services

00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:20,729
to actually further improve and increase

00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,939
the ability that we can deliver feature

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:26,069
functionality to the marketplace but

00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,860
what we didn't account for necessarily

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:32,849
was security now this shouldn't surprise

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,680
anybody but this comes from IBM and if

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:38,369
you look at the cost of fixing defects

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,409
if you wait until implementation to find

00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:44,399
the defect it's six and a half times as

00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:46,229
expensive testing 15 if it's found after

00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,990
the fact it's a hundred times more

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:52,050
expensive so it starts to raise the

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,659
question if security really is this

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,329
important and it's this constantly to

00:07:54,659 --> 00:08:04,740
fix after the fact should we blend it in

00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:07,169
sooner so last year when we did the

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,559
devastate of the DevOps report we came

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,059
up with a five stages of evolution

00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:14,129
normalized standardized expansion

00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:17,699
automated delivery and then ultimately

00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,889
self-service if you look at it in the

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,459
final stages is when you start to see

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:25,680
companies integrating in security when

00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,409
they start looking at security policy

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,059
configurations being automated when you

00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,370
look at Incident Response being

00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:36,870
automated and when you look at security

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,439
teams being involved in the process what

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,810
we found not surprisingly this year is

00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:44,880
that in terms of the ability to have

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,939
high levels of security integration it

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,569
is in level four and five it is those

00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:52,670
most most sophisticated companies and

00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,560
organizations out there

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,710
and here are some of the things that

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,720
they're doing across the lifecycle from

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,610
a requirement standpoint actually

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,490
thinking about compliance and security

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,020
in the beginning during requirements

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,960
doing threat modeling as you work

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,870
through the design lots of areas in the

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,400
build process that you can do things

00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,350
from a testing standpoint from a

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,910
deployment so there's many different

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,760
areas where you can start to build

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:24,770
security in as part of the process and

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,720
break down those barriers now what we've

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,090
found what we went on we talked to folks

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,640
is that when you increase the level of

00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,920
collaboration you actually increase the

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,780
confidence in the security posture of a

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,690
company now what does that look like

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:44,870
well if we if we look at how mature

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,820
companies are companies that are level

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:50,360
four or five in terms of the maturity of

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,220
DevOps have a 2x time higher level of

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,950
confidence than level one on the

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,880
security posture in their company what

00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,680
are some of the things that they're

00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,750
doing

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,720
first and foremost they're actually

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,870
collaborating on threat models that's

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,620
key they're integrating security tools

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,690
in the integration pipeline they're

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,740
prioritizing security requirements in

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,720
the backlog they're understanding the

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,750
infrastructure related security policies

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,880
before deployment and they're actually

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,370
involving the security experts in the

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,920
automated tests so these are the things

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,220
that they're doing now that doesn't

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,950
necessarily mean they're more secure but

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,890
it is a mindset shift it is a breaking

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,360
down of the walls and the silos just

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,340
like we did between development and

00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:45,110
operations we're now doing that with

00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:47,240
security teams and unfortunately what we

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,970
found is just like when you go on the

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,670
DevOps journey itself security

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,050
integration is messy whenever you try

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,750
something new and you're trying to

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,210
change behaviors we talked about going

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,150
through what we like to say a j-curve

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:04,850
you get some quick early wins then it

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:06,090
starts to get more complex and then you

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,260
get the real benefit

00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:12,150
and we see that in the data we went out

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,210
we talked to security teams and

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:19,290
developers around the level of friction

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,940
and what you'll see is not surprisingly

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,160
people who don't integrate it all don't

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,560
see very much friction okay they're also

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,200
probably not very secure if you go to

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,480
the far end level five there's actually

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,790
they're the lowest amount of friction

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,860
perceived and it's in the middle section

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,850
where you see the greatest amount of

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,050
friction because that's where you're

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,940
just learning how to work together

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,530
you're learning how to integrate these

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:45,090
processes now why is there friction

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,650
let's go back to why we did DevOps it

00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,370
was to get feature functionality out

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:54,330
quicker and if we talked to respondents

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,550
the security slowed you down and I think

00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:00,240
that's been the big challenge all along

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:02,250
the security slowed you down and if you

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,240
look at the chart if you're not really

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,710
focused on it you don't really think

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,810
about it Security's not slowing you down

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,490
because you're not doing it and if you

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,050
go to the fully integrated side you've

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,660
kind of figured it out but in the middle

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,780
it's somewhat messy I'm here to tell you

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,060
as a CEO of a company that sells to

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,030
Fortune you know 1,000 companies around

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,940
the globe security matters my phone

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,610
rings if there's any issue and so when I

00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,950
talked to my engineering teams yes I

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,690
care about future functionality but I

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,310
also care about the security and the

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,960
ability that we can bring to our

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,620
customers to ensure that they're not at

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,670
risk particularly in this increasingly

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,050
challenging world when it comes to

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,910
cybersecurity so how are people doing

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,370
well if we look at it in terms of a

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,970
measure of remediation of critical

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:53,070
vulnerabilities we're doing okay if you

00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,900
look at the dark blue bar I know the

00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,360
numbers are a little bit small what

00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,060
you'll see is that level 5 DevOps

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,820
companies can actually remediated

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,650
honorabie letís in less than a day it's

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,020
a little actually say about half of the

00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,060
vulnerabilities and then it kind of

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,430
trails off over time so this is not

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,440
where we need it to be but it definitely

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,330
improves the ability to remediate the

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,950
vulnerabilities and hopefully there's

00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,950
fewer of them getting in to begin with

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:25,620
so in terms of integrating security it

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,779
does leave to positive outcomes it is an

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:31,290
important responsibility for all of us

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,670
to have and to take to heart but it's

00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,380
not going to come easily and so it's a

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,630
responsibility that we need to bring to

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,500
the table and bring forward in terms of

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,589
the work that we're doing so how do you

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,329
improve your security profile overall we

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,040
break it up into three key buckets this

00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,300
is mostly the infrastructure layer in

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,100
terms of how do you ensure you're

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,079
creating an automated environment that

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,779
ideally provides self-service from a

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,360
developer perspective how do you mature

00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,240
your DevOps practices and move to dev

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,089
sack ops and how do you remediating

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,970
honor abilities faster and on this last

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,950
point this isn't one simple answer in

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,320
today's world this typically is the

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,540
integration of your toolset in your

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,550
activities with other things in the

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,350
environment it can be anything from

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,589
integration with the security scanners

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,420
that you have to drive automated

00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:24,089
remediation it can be integration into

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,279
workflow tools like ServiceNow or to

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:28,110
Splunk or other tools like that but how

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,459
do you reduce that time because right

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,160
now the time to remediate

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,630
vulnerabilities if you already know

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,070
there's the vulnerability that's the

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,430
last thing you want to get hit on in

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,440
terms of a security breach so with that

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,260
I invite all of you to download our most

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,000
recent state of the DevOps report you

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,560
can find it for free on the puppet

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,560
website along with all the past reports

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,550
and if you have any questions I'll be

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,800
around for the rest of the conference

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,270
and look forward to seeing you thank you

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,990
so much
