	Bluetooth Mesh and Zephyr - Martin Woolley, Bluetooth SIG*

Bluetooth mesh was released in 2017 and allows secure networks of thousands of Bluetooth devices to be created. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) for radio communications and inherits its optimised, low power and other characteristics.

The Zephyr open source OS supports Bluetooth mesh on devices as affordable as the BBC micro:bit.

This session will explain the fundamental technical concepts of Bluetooth mesh, including models, messages, publish/subscribe, node composition and security keys and will explore whatâ€™s involved in implementing firmware that uses Bluetooth mesh on the Zephyr RTOS platform.
