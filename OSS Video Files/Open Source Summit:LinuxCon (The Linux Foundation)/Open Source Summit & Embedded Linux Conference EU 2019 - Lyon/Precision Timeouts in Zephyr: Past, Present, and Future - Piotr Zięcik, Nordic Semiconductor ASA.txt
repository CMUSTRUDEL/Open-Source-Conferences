	Precision Timeouts in Zephyr: Past, Present, and Future - Piotr Zięcik, Nordic Semiconductor ASA*

An operating system dedicated for embedded real-time applications must include precise timing infrastructure providing the same level of service regardless of the system load and state. In this session, Piotr Zięcik will give insight into Zephyr timing infrastructure and cover recent activities aimed to improve real-time capabilities of this operating system, as well as compare the achieved performance with real-world requirements. Piotr Zięcik will also present plans for long-term evolution of Zephyr timing infrastructure.
