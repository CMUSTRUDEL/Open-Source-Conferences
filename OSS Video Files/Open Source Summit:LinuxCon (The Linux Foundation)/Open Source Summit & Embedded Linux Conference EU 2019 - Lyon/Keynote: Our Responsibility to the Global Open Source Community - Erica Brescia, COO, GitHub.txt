Description: 
	Keynote: Our Responsibility to the Global Open Source Community - Erica Brescia, Chief Operating Officer, GitHub

As we all know, open source now powers much of the world and touches every aspect of our lives. Today's evolving geopolitical landscape is causing questions about the potential fragmentation of the open source community along national borders. We, as a community, cannot let this happen. I'll share a few ideas of what we can do to prevent this.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
thank you so much for being here

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,130
everyone I'm absolutely thrilled to be

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,570
in Lyon and have an opportunity to talk

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,059
to you about something that I'm

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,540
incredibly passionate about myself and

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,119
that's our responsibility as

00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:21,029
contributors and as leaders to the

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,480
global open-source community so with

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,769
that let's get started let me get my

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,840
clicker working okay I think this crowd

00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:33,180
among any other would understand that

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,300
like the world is powered by software

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,390
right it touches every aspect of our

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,309
lives from our phones to the planes that

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,730
we flew here in to the cars that we

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,960
drive and that most software today is

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,149
built on open source in fact 99% of

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,329
software projects are built on open

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,579
source I don't think that that will

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,010
surprise anybody here but I've been in

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,109
open source for over 15 years and I

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,809
don't think I really understood what

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,390
that meant until I dug a little bit

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,630
further into the numbers so that's what

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,390
I'm going to start with here today when

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,060
you import an open source library into

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,030
your project you're not just adding code

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,000
you're essentially adding a team of

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,150
developers to your project you're giving

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,700
them commit access to your code but with

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,490
that you get to benefit from the ongoing

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,619
work that they do to improve the

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,979
libraries that your software is

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:39,360
depending on this is the reality of

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:42,930
building on open source I think a lot of

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,180
people still have this image of the solo

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,479
developer you know the lone ranger

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,790
toiling away in a dark room maybe you

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,939
slide pizza or since we're in France

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,210
some crepes under the door and out comes

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,180
you know incredible software but in

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,240
reality we're this interconnected

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,700
community of developers software

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,129
development whether you're doing it you

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,670
know alone in a room at home or in a

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,950
company is deeply collaborative and this

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,860
morning I'm gonna tell you a story about

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,700
how thousands of software developers

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,720
came together to create a major

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:28,300
scientific breakthrough hopefully you've

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,730
all seen this picture by now I think

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,670
it's the photo seen around the world

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,180
it's the first ever picture of a black

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,030
hole now scientists had theorized about

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,400
black holes for years but we didn't have

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,709
any telescopes that were powerful enough

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,010
to see them and that's because they're

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:51,030
incredibly far away this particular

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:55,780
black hole is in a galaxy called m87

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:59,560
over 55 million light years away from us

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,950
here today and so it took scientists

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,160
years and a network of telescopes all

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:09,489
around the world to collect data that

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,180
then it took years to process to

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,519
actually produce this image and while

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,519
this is an incredibly cool image and an

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,600
important scientific moment I think this

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,400
is my favorite picture from that

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,730
hopefully you've seen this all is well

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,489
it's incredibly iconic and this is dr.

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,030
Cady Bauman one of the lead researchers

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:37,120
and scientists on the project I think we

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,160
all can identify with this moment it's

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,799
the moment where you finally get your

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,540
code to pass all the tests or if you're

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,150
in marketing when you see your designs

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:51,820
come to life for the first time it's

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:54,280
that moment of pure joy this project had

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,220
hundreds of people around the world on

00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,579
the core team working with Katie to make

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:03,609
this moment a reality but there were

00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,829
many other people that contributed to

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,200
the open source projects on when it was

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,840
built if you didn't know it was built on

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,299
Python and there might even be people in

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,000
the audience today here who worked on

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:20,769
some of the projects that made the event

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,650
horizon project possible we dug into the

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,260
number of community contributors that it

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,390
took to build all of the open sore

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,940
dependencies that were pulled in for

00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:37,480
event horizon and the number is

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:40,840
incredible over 21,000 people worked on

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,740
the software that made that picture of a

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,800
black hole possible there's no other way

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:52,390
to do this other than open source the

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,740
numbers are truly astonishing to me so

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,990
you know when we think about the

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,660
projects that we work on we often think

00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,980
just about the direct contributors who

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,740
are the people that you're working with

00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,400
on a daily basis to bring your project

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,920
to fruition but they're really all these

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,910
community contributors that can

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,890
contribute to making it a success so you

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,960
know you see the twenty one thousand

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,060
number from the event horizon project

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,760
and you know that it's built on Python

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,130
and I think it's easy to think hey maybe

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,530
that is some kind of an anomaly right

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,800
maybe it's just specific to that project

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,200
at github we're fortunate to have access

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,020
to a lot of data about the world's

00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,230
developers and so we decided to take a

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:42,460
look at the top thousand open-source

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:46,360
projects on github today and see how

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,940
many people did it take on average to

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,180
produce the top thousand open-source

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:58,240
projects and the number is just

00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:02,100
incredible 74,000 people on average

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,610
that's not the total across all projects

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:09,100
74,000 people contribute on average to

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,700
the top projects when you look at all of

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,220
these community contributions for me

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:18,250
again I've been an open source for most

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:22,270
of my career I would have never guessed

00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,430
that the number was that high and this

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:28,030
is bigger than the development teams at

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:30,400
Google or Apple or Microsoft in fact

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:35,410
it's bigger than the entire employee

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,870
basis of the global fortune 500 and that

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,660
really is the power of open-source you

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,460
could never get a team that big

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,560
every time we develop open-source

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,570
software we're standing on the shoulders

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,910
of all of the work that these people

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:50,910
have done to create the open-source

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:53,790
libraries that we depend on but where

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,800
are they coming from again at github we

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,350
have access to a lot of developer data

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,870
and we produce a report every year

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,780
called the state of the octave or the

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,640
octave erse excuse me and publish it the

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,300
next one is coming out in just a few

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,830
weeks so this is the 2018 data but I can

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,290
give you a sneak peak and tell you that

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:17,160
the trends continue and what I think is

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:20,250
really cool is that most open source

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,470
contributions and the growth of open

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,800
source is primarily happening outside of

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:29,880
the u.s. in fact 80% of all open source

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,400
contributions today come from outside of

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,600
the US and you can see that it's growing

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,420
more quickly as well we've also broken

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,120
this down on a country basis and you'll

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,160
see here the top two markets for open

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,050
source development outside of the US are

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,580
actually China and India and I know it

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,410
looks like they're flatlining but

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,760
remember that this is a chart about

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:59,400
growth so these markets although we have

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,830
millions of developers in them are

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,740
continuing to grow faster than any

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,530
others it's about 30 percent year over

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,420
year on average we don't currently break

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,370
out all the numbers but what I can tell

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,550
you is there are over 40 million

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,580
developers on the github platform today

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,480
so of course those markets represent

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,980
millions of developers each of them I

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,750
think charts are cool but what really

00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:31,170
made this hit home for me was this image

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,840
this is based on real data for a month

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:37,919
of contributions on github it's over a

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,919
hundred million contributions a month on

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,890
the github platform and each of those

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:47,160
little points of light represents one of

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,080
those contributions I have to say I

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,000
think it's pretty cool and I was proud

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,490
to work at github before but seeing this

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,140
graphic made me especially

00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:00,330
so but what would happen if we lost part

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,209
of that community you can see these

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,640
points of light are coming from

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:09,029
virtually everywhere in the world I

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,560
think we all read the news and we know

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:15,810
that we live in increasingly difficult

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,750
geopolitical times for those of you

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,920
especially who came from the US you know

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,870
that there are some some tough

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,260
relationships in China right now between

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:28,260
the US and China and Chinese developers

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,300
contribute to some of the most important

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,970
open-source projects that we use today

00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,880
of course Linux is one of them

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,730
but there are a number of others and I

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:43,260
would hate to see us lose access to all

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:45,750
these incredible developers and one of

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,420
my favorite things about open source is

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,450
the way that it enables us to meet and

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,420
collaborate with people that we wouldn't

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,890
have met otherwise in fact maybe some of

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,630
you know this but I met my husband

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,240
through open source when we were living

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,339
in totally different countries and it's

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,260
gonna be our eleven year anniversary in

00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:07,350
a couple weeks so happy Anniversary

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,860
honey wherever you are but I would have

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,380
never met him without open source and we

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,520
all need to make sure that we work

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:20,670
together to continue to maintain this

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,589
glorious global open source community

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,220
that I know we're all so happy to be a

00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:29,310
part of at github we're working on this

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,110
ourselves in a few different ways some

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,690
of you might be familiar with the recent

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,029
US trade sanctions and a lot of

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:39,870
companies just decided to geo block

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:43,800
access to their products for Iran and

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:46,020
Syria and Crimea at github we decided to

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,260
take a different approach and we have

00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,720
left all of our open source or publicly

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,240
available open source repositories

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,490
available to developers in those

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,820
countries and we're also working with

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:03,690
policy makers to expand access to github

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,360
to developers in those places we believe

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,350
that access to github and the global

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,310
open source

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,960
immunity is not only important for

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:16,320
continued software development but also

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:20,610
for the free flow of information with

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,970
developers around the world in China

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:27,390
we're actually investing in improving

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:30,210
access to github in China and working on

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,040
building out a team there again for

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,560
those of you familiar with US politics

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,870
it's a challenging time to do that but

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,940
we feel it's our duty and I think it's

00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,090
our duty as a group to make sure that we

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:45,240
continue to build bridges with

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:47,700
developers in places around the world so

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,800
I encourage you all to work with your

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,690
policymakers to make your voices heard

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,210
to make sure that we're all coming

00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,880
together to fight for developer freedom

00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:59,280
and access to the global open-source

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,440
community and I also encourage you to

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,300
make sure that you really understand the

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,130
policies that are being input in place

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,170
and you're not afraid to push on the

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,210
boundaries whenever possible again in

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:13,530
the pursuit of developer freedom and

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:16,500
access we are more connected than ever

00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:19,680
before and we need to make sure that we

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,270
work together to keep it that way let's

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:29,020
keep the lights on thank you

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:29,020
