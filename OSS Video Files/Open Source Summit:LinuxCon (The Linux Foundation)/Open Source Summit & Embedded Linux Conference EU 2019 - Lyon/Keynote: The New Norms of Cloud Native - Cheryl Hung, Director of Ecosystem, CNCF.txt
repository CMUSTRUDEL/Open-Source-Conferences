so good morning welcome to Leon I'm

00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,130
Cheryl I'm an ex-googler software

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,240
engineer and now director of ecosystem

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,179
at the cloud native computing foundation

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,730
so today I'd like to look at how

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,300
kubernetes has grown to be one of the

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,939
largest open-source projects today how

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,390
that success is changing expectations

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:32,820
around open source and what that means

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:36,030
for companies so the mission of the CN

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,050
CF is to foster and sustain open source

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,320
projects around cloud native the CNC F

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,969
hosts more than 40 projects of which the

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,930
largest and most well-known is

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:54,960
kubernetes kubernetes is where if not

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,809
unique in the open source world in that

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,989
it was defined very early on as both a

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,840
project and a community and there was a

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,939
very conscious effort to expand the

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,840
group of people who could be part of

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:12,540
that community so let's look at the

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:18,540
journey the kubernetes has taken since

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:21,570
joining the CN CF kubernetes is made up

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,860
of 1.1 million contributions on github

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:31,829
from 35,000 contributors for more than

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:34,009
2,000 contributing companies and these

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,270
contributions are getting more diverse

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,820
so Google and Red Hat's

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,250
the two highest contributors to

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,280
kubernetes have continued to increase

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,250
their contributions but their overall

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,979
percentage is shrinking as many other

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:55,170
companies are getting involved and the

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,020
contributions to kubernetes come from

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,070
dozens of countries and the geographic

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,259
diversity is increasing over time so it

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,719
backs up what Erika was just saying

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,390
about how important it is that we

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,430
continue to provide access and allow

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,970
people from across the globe to be

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,970
involved

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:20,550
so this graph shows the 30 highest

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,970
velocity open-source projects across

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,819
three axes so the x-axis is the number

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,220
of commits the y-axis is the number of

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,830
pull requests and issues and then the

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,420
size of the bubble reflects the number

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:39,270
of authors so kubernetes is the pink ish

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:45,780
bubble to the top middle and just to the

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:48,360
right and above that is Linux cube con

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,989
cloud native con continues to grow this

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,540
year 23,000 people expected to attend

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,900
across Yukon North America Europe and

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:03,600
China including 12,000 people in San

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:05,519
Diego next month and many big names have

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,660
successfully adopted cloud native

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:15,750
technologies at the same time this

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:19,049
success is setting new expectations the

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,410
first is the in cloud native open source

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,440
is the default one government agency

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,290
told me if we wanted to use open source

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,340
it would have taken six months to get

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,829
approval but all CN CF hosted projects

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:40,410
are automatically approved which makes

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:43,579
it really easy to adopt and as a result

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:47,190
cloud containers and cloud native

00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,940
computing expertise is very greatly in

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,510
demand

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,410
so one consultancy even asked me how do

00:03:51,510 --> 00:04:00,780
we find 75,000 engineers with kubernetes

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:03,660
experience I told them good luck so it's

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,390
actually in company's best interest to

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:12,329
be active and involved and engaged with

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:14,700
open source communities in this survey

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,850
it shows that large tech companies are

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,039
more likely to be actively encouraging

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,300
it through an open source program or

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:26,700
initiative and one company said to me if

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,499
we it's not an option for us not to do

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,300
open sore

00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:32,400
if we don't get involved with cloud

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,409
native and take the lead we're going to

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,419
fall behind our competitors so we'd like

00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:42,870
you to come with us on the next stage of

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:45,569
the journey and we'll be in San Diego

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,229
next month or in Amsterdam in March

00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:52,250
early next year these slides are at my

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:58,290
blog Oh she'll calm thank you very much

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,290
