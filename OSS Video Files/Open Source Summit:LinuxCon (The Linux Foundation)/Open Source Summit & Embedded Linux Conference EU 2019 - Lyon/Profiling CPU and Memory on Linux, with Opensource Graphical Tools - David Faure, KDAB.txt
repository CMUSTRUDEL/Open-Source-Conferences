	Profiling CPU and Memory on Linux, with Opensource Graphical Tools - David Faure, KDAB*

Finding out where you application is allocating memory, or where it's spending a lot of CPU time -- or even where it's waiting for something, has never been easier. KDAB has developed two opensource tools for this. The first one is heaptrack, for memory profiling. The second one is hotspot, for CPU (and off-CPU) profiling, based on the powerful perf tools from the Linux kernel.

The great benefit of heaptrack and hotspot is that they have been designed for application developers, who don't have to know all the internals of the Linux kernel just to profile their application.
They provide graphical representations that make it quick and easy to spot where the problem is.
