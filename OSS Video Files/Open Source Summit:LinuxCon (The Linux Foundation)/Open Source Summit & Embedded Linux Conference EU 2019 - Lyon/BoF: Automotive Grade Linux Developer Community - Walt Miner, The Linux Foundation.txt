Description: 
	BoF: Automotive Grade Linux Developer Community - Walt Miner, The Linux Foundation*

AGL provides an application framework with SMACK based security, a large number of micro services tailored for the automotive environment, and an SDK for app developers to get going quickly. AGL has attracted a large number of systems developers and app developers. This is an opportunity for developers to get together and discuss issues they have run into, potential roadmap ideas and to provide feedback to the community. Please bring your questions, comments and ideas to this session.

all right so it's six o'clock so it's

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,420
time to start my name is Walt miner I am

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:13,139
the community manager for automotive

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,759
grade Linux or what was it agile

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,600
government logistics whatever you want

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,070
to call AGL and what I'm going to do is

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,230
this is the birds of a feather session

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,670
so the way it works is I'm gonna go

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,529
through I don't know I've got about 10

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,359
or 15 slides real quick just to tell you

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,279
what AGL is and a little bit about our

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,279
community and then you're gonna get to

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,530
participate and ask me questions or even

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,820
better I'll throw the question to

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,430
somebody here who actually know

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,660
something unlike me and they'll answer

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,670
the question so that would be even

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,649
cooler so what is AGL basically we're an

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,110
open-source project hosted at the Linux

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,030
Foundation I'm an employee the Linux

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,660
Foundation and my colleague and so my

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,760
aunt Simone Mueller who was a is our the

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,800
AGL release manager he's also an

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,339
employee the Linux Foundation and we're

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,549
basically a neutral party among 155

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,159
members are so collaborating to create

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,130
the automotive software of the future

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,330
and we have a single codebase that we

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,070
call the AGL unified codebase it's

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,080
called unified codebase because of the

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,210
time we created it there were a bunch of

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,240
different automotive and non-automotive

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:31,229
software open-source components running

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,350
around from Tizen from Geneva from Yocto

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,700
and we took we're taking all of that

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,650
combining it with some open-source

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,630
components that we've built an AGL over

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,020
the last four or five years and that's

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,390
what we call a unified codebase

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,000
we have 11 different auto automotive

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,180
manufacturers that are participating and

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,159
supporting automotive-grade Linux this

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,869
just this past year we've had some

00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,360
important new members like Volkswagen

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:02,880
joined this year Ford rejoined and SAIC

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:08,009
the largest car manufacturer in China is

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,330
now a member we have like I said 155

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,680
total members so across the spectrum of

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,290
the automotive industry

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,689
ones like Panasonic and Denso and

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,549
continental tier twos like you know and

00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,849
sock vendors like Renaissance and Intel

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:28,920
and Qualcomm so a whole host of an

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,329
Amazon participates with their speech

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,760
recognition engine that are very

00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:36,269
familiar with I won't say her name

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,709
because she might go off so a really

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:42,389
good collection of companies that

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:45,299
participate we like to say that if if

00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:48,209
there's Linux in a car it should be

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,069
running automotive grade Linux and we're

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,500
the only organization the only open

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,419
source organization especially

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,629
addressing all the software in a car so

00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:00,659
we've already got with our UCB we've got

00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:03,959
profiles for infotainment for instrument

00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,930
cluster for telematics and connectivity

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,930
devices we're adding heads-up display

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,719
and as we move into the next year so

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,579
we'll be adding functional safety and

00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,579
then a TAS and autonomous driving

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:26,699
so the AGL unified code base basically

00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,709
there's one source tree that we build

00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,260
from to build all these different

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:36,359
devices for a number of different

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,959
reference platform or platforms our goal

00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:42,359
is to provide 70% of base platform for

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,099
production projects for your Tier one

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:48,389
suppliers and really open source is

00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,239
fairly new within the automotive

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,799
industry and collaboration on source

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,769
code is really new among the automotive

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,650
industry so really we're working to

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:02,519
cultivate an ecosystem of developers and

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:06,419
suppliers around open source all using

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,609
the single source code base we have all

00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,650
of our source code hgl is completely

00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:13,379
open and transparent I'm the community

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,079
manager we have open mailing lists

00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,090
anybody enjoying the AGL death community

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,799
mailing list I've got a list at the end

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,919
of these slides of a bunch of different

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,570
developer resources you can use all

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,260
these slides are already uploaded so you

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,150
don't have to go

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,370
take pictures or worry about hyperlinks

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,580
oh they're all the hyperlinks work as

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,560
far as I know so you can download all

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,080
the source code for the for the Apple

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,840
reference applications for the PSP's etc

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,040
it's all available on our get on our get

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:48,330
page just to show you the amount of

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,090
collaboration we've got this year in we

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,570
do a release every six months but twice

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,610
a year for one year we every year we

00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,720
pick a version of yato and we stick with

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:05,280
it this year we've been running 2.6 or a

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,970
thud and so our releases are named after

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,920
fish I think I've got a complete list of

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,510
all the fish names this year we released

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,770
our eighth our seventh and eighth

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:20,730
releases grumpy guppy and happy halibut

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:24,660
both of those running thud no that's not

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:28,200
true guppy was running Rocco a halibut a

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,690
nice fish we'll both run thud we've done

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,460
since we released grumpy guppy at the

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,650
beginning of the year we've released

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,750
four patch updates

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:43,320
it was security updates and kernel

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:45,450
upgrades we we released happy halibut in

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,200
July so that's where we switched from

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:52,740
Rocco to thud and we've done two patch

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,600
updates since then just about two weeks

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,580
ago was the last one and we'll continue

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,210
to do updates of that through the

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,540
beginning of next year probably probably

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:08,870
five patch releases possibly six depends

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:11,820
on how things go that middle line here

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,530
to show you I've got a slider that

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,420
addresses that but basically those are

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,390
all the opportunities we have for our

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,560
community to get together have a

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,080
face-to-face meeting among our

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:27,150
developers we had an all member meeting

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,340
last week in Monte Carlo so 120 people

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,230
120 developers got together and talked

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,140
about AGL and worked on source code

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,890
things like that for three days in Monte

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,890
Carlo last week

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:45,070
the this is probably an old slide but

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:47,470
the AGL architecture is microservices

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:51,870
based we have this binder binding

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:55,419
concept for adding new services to AGL

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:57,699
we use smack for security we're adding

00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:03,190
token logic for security as another

00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:05,590
security method as well just a quick

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,190
picture that shows at a high level how

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:12,700
that all works and there's a lot of

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:15,479
documentation site so you can go take a

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,850
look at all this this architecture we

00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,290
have binders available so we these are

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,200
basically buying to consider a binders a

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:26,860
collection of api's or a collection of

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:31,660
bindings for a whole bunch of different

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:36,810
areas home screen window manager audio a

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:39,400
lot of connectivity geolocation gps

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,990
media player so both automotive

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,200
functions and more of your standard

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,240
networking and functions like that all

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,250
of which are then provide for our we

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,620
have security provided by smack using

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,260
the AGL application framework so you

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,789
can't access these api's these bindings

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:59,979
unless you're unless you have the right

00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:02,760
permissions we've also got an XD s based

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:05,440
sdk that you can download you can

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,520
quickly get up and running you know you

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,099
can either start with the reference

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,560
applications we have or write your own

00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:13,389
you've got cute base that i should

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,419
change this html5 is not just planned

00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:22,150
html5 apps are now available using the

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:24,310
web app manager that we have so you can

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,740
basically download the applications and

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,710
be up and running in a pretty short time

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:31,360
there's a again there's another page in

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,310
our documentation site about how to

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,900
build your first application and and

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,930
download it and get it up and running on

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:47,310
a board or using the QQ mu and the

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:49,570
emulator so just a list of different

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,950
developer resources like how to get to

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,770
our wiki page where the

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,140
Morse code is we use JIRA for issue

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,870
tracking and for project management and

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:02,050
things like that you can go download you

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,930
can go grab tar balls or pre-built

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:09,960
binaries release notes are always

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:13,480
available on our wiki we use Garrett for

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:19,050
code reviews we use git of course for a

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:21,400
source code management and then we have

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,140
weekly developer call that I host on

00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,780
Tuesday morning of Tuesday morning us

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:29,650
times Tuesday afternoon in Europe

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,240
Tuesday evening in Asia you can always

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,550
are welcome to join that we used to get

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,480
about 30 to 35 people you can ask any

00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,880
question you want

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,620
we have an IRC channel where a lot of

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,740
folks hang out you can ask questions

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,110
there we have a deaf community mail list

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,960
that was recently moved over to groups

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,730
tayo so that's available as well so

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,670
there's all and we when we moved from

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,680
mailman to groups that I owe all of the

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,350
back history was ported over to groups

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,880
that I oh so it's a much nicer

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,140
searchable format so there's any

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,090
question you have you might be able to

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,240
find the answer right in there or you

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:09,040
can just post a new question to the to

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,320
the mail list into the topics and then

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,680
finally I'm trying to keep this part to

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,390
ten minutes we've got this is kind of

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,460
the list just to show you some of the of

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,360
the workshops that we've had this year

00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,490
we've had a lot of face-to-face

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,380
workshops we try to get together are

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,980
developing our developers together about

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,350
every two months or so we just had one

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,230
like I said in Monte Carlo last week we

00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,020
were in Berlin last month we had I think

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,410
thirty or thirty no we have 40 I'm sorry

00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,470
40 or 45 people show up in Berlin will

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,670
be allows you have some signage

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,520
simultaneous sessions in Karlsruhe

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,890
Germany and Yokohama Japan next month

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,340
and we'll be in San Francisco in

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:56,740
December all leading up to our big CES

00:10:51,340 --> 00:11:00,070
event in January in Las Vegas so with

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,030
that this is mostly a Bop session so

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,670
you're all supposed to come prepared

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,170
with questions and

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,150
supposed to have answers but I probably

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:09,100
won't have answers from other people

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:12,420
here so who has a question or who has

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,420
something they want to ask or talk about

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,650
otherwise we can just go to the bar oh

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,480
you want a leading photo I didn't give

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:30,250
you any questions this time okay yeah

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:40,540
okay there we go we got a question the

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:42,640
man in the man in yellow great Linux

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,550
project has been used in any industrial

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,030
project yet or industrial projects yeah

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:53,380
I mean like even a proof-of-concept was

00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:55,060
any OEM more so in a car yeah yeah in a

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,470
car yeah so industrial is kind of

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,170
another vertical but we have had

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,380
interest from from industrial companies

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,910
in looking at AGL Toyota has said that

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,890
there has announced that they're using

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,320
automotive grade Linux the earlier

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:11,620
version of it in the starting with the

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,510
2019 Toyota Camry and now with their

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,580
inlets in the rav4 and other vehicles as

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,340
well spreading into their Lexus lines

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,620
I think Mazda has said they're going to

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:26,580
use it and we've got other we have like

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:28,990
I said 11 different OEMs so expect that

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,510
we'll get more announcements from those

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:36,430
OEMs as we as we go forward for the next

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,690
couple of years the existing

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,450
implementations and vehicles are

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:44,100
infotainment yeah we this this year was

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:47,020
the earlier this year we released the

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,520
instrument cluster reference device we

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,620
have an instrument cluster of reference

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,890
group X pert group rather that meets

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,960
every two weeks

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,000
Suzuki hiroki-san from Suzuki leads that

00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,330
expert group there's been a lot of

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,080
interest from both om members and tier 1

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:09,700
members like Panasonic Denso Bosch

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:11,530
Continental Nippon neat Nippon CK that I

00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:16,620
pronounced it all participate in that

00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:18,330
expert group I don't recall if there

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,280
if there are showing anything this week

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,930
if they had a presentation this week but

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,870
if you go to the the Linux Foundation

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:27,090
events site you can find the all member

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,580
meeting link for last week at Monte

00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,440
Carlo and there was there were a number

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,060
of presentations about instrument

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,430
cluster expert group and there's also a

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,410
wiki page for that and they're planning

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:41,310
on doing some some work on a

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,990
containerized solution to allow ivi and

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:47,700
this from a cluster to run on the same

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:50,310
device as well as Suzuki has shown

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,920
already has shown an agpa GL instrument

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,590
cluster running on the Renaissance III

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,670
hardware and then scott mhairi here has

00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,370
been doing a lot of work on the

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,740
instrument cluster reference device that

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:06,150
we have runs on all the different boards

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:10,080
that we have a very sophisticated demo

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:12,290
is what he said yeah so we we have a

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,310
table at the tech showcase tomorrow

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,190
tomorrow evening you know there's the

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,690
tech showcase and and booth crawl so we

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,090
have a table at the tech showcase we

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,740
don't have a booth but we do have a

00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,880
table and we'll be showing that

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,340
hopefully will be showing that

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,990
instrument cluster demo tomorrow we

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,560
should be showing on the Raspberry Pi

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:34,830
the sand cloud the BeagleBone enhanced

00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:40,590
and we should be showing on the up

00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:41,940
square it tell up squared so some we

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,400
should be showing it on some mix of

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,240
those those boards both IDI and

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,240
instrument cluster

00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:58,290
adaptive AUTOSAR so this question was do

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:04,079
do we have a plants for completely

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:06,769
completing or competing cooperation with

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,759
it at AU AUTOSAR is a closed

00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:10,470
organization so we've had some

00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,809
discussions about working with them but

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:16,679
it's been hard too hard to find a way to

00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:17,910
do that they just have different they

00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:28,110
have different business interests than

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:28,439
our members yeah can you can you repeat

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,989
that

00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:33,749
what is the IGF in fact is it a

00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:35,489
distribution is it is it so there's a

00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:37,049
distribution absolutely there's a

00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:39,629
distribution all the source code you can

00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:42,149
go download there's a meta a GL

00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:45,509
layer that's a major component of that

00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:48,299
so basically and then on top of that you

00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:51,029
can build we build different reference

00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,119
devices so we have a meta meta

00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:56,100
instrument cluster I think it's called

00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:57,899
meta so you can basically then build all

00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,819
those reference devices we can build a

00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,249
GL core minimal and then and then the

00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:12,329
devices on top of that what is it

00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:14,790
benefits compared to Yoko so there's

00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,679
other infrastructure that a gel members

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,649
have contributed and then the project

00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,929
itself has funded so the application

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:24,199
framework that Walt mentioned that's a

00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:28,169
significant value add it's a a Geo

00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:30,360
specific enabler for OMS to build

00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:33,749
applications to run on top of the AGL

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,689
platform and that's an NGO open source

00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:38,999
project that's doesn't exist for you

00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:39,660
know it's a unique thing that AGL brings

00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:43,769
to the table

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:52,350
so just what is our is our target mirror

00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:54,180
here so you can see don't see it see if

00:16:52,350 --> 00:17:02,060
I do this

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:02,060
No okay

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,870
okay so that's our that's that's our

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:14,260
garden see our get mirrors you call up a

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:19,510
little let's grow up so we have these

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:26,199
meter - AGL layers yeah so that together

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:31,150
with your two layers with that we build

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:34,170
Adriel the collection that you need to

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:42,250
pull down you will find in atrial

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:48,100
repolarization specifics I in in meter

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:52,720
AGL and here you see all the reference

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:58,540
apps the services the applique reference

00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:04,059
applications and the in the if we scroll

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:09,850
down to source when there are the the

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:14,650
the unique middleware components atrial

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:21,429
hosts so the application framework sign

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:28,840
Agora that is yeah one one of the key

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:31,450
components in atrial a little while ago

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,490
we talked about instrument cluster and

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,100
when it comes to instrument cluster a

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:40,600
lot of buzzwords around security safety

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:43,600
compliance certifications come so how

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:47,440
does egl as an organization or project

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,480
deal with this so with respect to safety

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,340
in the instrument cluster so the

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,470
instrument cluster expert group is

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,299
addressing that and I don't have the I

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,380
could go grab them but so they're

00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,660
addressing that with a containerized

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,669
solution there's been also been a

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:04,600
proposal for a hypervisor solution to

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:06,309
keep the AGL code in a in a separate of

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,130
the virtual machine or a separate

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:11,200
container with the safety certifiable

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,760
part in another virtual machine or

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,850
container depending on which

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,940
architecture you look at the instrument

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,920
cluster expert group

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,860
particular if you go and look at last

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:28,160
week's all member meeting they made a

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:32,590
presentation was led by yamaguchi-san

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,000
from I shan't n Anna from I should aw

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,550
they made a presentation last week about

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,980
the architecture they are proposing that

00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,950
they want to show at CES and get into

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,470
the SourceTree with the I VI system and

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,780
the instrument cluster and the safety

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,600
the Telltale's and the buzzers all in

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,630
different Linux containers and so that's

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,330
the approach we're taking now being led

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:59,890
by Suzuki because they want to get this

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:02,960
into vehicles as quickly as possible and

00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:07,100
we are also participating in the ELISA

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,750
project where basically we are

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,610
encouraging our members to join ELISA

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,250
we're doing a little bit of support Yan

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,990
Simon and I I'll be attending the

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,480
functional what are they calling it the

00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,730
security the safety critical system

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,980
summit on Thursday so we'll be working

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,380
on how we've got a presentation about

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,490
that group in particular that is from a

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,950
cluster group and how they're going

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:31,130
about their work and how we can continue

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:34,310
to cooperate with ELISA so I expect that

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,310
in the next 12 to 18 months you'll see

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:41,090
both source code and some more definite

00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:42,230
plans from our OEMs and tier ones on how

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:47,350
they're going to achieve that safety

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,350
certification you're welcome

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:59,360
could you spend a few more words about

00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:04,610
the architecture of the SDK which comes

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,410
with a GL of the SDK for application

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,350
development this this is a question

00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:11,650
basically from a young person which is

00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:16,000
interested in knowing if it's possible

00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:18,830
to leverage any concept for different

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,570
context I mean is this really specific

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:28,490
for the middleware that you are

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:34,760
providing or no the XTS

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:38,480
is basically a wrapper and it has it has

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:44,110
a web UI and it can take basically any

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:46,429
Yocto sdk and it provides a couple of

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,080
wrappers that you can integrate into

00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:50,240
your IDE

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,620
I might actually I might throw the ball

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:58,250
over to Stefan there's our SDK people

00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,390
over there so he can use it a little

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,309
more this is why I said I don't really

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,559
know anything but I have people here to

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:08,390
do yeah thank you

00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:11,570
well there are two parts in fact the

00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:14,860
first one is that the SDK we produce

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,110
with the GL is as stated so you have to

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:21,559
puke two SDK so you get the costume

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:23,929
change and obviously I would say the

00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:26,179
development packages for the application

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:29,360
framework for the binder everything you

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:34,070
need to develop your code and run it

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,230
right but as many octo developers or not

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,500
your developers in fact people will want

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:41,480
to develop things on top of Yocto you

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,360
have two solutions in fact either you

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,940
write your own recipes so it's a hassle

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:50,059
it's it's a bit of paint the learning

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,789
curve is quite difficult it's doable of

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:56,750
course but you text months and years to

00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:59,030
get something correct I would say the

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:03,470
other path is to use the SDK which is

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:04,660
produced directly by the build and for

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:10,310
this you

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:13,640
environment which is stable which

00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:16,070
follows the releases of HCL and which is

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:19,340
quite easy for you as a developer I mean

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,080
you if you think about someone who's

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:24,620
developing web applications for example

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:27,200
or cute applications so it's not someone

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:31,940
which is specially used to sexuality

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,130
embedded stuff very low low details I

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,750
would say so we wanted to create

00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,290
something which makes life easier for

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:42,080
those people and typically if you are

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:45,800
able to take your ID you preferred ID

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,550
which will be eclipsed or visual court

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:53,240
or whatever ID you we want and you would

00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:55,820
be able to compile run and debug your

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,400
stuff while still leveraging the Yocto

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,600
sdk that could be great so that's what

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,720
we did with XE as just an abstraction of

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,180
the wall built system screwed you up to

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,370
SDK there is a docker container which

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,320
embeds the to chain you have to share

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,680
two sources with that container at all

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,830
so I wouldn't say it's very easy but at

00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:22,460
the end the result is as you will build

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:30,230
your application using your IDE as if

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:33,640
you were building natively it's very

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,640
close to in the concepts

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:46,690
no it's very generic it's it or enzyme

00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:50,080
outside it's closely related to

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:51,759
electricity in fact more than a GL but

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,059
one thing is specific in the automotive

00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:58,210
world is that you for cost reasons you

00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:59,979
want to have a big community of

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,009
developers and high-level apps

00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:04,599
developers which cost nothing so you

00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:07,570
have to deliver some tools for those

00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:09,849
people to to get hands on right that's

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,889
the reason for XDS but it could be moved

00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:15,239
to any any other market or project

00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:18,549
easily that's open to us after all you

00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:25,149
know no exactly you can you can have

00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:26,859
something lean yeah definitely while

00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:29,049
answering one of the previous questions

00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:31,119
you mentioned that inquiries from the

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,859
industrial automation industry what were

00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:37,139
they looking for in Ajo because

00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:39,460
automotive is kind of quite different

00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:41,080
yeah I think they were more interested

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,639
mostly interested in kind of how we're

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,590
packaging up things especially with the

00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:46,929
application framework so no specifics

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:51,489
like looking for how the middle of I was

00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:52,570
working or taking a slice well I mean if

00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:54,009
you think about the application

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,080
framework and how we're doing the

00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:57,669
security and have the middleware then

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,559
combines into that with the binder and

00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:02,889
the binding concept that's what I think

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,419
they're mostly interested in I really

00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:08,109
haven't had that many discussions with

00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:09,580
them because you know what I find that

00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,289
what I find typically is I come to

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,909
something like this or one of our all

00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:15,070
member meetings and I always learned

00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:17,919
about somebody using AGL for some new

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,450
way that I hadn't heard of those people

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,369
are grabbing the code and you know

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,779
because we're completely open

00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:23,919
people are always grabbing the code

00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:25,899
downloading it and doing something

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,869
interesting with it and they're not

00:26:25,899 --> 00:26:30,369
necessarily contributing anything back

00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:32,349
especially when we went to embed world

00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:35,649
in Nuremberg last year we saw all sorts

00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:37,840
of HCl AGL demos running in different in

00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:38,889
different booths with no credit back

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,229
some people even a little bit even

00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:45,220
removed the HCL logo from the from the

00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:49,109
UI uses and abuses what's that uses and

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,109
abuses of the code exactly exactly

00:26:51,460 --> 00:27:04,850
anybody else have a question no okay

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:08,419
one more since a few years there has

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:10,909
been a project called a purchase I think

00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:14,539
it's just mainly backed by Bosch right

00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:18,340
and they have some components for a

00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,340
middleware like video playback and

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,470
infotainment components is there any

00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:28,369
sort of contact or collaboration with

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:30,019
them we so Bosch I think they've

00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:31,519
contacted us about how we could possibly

00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,809
collaborate we've had some internal

00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:45,200
discussions with them but nothing

00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:49,359
concrete and do you have any test case

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:51,739
sit yes so actually John Simon runs our

00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,749
continuous integration and automated

00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:55,639
test group expert group and we have a

00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:59,960
large suite of tests that we run and

00:27:55,639 --> 00:28:03,619
I'll let him talk about that okay so we

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:09,440
have a set of automated tests that we

00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:12,619
run any code that is proposed in garrard

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:19,429
will be built and we test it on our

00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:22,099
reference platforms the of course we can

00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:26,989
throw in and to throw in even more no

00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:30,259
question we also have a set of manual

00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:32,919
test plants they are in our JIRA so

00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:37,970
there's a separate test plug-in in JIRA

00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:40,580
so their arms wrapper yeah so there's a

00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:44,330
test plug-in in our JIRA and we have

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,789
test cases there Eddy from console

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:52,029
coders those on a weekly basis for

00:28:46,789 --> 00:29:00,039
master and and the latest stable and

00:28:52,029 --> 00:29:00,039
Fujitsu is also doing test runs

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:08,760
and that is if you go to if you go to

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,529
groups that I owe our new mail list that

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,799
I have listed up there you can sign up

00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:15,630
for the test reports mail lists and you

00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,429
can get the the test reports that come

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:24,059
out of yes the automated tests they run

00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:26,340
after our Jenkins builds we will trigger

00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:28,919
a run on the lava infrastructure with

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,070
two different boards the results are

00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,020
then passed on to Colonel CI and Colonel

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:38,029
CI will do the email reports and that's

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:47,279
what you see in the in the test reports

00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:50,760
group it's not much of a technical

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:54,179
question but can I ask how do you get

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,309
the funds for four or how did you get

00:29:54,179 --> 00:30:00,750
yeah how do we pay for all this how you

00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:04,200
pay for this so yes so a GL has like I

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:06,059
said 155 member companies and the

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,740
everybody all these number companies

00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:10,559
have to be members of the Linux

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:14,010
Foundation and then beyond that they

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,549
join a GL as a project and the Platinum

00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:19,289
gold and silver members pay additional

00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:22,320
pay additional money to be part of a GL

00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:23,730
and have they get a seat on the advisory

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,559
board or could be elected to the

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,419
advisory board so they get a little more

00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,370
in addition to having some more for a

00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:32,419
bigger financial stake in a GL they also

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:34,710
get a little more say in the governance

00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:37,049
and that's not to say it's pay to play

00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,700
because many of our bronze members are

00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,220
some of our biggest contributors in

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,230
terms of code so once you're a member of

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,020
a GL once you remember the Linux

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:50,010
Foundation you can join as a bronze

00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,510
member basically for free above and

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,929
beyond the Linux Foundation membership

00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:56,549
and then if you if you want more say in

00:30:54,929 --> 00:31:01,169
the governance then you can join that

00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:03,840
silver gold or platinum it's this

00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:06,690
membership fees or triple the next

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,820
foundation no it's mid needs as far as

00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:10,720
the funding is that that money that we

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,580
collect from silver gold and

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:19,440
the members then goes to fund AGL

00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:19,440
activities like the infrastructure me

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,230
John Simon thank you

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:47,040
hi what is the main difference between

00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:49,420
Asia and under with automotive I

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,940
honestly don't know a lot about Android

00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,200
automotive other than what I because

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,220
there's a lot of there a lot other stuff

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,230
is under NDA basically we're work work

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,080
Android automotive is being controlled

00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:04,300
by Google you've got a sign you know a

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,150
lot of legal documents with Google you

00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,740
have no say in the governance and and

00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:13,840
what Google decides their roadmap is

00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:15,760
going to be AGL is completely open you

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,470
can download our code at any time you

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,150
can go do whatever you want with it

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:23,830
based on the open source licenses that

00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:25,480
we have if you want to join as a member

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,160
you can have some say in the governance

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,110
of it and the roadmap things like that

00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,910
so the biggest difference is really work

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,280
or are completely open projects and

00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,710
anybody can contribute and and have a

00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,760
say in where we're going which is not

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,760
the case with Google

00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:11,320
any of anybody else he likes to be

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:14,500
called a microphone engineer that's a

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,549
question about whether that AGL has some

00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:22,480
to wean additional I mean like a lot

00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:24,270
kind of Alcazar has its visual tooling

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,450
from different manufacturers different

00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:30,909
software companies do you have something

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:34,510
like that that will ease my like as a

00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:36,130
developer life to sell up like I have

00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:38,470
like different I'll see use and I want

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:42,190
to easily communicate with my software

00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:44,409
written with AGL underneath so we okay

00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,059
so a couple couple ways to approach that

00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:49,270
there we have a documentation site and a

00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:51,669
wiki page in terms of tooling we've got

00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:53,500
the SDK that Stefan was describing that

00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:56,470
I think we're working on improving all

00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,059
the time and then the great thing about

00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,770
this ecosystem is there's a number of

00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:02,770
companies who have been contributing

00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:06,400
quite a bit to AGL you know smaller tier

00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:08,830
two's who are always willing to jump in

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,960
and help people who want to get up and

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:15,040
running quickly of course they want to

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,720
get paid for that but so depending on

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,010
this scale in which you want to get you

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,050
know you're trying to you're trying to

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,260
ramp things up you have the option of

00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:24,639
you know just joining the community

00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,290
working out in the open or working even

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,030
behind closed doors and just asking us

00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:30,700
questions we I've seen companies do that

00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:33,520
too and then or you can engage a

00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:36,820
services company to to help you out and

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,609
and those from what I've seen there's a

00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,659
number of we have a I should have Emily

00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:43,619
should have said something while she was

00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:46,960
sitting there we have a on our website

00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:49,000
we have a vendor direct vendor

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,460
marketplace or a vendor directory you

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,950
can go to and I can't see my screen very

00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,570
well but it I can add that I can add

00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:58,420
that link to the slides if you go to

00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:00,130
automotive Linux org you'll see there's

00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,330
a vendor marketplace and you can click

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,950
on that and you can see all the

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:06,339
different vendors who offer services

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,210
around a GL if you if you want to get it

00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,500
you know if you need help getting

00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,070
kick-started you can go that direction

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,070
as well

00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,400
okay thank you there's also there's also

00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,560
a link there where if you're a vendor

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,090
who's a member of AGL you can click the

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,130
link there to be added to the vendor

00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,900
directory if you have a product or a

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:36,680
service around AGL that you want to

00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:38,720
you're providing that's all part of that

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,680
we're building an ecosystem of of

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,920
companies so timewise I think our time

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,810
is up thanks all for coming and

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,310
participating because otherwise if you

00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:53,060
didn't participate it would be pretty

00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:55,070
boring and hopefully I'll see you around

00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,340
this week I'll be here all week thank

00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:01,409
you

00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:01,409
