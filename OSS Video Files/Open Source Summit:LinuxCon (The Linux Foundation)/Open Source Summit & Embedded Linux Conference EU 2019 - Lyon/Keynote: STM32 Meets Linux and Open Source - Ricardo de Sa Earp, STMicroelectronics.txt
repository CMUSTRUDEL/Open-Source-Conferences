good morning everyone it's with a great

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,319
pleasure that I'm here today to share

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,269
with you what STMicroelectronics is

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:15,990
doing in the open-source environment and

00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:19,260
embedded embedded Linux left last

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:23,519
February we have launched in the market

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,070
with a great success our first stm32 mp1

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,529
so it's the first microprocessor that st

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,949
is releasing to the market it's more

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,980
than simple another microprocessor it's

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,670
a full solution including of course the

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:45,210
hardware component we have a duo cortex

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:48,770
a7 with a cortex m4 plus 3d advanced 3d

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:53,129
graphics acceleration a rich

00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:55,940
connectivity analog integration and of

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:00,329
course security advanced security

00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:06,000
solutions all these with of course up

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:09,330
streamed Linux drivers our stm32 cube

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,920
software suite has been enhanced with a

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,770
new offer that meets new microprocessor

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,320
requirements and we have worked with a

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:24,450
lot of partners so we have implemented a

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:27,659
full community with partners that are

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:32,040
skilled in their domain and supporting

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:35,460
our solution so this is let's say a step

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,320
for us in the direction of meeting the

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,430
needs of our customers to build new

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,799
systems and make easy for them to build

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,290
solutions and applications and we are

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,130
bringing to this market our brands

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,979
so the stm32 brand is recognized in the

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:57,930
microcontroller space today we have with

00:01:52,979 --> 00:02:02,009
it our long term commitment of supply we

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,890
have a very strong community supporting

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,729
our products very high quality standards

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,160
and a good a very solid technical

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,920
support and now we are bringing this to

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,950
the microprocessor microprocessor

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,010
filled building let's say a

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,310
microprocessor application solution was

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,010
an important step for us to enable a

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,430
very easy customer application software

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,040
development in this way customers can

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,800
add and develop software that is adding

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,170
value to the end-user and I think

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,790
software today can add a lot of value to

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,730
the application and it's actually the

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,640
main driver of bringing value to the

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,550
different to the different systems we

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:53,760
have developed an open open software

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,560
environment this is let's say extremely

00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,049
important for us because it allows

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,580
customers to add value and add value

00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:05,220
developed added value I piece very

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,400
easily and they can fully benefit from

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,880
the open source and easily port their

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,430
software to to the new new systems they

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,819
want to do so here we are bringing our

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,519
strong image on the microcontrollers we

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,040
have shipped more than 2 billion we ship

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,680
more than 2 billion microcontrollers per

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,769
year and this now is coming to the micro

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,090
processors we have since the beginning

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:36,120
worked with open source communities

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,930
various open source communities and for

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,900
us it was a very let's say easy decision

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,410
an immediate decision to upstream the

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,900
code so the code is on the community

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,269
today we believe this is the way to make

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,450
the applications evolve and to make sure

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,790
that every individual developer can make

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:01,049
full take full benefit of the open

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,950
source community the open St Linux

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:07,340
distribution is the name that is given

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:12,139
to the to the distribution that supports

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:15,690
the stm32 mp1 it's a full mainlined

00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:18,060
distribution it's not just let's see a

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:22,380
dedicated and customized solution by

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:26,210
Asti it's fully up streamed and in our

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,960
solution we are integrating the pre

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,030
Leticia pre

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,130
rated secure OS d opti this is a let's

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,360
see a sakura ass that is managing the

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,250
communication between an unsecured

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,979
unsecured Linux kernel and a trusted

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,940
application and these allows let's say

00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:51,599
to really master the security systems st

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,630
has been actively involved in the

00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:56,550
security aspects of the different

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,919
initiatives with the full support of a

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,039
farm and this I think is one of the key

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,889
trends in the systems today as devices

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,949
become more and more connected security

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:12,090
becomes an important part of of the

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:16,789
system we have and you see this in our

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:19,139
boot we have supported the products with

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,050
demonstration boards so we have a full

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,630
set of boards evaluation board discovery

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,210
boards boards made with partners that

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,789
enables our customers to really speed up

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,860
the demonstration and the prototyping

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:36,659
and the validation of their solutions

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,970
and finally please come to see us at our

00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:41,880
booth I think you have the occasion to

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,909
meet our engineers discuss about our

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,479
products our solutions our software

00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:50,880
systems and we I'm sure it'll be the

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,550
beginning of a long journey between

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,700
between our companies so thank you very

00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:00,959
much for your your attention

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,959
