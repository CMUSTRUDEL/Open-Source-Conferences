	Location Services and Direction Finding with Bluetooth - Martin Woolley, Bluetooth SIG*

Bluetooth acquired a new capability in 2019. It’s now possible with suitable hardware, to calculate the direction a Bluetooth signal is being transmitted from, using one of two methods known as Angle of Arrival (AoA) or Angle of Departure (AoD). From this, it’s possible to accurately determine the location of the receiving device to within a matter of centimetres rather than metres. Proximity applications like Point of Interest (PoI) information systems and the classic “key finder” are all set to get very accurate and much easier to use. Positioning systems such as Real Time Locating Systems (RTLS) and Way Finding will offer a level of precision, never before possible with Bluetooth.

Learn about this new Bluetooth feature and how it works under the hood, from the physics of radio waves upwards through the layers of the Bluetooth protocol stack.
