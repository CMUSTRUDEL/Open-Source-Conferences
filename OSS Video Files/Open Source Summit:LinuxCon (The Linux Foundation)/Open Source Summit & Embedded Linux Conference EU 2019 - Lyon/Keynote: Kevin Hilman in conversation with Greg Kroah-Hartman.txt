hi welcome um first good question

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,099
everybody asks what is kernel CI and why

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,759
does it matter well Jim I guess started

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,530
it but the the the main thing is kernel

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,220
CI is a project for testing the kernel

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,289
and it's a project that started when I

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,810
guess six or seven years ago now mostly

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,760
among a few kernel maintainer x' that

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,410
we're recognizing that well like Jim

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,849
said we're Linux runs everywhere that

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,490
runs on so many different pieces of

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,260
hardware but the testing on that

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,090
hardware is very minimal a lot of people

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,530
most people were just testing on the few

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,660
things that they cared about so as

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,860
maintainer x' we wanted to test it on as

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,270
much hardware as we could to make sure

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,230
that we're actually supporting all the

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,850
hardware that we claimed we're

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,860
supporting so that's kind of how it

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,530
began in the in the kernel community so

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,390
it's just collecting a bunch of hardware

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,739
and running the kernel on as much of

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,300
this hardware as possible is kind of

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,860
where the project began so that yeah we

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,050
had the maintainer summit for the kernel

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,539
a couple weeks ago and one of the big

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,399
problems that we have now is we have six

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,140
or seven different projects that are

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,119
sending kernel developers and maintainer

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,590
x' bug reports saying they're doing

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,180
kernel they're doing testing whatnot and

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,350
so much so that they find the same

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,479
problems and we're getting really

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,509
annoyed so we came together and said

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,890
pick one and do that and so we've agreed

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,450
on this one right everybody all the

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,159
companies finally agreed we're all gonna

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,020
work together not to duplicate it to

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,659
work yeah so we went from a problem of

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,250
having not not very much testing to in

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,900
the last two years maybe we've seen a

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,790
lot more CI efforts and a lot more

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,290
testing efforts on the kernel but

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,610
they've been kind of fragmented and so

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,350
yeah we've been a lot of different

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,729
projects or sending doing different

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,470
types of testing on different types of

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,390
hardware and so yeah the idea behind

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,280
kernel CI is let's let's let's

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,079
collaborate on that stuff let's work

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,670
together I mean we have open source

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,110
software for the kernel but we're we

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,729
don't really we haven't taken the open

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,159
source approach to our testing efforts

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,229
so kernel CI wants to kind of collect

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,610
that and let's start sharing our testing

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,290
software just like we're sharing the

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,729
rest of our code yeah because all those

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,619
other testing efforts were actually

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,090
closed source so people weren't opening

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,770
their tests or the system for stranger

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,079
so people couldn't duplicate it so we

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,180
get a bug and we couldn't maintainer can

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,560
duplicate it whatnot and now we're

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,539
finally solving that problem hopefully

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,009
we're creating a place that we can

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,490
hopefully solve that problem when we go

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,110
and share

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,270
to share more testing and share more

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,620
infrastructure work in you and as part

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,000
of the plumbers conference you guys all

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,860
all those different projects got

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,170
together in head of the day yeah yeah

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,640
and what did you guys decide well we did

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,620
well first of all we just decided that

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,900
this is a this is the right thing to do

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,850
okay but I think that the impetus behind

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,080
that at plumbers especially was there

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,840
was several other discussions that

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,730
plumbers that were basically around

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,860
we're finding bugs way quicker than we

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,180
can actually fix them so because of

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,880
these testing efforts and particularly

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,210
some of the kernel fuzzing efforts the

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,220
ability for us to find bugs and and well

00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,170
yeah finding track bugs is actually

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,630
increased outpaced our ability to

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,330
actually fix them and and track them and

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,980
so we need to in you know not only do

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,930
better testing but do better tracking

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,850
and fixing and making sure that we can

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,040
actually do these things in the kernel

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,480
yeah like syz bodies family I started

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,920
tracking things and they're working with

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,050
you guys on that right yeah that's good

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,060
yeah so of all these individual things

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,760
so why is it important that we now have

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,500
a formal governance and founding of a

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,360
project for well I think that the

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,490
governance helps because it gives a

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,570
place where we can actually share the

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,070
companies are generally a little

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,620
reluctant to share I'm not sure why

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,510
testings testing software is considered

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,730
secret sauce but a lot of companies

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,800
consider it secret so or at least

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,780
special or something so having this

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,520
Linux Foundation project is a is kind of

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,870
a neutral place where we can share start

00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,970
collaborating on some of that stuff and

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,680
and hopefully realize pretty quickly

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,000
that and most people are doing the same

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,800
thing there's a lot of stuff we can

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,290
collaborate on lot of a lot of data that

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,210
we can share so I think just having that

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,250
that neutral place that the Linux

00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,890
Foundation is is going to provide them

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,810
so we won't create yet another testing

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,160
yeah I hope your framework I hope we

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,520
don't create yet another testing

00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:00,270
framework we probably will but I hope at

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,310
least we can do more yelling now so

00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,630
along those lines what can we expect I

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,040
mean I what is your roadmap for the

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,870
future I know you've had wish lists in

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,100
the past now that we have a formal

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,350
organization and everybody's working

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,690
together what can we expect to see yeah

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,710
so we have actually each of these each

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,330
of the projects that have been

00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,620
collaborating have a wish list so we're

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,510
getting together and kind of putting our

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,070
wish list together I think well the

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,660
first thing on the wish list is to just

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,000
start sharing our code and and and

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,100
sharing our our test results in

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,620
collaborating on kind of the

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,480
basic infrastructure pieces but then the

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,250
probably the the next biggest item on

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,440
the wish list is better reporting and

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,180
better like better visualizing the

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,890
several these projects have been running

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,300
tests for years and collecting a lot of

00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,770
data we're not doing anything with that

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,440
data at the moment so we've got actually

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,910
quite a bit of data on the historical

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,110
testing of the kernel that we could be

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,640
mining and actually doing some

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,830
interesting things with so I think

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,510
there's collaborating on that you know

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,370
only sending one or two one or two males

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,260
to you instead of ten right when they're

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,450
good stable or just send me something

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,860
that I can understand yeah yeah that's

00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,570
hard you get these reports and it's

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,850
buried way in the middle we want to send

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,400
you a happy face or a sad face and

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:08,270
that's it yeah I some people start using

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,620
me emojis for any check boxes yeah that

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,960
would be good I'm okay with that

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,170
I'm okay with that much couldn't handle

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,150
emojis yeah cool so what else anything

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,790
else that's yeah just better

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,710
collaboration and better I mean you know

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,880
all the the big data stuff there's

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,170
actually quite a bit of data we could

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,390
start mining so I'm looking forward to

00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,740
bringing some skills outside the kernel

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,810
community to help us start looking at

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,010
all this data and doing some doing some

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,200
analysis there's probably some pretty

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,820
interesting trends and and stuff we

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,080
could mine from this historical data as

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,750
well so that's another thing on my

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,670
listen okay so it's part of the

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,920
long-term kernel and the stable kernels

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,810
I do kernel CI runs all this stuff all

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,580
the time and it's really important to me

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,480
to make sure that things don't regress

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,040
and people can rely on this stuff why is

00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,080
this important or I know you want to

00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,120
talk about that what about that yeah so

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,860
that's important for a few reasons one

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,350
for you just to be able to help you and

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,910
Sasha decide when when stuff is stable

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,460
and when it's not stable and to give you

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,530
kind of a path to what's kind of a

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,720
baseline for what's what's a stable

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,520
kernel but it's also really helpful for

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,350
companies that are shipping products on

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,550
unstable kernels I mean my company

00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,170
Bailey Bri we work with a lot of

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,730
companies shipping Linux products and

00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,260
they're when they're looking at like a

00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,330
next-generation product they want to

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,950
move to the latest kernel and having

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,180
some sort of kernel testing

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,320
infrastructures that they can look at

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,450
and say okay we're gonna move to the

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,830
next kernel and all these tests have

00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,900
already run on that kernel I think it's

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,760
like having this database of what

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,229
kernels what stable kernels are already

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,760
out there what they've already run what

00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:36,020
their past what the tests they've been

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,540
running and so on I think is a really

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,070
good resource for people to rely

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,390
to be able to decide what Colonel

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,300
they're gonna ship in the next product

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,530
and people can take Colonel CI and run

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,460
it on their internal boards because I

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,500
know a lot of companies don't like

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,910
publishing things before hardware comes

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
out or products come out and that's a

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,450
big thing about Colonel so yeah that's

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,400
much different from other stuff yeah so

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,320
colonel CI we have a service at colonel

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,420
CI org that we run for all the community

00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,950
stuff but this all the software behind

00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,750
that service is open source so you can

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,300
take it in you're inside a company and

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,040
run it as well on your own hardware if

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,750
you don't want to share tests and for

00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,070
you if you don't want to share the new

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,900
hardware that's not quite out yet that

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,580
type of thing and then you can flip a

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,690
switch and start publishing results to

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,610
the community when the hardware is

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,380
available or when when the things aren't

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,760
secret anymore and you can test your

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,780
three million lines of code you've added

00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,740
to the colonel next right nothing

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,150
regrettable actually that's really

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,550
important it's a lot of embedded devices

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,840
are that way most yeah a lot of products

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,700
still have a lot of stuff now not up

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,730
still out a tree that's a different

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,080
that's a different different chat

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,360
anything else you want to talk about no

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,530
I think that covers yeah okay how come

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,170
people get involved colonel CI org it's

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,360
up there we have a mailing list we have

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,690
