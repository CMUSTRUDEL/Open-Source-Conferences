	Keynote: Calling All Doc Stars - Megan Byrd-Sanicki, Open Source Strategist, Google

The world has enough rock stars; let’s get some more docs stars. Join Megan Byrd-Sanicki to learn why docs is the superpower your project needs to grow adoption—and how Google supports open source with insights and programs that will help your project.

it is an honor to be here and I bet

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,050
you're wondering why is Google calling

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,450
all Doc stars well the answer is simple

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,000
we have so many rock stars in our open

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,430
source industry excuse me have a little

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,670
cold but we do have so many rock stars

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,160
and we've made amazing software together

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,119
and it's being used all over the world

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,890
as Erica and Cheryl had mentioned and

00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,040
let's face it we like when people use

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,340
our software it allows us to help people

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,370
at scale and let's face it it feels

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,500
pretty good when people use our stuff so

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,940
the question is how do we get more

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,390
people to use our software and the

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,940
answer is documentation and that's why

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,030
we need more doc stars so you can see

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,370
from this survey from digitalocean that

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,559
documentation is the number one adoption

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,039
driver for our projects and that makes

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,110
sense it is obviously an easy way to

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,659
help everyone learn how to use the

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,460
software and it also makes our projects

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:14,189
much more accessible but unfortunately

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,460
we don't have enough doc stars in this

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,229
survey only 4% of the participants said

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,860
they're contributing to documentation

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:25,049
and that's a problem that's a problem

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,210
for Google and that's a problem for our

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,030
whole industry it's a real missed

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,250
opportunity and Google wanted to start

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,880
to address this so we conducted some

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,170
research to understand what are the top

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,509
blockers to contributing to

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:45,770
documentation and we found that there

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:48,840
were three time support and reward and

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,299
well let's face it a contributor only

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,030
has so much time and they're going to

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,119
choose a path that's easy and rewarded

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,899
and that's usually the case with

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,840
contributing to code it's a very

00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:06,570
well-documented process very supported

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,479
and of course it is very well rewarded

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,510
with lots of recognition programs that

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,920
different projects provide to highlight

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,590
and amplify those code

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,110
contributors but unfortunately this just

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,770
is not the case with people who

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,840
contribute to documentation and so if

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,420
you are looking to address this in your

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,330
project we have three Pro tips for you

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:35,220
the first one is target your first-time

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,989
contributors if you remember your first

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,870
time contributing it was a little bit

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,640
scary well you can make it less scary by

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,769
giving them a path to contribute to

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,670
documentation it's just a little bit

00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,440
easier but if you do offer that you want

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,350
to make sure that you provide a very

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,590
smooth and easy process and what that

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,280
means is that you need to document how

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,660
to contribute to documentation and

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,540
that's a little meta but it's really

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,019
important you also need to take out the

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,910
mystery of how to write good Doc's and

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,560
so you want to provide templates and

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,690
that's another thing Google is working

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,239
on with a new project called the good

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,650
Doc's project so keep your eye out for

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,790
that in the future and then lastly when

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,190
you are doing your reward and

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,640
recognition programs please include your

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,350
doc stars make them feel like they're

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,480
just like heroes like all your other

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:34,380
kinds of contributors and include them

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,810
in your release notes so we hope that

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,150
you'll use these Pro tips we're using

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,489
them at Google but we also feel there's

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,709
a sense of urgency and we want to make

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,739
sure that we have more than 4% of

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:50,519
contributors writing documentation we

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,350
want 10 and 20% and so we are putting

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,660
our money where our mouth is and we have

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,480
launched a new program called season of

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,109
Docs it's similar to our google Summer

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:05,130
of Code which matches students with

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:08,040
projects to work on code but for season

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,109
of Docs we are hiring tech writers and

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,410
paying them to work on project

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:16,560
documentation I am really pleased that

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,109
this year we are working with these 50

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,690
projects and we have already secured the

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:24,330
tech writers and the work is underway

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,610
it's going to be concluding between

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,430
December January really

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,419
excited to see what kind of impact we

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,689
can make together

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,099
and I'm also equally excited to see what

00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:39,250
kind of learnings we're gonna get from

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:40,930
this program so that we can evolve this

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,699
program more and also share the

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,599
learnings out with all of you so we can

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:48,099
all improve together so if you are if

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:50,229
you would like more information about

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,810
season of Docs or Google Summer of Code

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,639
or any of our open source programs or

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:58,210
projects please check us out on our

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,029
website or follow us on Twitter and in

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,030
the meantime please remember to think a

00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:08,550
dockstar because we need them thank you

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,550
