	Keynote: HERE and the Open Location Journey - Oliver Fink, Director, Interactive Data, HERE Technologies

Location is at the core of HERE Technologies and "Giving Back" is one of our key values. The Open Location Journey starts with people and is driven by data. This is becoming increasingly important in a world that has become ever more complex and interdependent. Open source, open data and open access foster individual and local participation which both informs and inspires social change - this needs to be open for everyone.
