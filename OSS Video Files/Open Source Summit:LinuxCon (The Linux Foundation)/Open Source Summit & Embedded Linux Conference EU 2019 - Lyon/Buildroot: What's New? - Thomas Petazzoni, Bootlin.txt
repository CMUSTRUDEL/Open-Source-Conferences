	Buildroot: What's New? - Thomas Petazzoni, Bootlin

Buildroot is a popular tool to build customized and lightweight embedded Linux systems. By automating the complete process of cross-compilation, it provides an easy and efficient way to build from the source code your toolchain, Linux kernel, bootloader and root filesystem images, using the 2500+ existing packages. Based on the well-known make and kconfig tools, it is simple to use while being powerful. It is for example used by companies such as Tesla or GoPro for some of their products.

Developed by an active community of 100+ contributors, and delivering relases every 3 months, Buildroot is in constant evolution. In this talk, we'll cover the most important improvements, additions and changes of the past two years as well as the current topics and features on the radar.
