	The 'S' in IoT stands for Security - Andrew Martin, Control Plane & Viktor Petersson, WoTT

IoT security isn't rocket surgery, but a race to market has left a proliferation of insecure, unpatchable devices strewn across the internet. Well-established software delivery and security best practices are routinely ignored, and a series of laughable breaches has left users and governments scrabbling for better solutions.

Recent advances in IoT-friendly hardware have expanded the options available to manufacturers, and paved the road to lightweight containerisation of connected devices. This talk will discuss the current state of the art in consumer and industrial IoT device security, examine some recent vulnerabilities, breaches, and attacks, and explore how to use containers to secure devices from current and future threats.
