it's a great pleasure to be here and

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:07,200
honor I know many of you many of you are

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:12,030
part of our community we're now 3,200

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,639
strong and growing and we Gemini's sat

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,460
together just about a year to the day in

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,080
San Francisco and had had dinner and

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,939
talked about kind of what happens after

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,039
what comes next Microsoft had just

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,130
become a participant in the community

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,130
and had exposed its patents as part of

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,710
its transition to open culturally as

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,140
well as through implementation and

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,540
participation in forums like this and

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,329
and in obviously and as a member of the

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,790
board of the Linux Foundation and so we

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,020
saw that as a watershed event very

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,960
significant symbolically as well as is

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,700
directly and in actuality and so talked

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,230
about kind of where the other threats

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,449
what are the risks what are the things

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,309
that can destabilize her or put the

00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:02,670
confidence that that has grown over the

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,060
last 15 to 20 years at such an acute

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,409
level where people are collaborating

00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,780
incorporating code of all types from the

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,369
open source projects and then feeling

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,040
confident about their ability to do so

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,350
without fear of of litigation and so

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,360
that that nice new norm that's been

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,090
established over the last dozen years or

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,189
so we wanted to make sure that we could

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,810
reinforce that and so we talked about

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,330
how we could collaborate and one of the

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,310
things that that kind of you know again

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,280
Jim's I think comments about genome are

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,900
quite accurate there there are there are

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,880
hundreds of companies that are out there

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,610
their purpose and goal is to aggregate

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,950
patents for with a desire to be able to

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,079
see really litigate just to give you a

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,100
sense that Rothschild is the litigant

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,110
the plaintiff in the suit against genome

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,320
is has filed seven hundred and fourteen

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,450
suits over the last six years this is a

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,149
bad company this is an entity that's

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,210
antithetical to the to the goals of

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,340
innovation and it doesn't care what's in

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,409
its path they will sue foundations it

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,119
will sue obviously not for profits it

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,849
will sue individuals it will sue

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,989
corporations and they the playbook is to

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,440
be able to establish a pattern of wins

00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:16,950
through

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,570
relatively modest settlements but you

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,880
know I think you should feel comfortable

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,860
the community the maturity the community

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,450
is really reflected in Bill McGovern and

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,640
what and how he's managing and

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:30,270
coordinating with really top-flight

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,220
counsel ten or fifteen years ago this

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,650
would have been much more of a fudge

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,810
situation now it's just kind of business

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,730
as usual the community's maturity

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,740
resilience is something that's quite

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,200
remarkable and I've seen it over the

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,880
last 11 and a half years of my tenure in

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,250
in managing and coordinating the

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,680
activities of oin and I think that's a

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,540
testament to the fact that there is this

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,080
great legal network of individuals

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,970
across the world that understand the

00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,670
copyright side and understand the patent

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,110
side and are driving increasingly toward

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,620
this new set of norms that Jim

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,200
referenced and so what we are looking to

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,060
do is and we'll this is just a kind of a

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,220
advance notice on something that we've

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,630
been working on really since that time

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,700
in in October of 18 what we're looking

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,050
to do is come together to collaborate

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,580
along with two very significant

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,090
companies operating companies that are

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,070
active in many many projects and to work

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,920
with those companies and to work with

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,850
the community to invalidate poor quality

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,310
patents that's really the lifeblood of

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,590
of these non-practicing entities and so

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,959
what we will what we will be announcing

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,670
in the next several weeks is a program

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,739
where the LF and oin are getting

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,410
together to fund in conjunction with

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,110
with support from two very significant

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,680
operating companies a program designed

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,360
to attack poor quality patents and to

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,459
invalidate them so that they can't be

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,239
used in the way that Rothschild is using

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:06,660
the patents that they own to be able to

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,519
try and extract rents on on patents that

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,080
are that actually have very significant

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,489
amount of prior art and so the

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,570
activities of the genome foundation are

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,160
laudable kudos to Neal and the great

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,020
counsel that he's brought in from

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,450
Sherman and Sterling which is really a

00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,220
Kenyan and Kenyan group that was hired

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,350
in a couple of years ago and we

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,880
providing prior art doing what we do all

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,490
the time we just provided the most

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,220
recent spate of prior art last week to

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,080
to council to the Sherman Stirling

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,970
people things are working as they should

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,910
in that case and I think you'll see a

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,350
good result as they stay the course and

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:50,710
proceed with with the legal the legal

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:52,480
process and I want you to basically say

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,940
that what you're seeing and what I'm

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,190
talking about now is the pivot of öin we

00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,680
focus almost exclusively in the

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,380
beginning on not on practicing entity

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,880
operating company risks patents that are

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,830
essentially were held by operating

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,900
companies whose behaviors were

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,030
antagonistic to Linux there were fewer

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,130
than fewer of those companies as we as

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,320
we move forward in the community and

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:18,160
open source becomes more relevant to all

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,020
companies and so now we are pivoting to

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,190
be able to focus on non-practicing

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,630
entity risk as well as some residual

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:27,760
operating company risk and so that's

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,460
part of the nuance strategy to be able

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,169
to be more Bennett more provide more

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,210
benefits of the community and reduce

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:36,820
risk and so I just wanted to let you

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,830
know that that this is something that we

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,750
take very seriously and the reduction of

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,370
risk is something that we live live and

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,110
breathe on a day-in and day-out basis

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,270
thank you very much for the opportunity

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,630
to be with you today and I hope that you

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:53,660
have a great great set of days

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,660
