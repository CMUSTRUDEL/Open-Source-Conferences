hey friends it's great to be here looks

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,250
like I have my work cut out for me not a

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,859
lot of folks know about the open J's

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,019
foundation so I am just delighted to

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,030
share a little bit more about our new

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,780
organization and really what led me to

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,660
leave my career at Microsoft enjoying

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,270
the Linux Foundation so you know if

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:29,310
you're online today you're probably

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:32,160
using JavaScript if you know that more

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,460
than 95% of the world's websites use

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,879
JavaScript including many of the major

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,140
web apps that we all know and love and

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,809
there's also one of my new favorite

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,320
customers who's a big user of JavaScript

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,649
and node J s and that's NASA you know

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,829
that nasa uses these technologies to

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,660
build solutions for spacesuits and these

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,000
IT solutions not only help keep

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,250
astronauts safe it helps them reach

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,590
their dream it's much like Jessica and

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,379
Christina did last month so I thought

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,510
that was pretty cool so if you see now

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,700
that like JavaScript really is central

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,580
to the web in the cloud just as

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,890
developers are to our world but how do

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,100
you take this technology and keep it

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,770
trustworthy and keep it modern with an

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,210
astronomical user base I mean it really

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,900
is like kind of a humbling and an

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,850
awesome responsibility well the answer

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,070
is you I'm all of you in the open-source

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,820
community plus our new home at the open

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,229
J's Foundation and while we're new many

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,750
of us have actually been around for a

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,759
long time and from the J's foundation

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,700
the node foundation and many more and

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,590
we've able been able to take really the

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,649
best of both worlds and adopt what

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,299
really works and in fact I do go way

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,000
back with the node foundation in my

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,159
early days at Microsoft we worked to

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,950
co-found the organization with several

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,840
leaders across the industry because we

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,600
knew then that by creating an

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,280
independent kind of a neutral foundation

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,680
we really could help increase the number

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,600
of contributions to the node project and

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,119
really ensure the project's future

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,530
success so for me joining this

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,270
organization has been really amazing

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,010
because there's just just the strength

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,569
and the resilience of all of the people

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,640
coming together and joining this new

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,049
organization in such a positive and

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,400
productive way has been really great to

00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:26,189
see so today the open jazz foundation

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,730
hosts over 30 important projects

00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:35,010
including appium dojo jQuery nodejs and

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,360
web pack we have really our members

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,190
really make it happen

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,920
they not only provide the financial

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,299
support for our projects but they really

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,470
are active in our governments our

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:49,079
governance process and now that we're an

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,090
umbrella organization we really wanted

00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,670
to create a goal and that was to really

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,639
create a model that gives a strong voice

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,099
to our projects so we've designed it

00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,370
this way we have a cross project Council

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:05,040
we call it the CPC and they serve like a

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,549
centralized role to provide technical

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:13,260
governance and provide moderation

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:16,500
onboarding new projects and and they're

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,239
great folks we also have our open of Jas

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,739
Foundation board of directors and Todd

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,190
Moore from IBM as our board president

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,930
sitting right there hey Todd they

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,090
provide our vision and direction and are

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,269
very active in supporting me and the

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,579
organization and so what we really want

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,340
is for our projects to really operate

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,109
independently but use the foundation to

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,329
remove that friction so the open source

00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:44,010
projects can really grow and get better

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:47,310
every day we've also created policies

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,199
that give projects the confidence that

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,549
they're entering an ecosystem that is

00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,349
stable and open we have discussions as

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,989
much as we can always in the open and we

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,510
really encourage decision makings at all

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,680
levels and we know the JavaScript

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,109
community is large so we're always

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,629
working and reaching out beyond our

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,190
members to bring in new projects and

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,389
you'll find many of our leaders actually

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:15,359
working in the standard setting bodies

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:18,510
for example ECMO and the w3c we've had a

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,250
really busy cool month at the Open Jazz

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,729
foundation so I thought I'd share a few

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,889
things that's happened since I joined we

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,870
just welcome to incubation projects to

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,150
the organization

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,980
no diversion manager you may know as nvm

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,700
it's a widely used method for installing

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,550
nodejs and managing multiple versions

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,350
they just joined this incubation project

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,370
and we just welcome the amp project the

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,480
open J's foundation how many know amp

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,390
there you go

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,670
so M is a web component framework it

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:53,670
allows publishers to create websites

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,070
where pages load very quickly it's

00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,740
actually usin 30 million domains and

00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,850
billions of web pages really important

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,950
open source projects and it's

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,390
implemented in products like Google

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,710
Microsoft Bing

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,710
Pinterest and pantheon

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:17,670
so we also shipped another program just

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,310
last week that was in high demand from

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,720
our community over the past couple years

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,790
our node professional certification

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,190
program and we developed this program

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,540
with node source and near form because

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,240
we thought it would be a really great

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,970
way for you as developers to showcase

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,970
your talents in the job market and for

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,720
companies to find top talent now the

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,010
program the exam is actually

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,220
administered through a remote Proctor

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,230
through screen sharing and streaming and

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,050
so it really allows you to become a node

00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,700
certified developer from your home and

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,350
given sort of the virtual nature of the

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,150
test we really wanted to make this

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,440
accessible to anyone in the world but we

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,970
actually have found that we're gonna

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
have to work on some of our pricing

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,480
models to make it more accessible to

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,830
everyone in the world so we really need

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,620
your help to do that and we'll be having

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:09,600
more to share in the coming weeks there

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,190
we go so I've been on a little bit of a

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,490
listening tour I've been on the job for

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,560
a month and one theme I keep hearing is

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,560
you know I'm like what should we do

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,480
they're like do more and so we've had a

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,740
few priorities that are sort of rising

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,900
to the top that I'm hearing one we need

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,580
to grow our organization so we can do

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,010
more cool things and reach more

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,650
developers we really rely in these

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,750
communities so we're looking at how the

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,120
open jsk mountain foundation can can

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,830
help even more

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,510
- we really need to bring in more women

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,570
and diverse communities into our

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:49,060
foundation our doors are open I really

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,160
welcome anyone to join working on open

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,130
governance is actually a lot of fun it's

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,810
very rewarding you made you make a lot

00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,600
of great friends over the years I know

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,470
many are in the audience and I think

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,060
it's great to grow your career as well

00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:09,850
and finally we have a lot more work to

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:11,950
do to improve security and Trust so I

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,300
