Description: 
	Fully Automated Power Measurement Solution Coupled with IC Temperature Control - Jerome Neanne, BayLibre & Pascal Mareau, NXP*

Embedded Linux platforms power options are described by Operating Performance Points (OPPs). Creating those OPPs requires a laborious process known as characterization. Characterization is usually an extremely manual task.

When we were asked to define new low power OPP for the NXP iMX8MQ, we wanted to use our expertise in building custom silicon and automating software testing to create a better solution. What we built was a device to not just monitor but control the on-die temperature.

We’re calling that device the Thermo-regulated Power Measurement Platform (TPMP). It aggregates:
- Automated test framework
- Temperature control and regulation (Peltier)
- Power measurements (Baylibre ACME)
- Data post processing

On top of being practical, compact, efficient and cheap compared to regular lab instruments, it’s also flexible and we are convinced this can be used more broadly by the community to address different needs. Let’s think of temperature control benefit in a power CI!

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,660
okay let's start so I'm German I'm

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,719
working for variable believer is a

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,719
consultancy company in the area of linux

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,900
embedded so we are about 40 people in

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:21,150
the South of France close to nice nice

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:24,119
area nice people personally I'm quite

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,029
new to open source community I started

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:32,369
when I enjoy in very variable two years

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:36,530
ago and I'm coming from semiconductor

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:40,890
industry so that's why today's recipe is

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:44,539
base of software with some big chunk of

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,239
hardware and as well a flavor of

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,550
semiconductor physics I hope you'll like

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,350
it

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,539
hi welcome everyone

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,570
so I'm Pascal Mahal I'm working for an

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,629
XP I'm also based in the South of France

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,850
and so she wanted police so I have the

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,589
same background as a home here so I'm

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,920
coming from the hardware

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,740
yeah world and move to the software

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,400
world now so I've been working for a

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,580
nice people two three five years now and

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,920
I'm part of the P tech team which is the

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,110
power of technology center team so we

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,470
are looking into power management and

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,619
optimizations on the an XP IMX

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,990
application processor family and I'm

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,990
especially focusing on the MX 8 family

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,400
ok so what we will see today so first if

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,369
we have some French people in the room

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,860
sorry for the misleading acronym TP TP

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,950
MP is not rated with famous TV show

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,500
French TV show so it is his thermo

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,430
regulated power management power

00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,030
measurement framework so we will see

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,659
what it is how it works why we don't

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,829
need it who needs it when and where it's

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,140
needed I will see what's coming next and

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:12,959
what are the difficulties we faces so

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,950
the most important part may be in this

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,500
slide

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,319
is on the bottom here we will do a quick

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,000
game later in this speak so if you have

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,280
a device you can connect to his address

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,680
it will be present on all the next

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,680
slides so take your time

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:46,160
so first question what is a TMP so you

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:51,870
have a TMP right here on this desk so

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:55,650
the big beast so CMP actually is a

00:02:51,870 --> 00:03:00,599
combination of multiple features so

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,640
first it provides power management so

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,819
power measurement capability it allows

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,810
to to measure voltage and power on the

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:14,269
device under test on many raids it's

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:17,790
also a thermal regulation system

00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:20,280
allowing to heat how cool device under

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:26,100
test in our case it will be a silicon

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:29,880
test it's also a test framework it

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,010
allows to run tests and control all the

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,079
test parameters that goes with them so

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:40,260
test sequence the durations and so on

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:45,450
and it's also a framework that control

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:48,690
the everything and valves as well to to

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,049
repeat the test and collect results and

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:55,769
project them offline

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:58,530
so basically EMP is a test set up a test

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,910
bench which allows to perform power

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:05,160
measurement at controlled temperature on

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,230
on the device which is running any use

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,919
case which can be idle use case I'll

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:15,079
give these cases and correct results and

00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:17,970
process them so what team PRP is not

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,720
team PRP is not first an efficient to

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:26,039
solve all your thermal issues however it

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,120
may help you investigate them and fix

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,949
them

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:42,210
what is not either it's not neither or

00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:44,379
thermal policy sorry with that okay so

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,860
let's have a look at this big beast

00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:48,099
again

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:52,719
so it's composed of multiple paths as we

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:54,370
discussed before so first we have of

00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:57,639
course the device under test which is

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,889
the other section in the green here so

00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,110
on this particular tip EMP where I

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:05,009
frequently read one of our nxp

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,129
evaluation board this is a MX 8 M

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:17,740
evaluation board it's a quad-core device

00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:20,319
I'll call em 853 then we have sorry we

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,259
have the power acquisition system so

00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:28,029
it's based on beliefs acme solution it

00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:31,990
allows to probe up to 16 raves

00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:35,169
at the same time simultaneously here I'm

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,589
just showing for legibility a couple of

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:41,139
drops one here when they're at the top

00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:44,589
this one for none for is used the Jack

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:46,990
probe is used to measure the power going

00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:49,509
into the target the whole target power

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,669
consumption and also as well allows to

00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:53,529
turn it off and on when you two

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:58,599
successive tests so to start from a

00:05:53,529 --> 00:06:01,319
clean clean sheet then we have the

00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:05,189
thermal regulation part so it's

00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,629
basically composed of a Peltier device

00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:10,300
which is actually we don't see it here

00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,819
it's a sitting between the big fan which

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:18,009
is on top of it and the device in the

00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:21,370
test and the test this Peltier has a

00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:25,180
capability to either heat or cool down

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:27,729
okay and for it to work we need a

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,460
regulator and this is performed and

00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:33,659
controlled by that is mr. to check the

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,659
91 regulator

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:56,390
so sorry it's my shoe stuck so we have a

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,390
like due to network so backup solution

00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:26,869
okay sorry just a couple seconds okay

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:29,179
we're back so then we are the power

00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:31,039
supply section so these power supplies

00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:33,889
are actually controlling the supply of

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,289
the test bench not the device under test

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:42,349
as we saw before it's supplied through

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:44,589
this link then then we have all those

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:47,270
which are controlled from a host PC

00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:56,360
they're communicating to the different

00:07:47,270 --> 00:08:00,259
elements through us buildings so this PC

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,599
handles all the thermal regulation so it

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,979
connects to the bagheera saw and also to

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,819
the device in the test because the

00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:11,659
device new test also has died of

00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:13,519
temperature sensor in it it controls all

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:17,180
the power measurement using the earth

00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,949
with the baby Backman and also of course

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:26,449
handles all the tests and this

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:33,189
transition between all those elements so

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:35,329
then how it works so how it works

00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:38,649
so I I don't know if you are familiar

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:41,240
with what is the Peltier elements so

00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:44,000
this is a Peltier elements this is

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,149
basically something that is directly

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,120
converting the electrical energy into

00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:53,060
thermal energy so we put a voltage here

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,670
and then we got cold on one side and the

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:59,300
hot on one side and on the other side

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:02,350
and if we need more power we just put

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:09,529
the two together and we get more power

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:11,660
so this is what is a belt here we are

00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,490
using a regulator so that we just ten

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:18,439
commands through the Aust

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:21,709
to that regulators who by Titan API and

00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:22,310
we have sensors almost everywhere but

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,310
the most

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:29,840
button one probably is you are we are

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:33,290
using the die sensor so we can have very

00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,760
accurate control of the temperature so

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:40,400
we are closing the loop with the die

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:42,020
sensor with some homemade software so

00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,020
for the power measurement part we are

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,990
using the believer Acme solution so it's

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:52,790
based on a BeagleBone black and on top

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:57,200
of that we put Acme cape so we can see

00:09:52,790 --> 00:10:03,980
here up to eight rooms four probes and

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:09,100
we can put we can stack two to Cape so

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:12,230
we can reach 16 measurements in parallel

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,420
so we have different types of probes we

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,630
have the jack probe so we can monitor

00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,690
the rule-bot power consumption but it's

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,940
also used as an on/off box so we can

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,360
shut down and up the board to control it

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:30,710
in automation stuff and we have the

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,320
regular probes so we have eight of them

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:40,460
on on this demo but we can go up to

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:42,890
sixteen on each rail and we have a

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,560
graphical interface or we have a pike

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:49,370
makeup show that we developed for this

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:53,540
development that is allowing to get the

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,990
raw data and process it later on so

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,660
let's look at the test framework

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,410
basically we are configuring everything

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:06,860
through a common configuration file and

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:12,220
then we have two software one basic

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:18,140
schedule it's an interactive let's say

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:20,900
like like a shell and you can launch on

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,350
top of regular shell commands you have

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,450
additional comments for the TP MP and on

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,670
top of that we are using that basic

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:33,500
function with a test run shell which is

00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:35,720
the automated part of it so it's

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:40,339
basically sequencing

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:43,399
the operation so everything is obviously

00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:46,550
open source so the source are public and

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:49,100
available today and it's as well open

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:57,579
our well if you want to do it on your

00:11:49,100 --> 00:12:01,220
side come on

00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:03,709
so this is modular so we can use the

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,589
terminal like interface interface

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:08,540
without use of the automation the

00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:11,660
automation can be used without the

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:14,180
thermal control part everything is

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,839
controlled through the airport so we

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,029
have exactly the same interface for

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,569
Linux Android and we can imagine

00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:27,079
anything else by the way we are using

00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:31,670
the very blackness so we can you control

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:33,980
it remotely through it Annette and as we

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,889
are using Beagle bone we have we have

00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:41,389
also GPIO s available so that can hello

00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:43,879
even more automation so everything is

00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,879
open source and it's written in Python 3

00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:52,819
so it can be easily customized for a

00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:58,490
usage so so this is just an illustration

00:12:52,819 --> 00:13:00,350
of that company init file so we have

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,629
different section here this is a temple

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,610
at your section and we can see for

00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:07,579
example in the middle the term title yet

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:10,220
so here we are configuring the data data

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,800
I get 225 degrees I won't go through all

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,290
the parameters but you can see the

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,829
different action so here this is test

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:23,720
with here for example the list of tests

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:25,250
you want to run automatically the test

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,100
boss section where you put all the

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,740
specific stuff related to the device on

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:34,100
your test a shell section where you put

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,680
all the directory with the test and if

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,610
you want to get a result of your testing

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,829
in your mailbox

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,829
you can configure this this mail stuff

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,000
so this is another view of the

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:52,269
interactive mode so what each

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,850
basically is we have we are controlling

00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,279
everything from the Haas side we have

00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,439
this configuration file that is where

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,389
you put all the specific stuff and then

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,790
from the earth who can control the

00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:05,949
device on your test you can get the

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:09,699
right on parity with from the CFS for

00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:13,449
example you can talk with the Acme to

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:15,819
make an on/off and you can discuss with

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:21,370
the regulator obviously to send new

00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:24,100
comment to reach new temperatures what

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,730
to test look like so it's a basic shell

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,360
so we have some log that we want to read

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,639
afterward to confirm what we execute and

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,350
the important part is those keywords

00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,680
because it's just a state machine that

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,160
is looking for the output of the cells

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:46,920
so we just have to use the same keyword

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:51,279
run all tests and this is how it works

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:55,480
so here for example we are running a con

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,550
artist so if you want to see it running

00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,649
the plan was to make a demo but it's not

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,149
possible here but if you want to see it

00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,769
running and try it

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:05,079
we will be presented with technical

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:09,490
showcase tomorrow at the end of

00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:13,149
afternoon so come and see us so this is

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,540
a bit heavy but basically what you have

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:19,420
to understand for this complex slide is

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,759
the test launcher is just another layer

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,920
and it's just reusing the basic

00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,910
functions that are available it by the

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,329
basic Cerato

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:31,059
so what it does it takes the tests that

00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:33,639
are on the host push it on the board

00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:36,879
through that configuration step then

00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:41,339
learn all the steps with that state

00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:44,589
machine and once sorry this is finished

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:50,670
then it push all that in the results

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:50,670
directory why do we need

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:58,850
so of course the TMP is not the only

00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:02,899
some more fussing to available in the

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:06,230
market so you had many more and just

00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:08,240
showing here the most common ones it can

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,880
find so you have a poor the humble

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,820
stream the big beast here time wall

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,649
chambers so the drawback with this one

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,570
is that you have to put the whole so I

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,690
get into the other chamber including

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,870
your poor measurement probes and you

00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,520
have if some parts are not suppose

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,600
expected to support it a person that you

00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:32,270
want to achieve then may die or melt if

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,270
it's plastic and then the one which is a

00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:37,520
closest to our solution this is one upon

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:43,550
this max TC which also works by the

00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:45,140
thermal connection so basically what

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,410
happens if we compare them with our

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,010
solution without GPM P so we have te MP

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,500
here

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,990
then Thomas trim and some Bush amber -

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,930
poor so we can see that the chipping P

00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:03,350
is really very well placed for most

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:06,110
everything so for size weight across he

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:11,000
noise power position right and last but

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:13,130
not least for the price one drawback is

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,130
that it does not support a low

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:19,370
temperature but this is due to

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:22,880
limitation to the PG device itself which

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,230
it's okay for warm but not very

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,720
efficient for when you want to go to a

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:31,160
lot of petrol but in our case we don't

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,170
really care because what we want to know

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,350
is what is the power consumption in the

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:38,990
worst case and the worst case happen

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:41,150
when you are at the higher is the

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,370
temperature so they should little pimply

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:49,220
is perfect in a water temperature range

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:52,160
that we are trying to achieve so small

00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,370
size course is low so you can have it on

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,500
your desk you can even build many and

00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:00,309
you can integrate them for and for many

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,309
into your CI environment

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:09,670
okay so same here we're comparing TPM he

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:13,930
will be at least two closest rivals like

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:17,140
TCU HTC and again some conclusion

00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:19,840
it beats them in term of yeah

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:26,530
sighs investing and price so very good

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:34,630
option so why do we need tip limping so

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:38,200
let's do a bit of physics so what we

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:41,350
call performance is mainly the clock

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,980
speed so it's a propagation delay in the

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:48,190
silicon and silicon many depends on

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,880
three parameters which are process

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:57,250
voltage and temperature it does not

00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,420
appear cool so that's simple to

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,910
understand for the voltage in

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,940
temperature so when you increase the

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:06,250
voltage you go to the green side minimum

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,220
delay it's me it means maximum

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:11,140
performance and it's easy as well photon

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,000
Taleggio the green is on the left side

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,000
so it means when you increase

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,550
temperature the performance is dropping

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,730
down for the process we will do it a

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:28,320
little bit more so high voltage high

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:28,320
power high jump rope EV so

00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:38,100
this is what we call the process window

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:40,110
in green this is what we can sell in in

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:45,870
the middle we have off-target which are

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:48,120
nominal devices and we have if if I'm a

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,490
business guy I want to increase this

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,860
area because this is what we sell what

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,770
we what is here directly goes to the

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,610
trash so maximum benefit if my window

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:01,380
here is allowed so consequence I have to

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:05,370
deal with all the distribution also

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:11,790
spread of samples not only the nominal

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:16,860
ones I have SS F F on each extreme do

00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:20,730
you know what FF mean so it's F F F for

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,970
fast and F F for fast fast fast in

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:29,700
general and first p-channel that's why

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:33,090
so hopefully to explain that more simply

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,250
I have an analogy with cars you might be

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:40,559
more familiar we have a fella in the

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:43,830
room ok so good I will explain you when

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,799
you melt a good choice so if you have a

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:49,860
ferry you have a big performance margin

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:53,429
you can go to very high speed but if

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,380
you're riding on the highway in France

00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:58,760
for example you're limited at 130

00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:02,580
kilometers kiram it power sorry

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,770
basically you can write much faster but

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,770
it's not a lot if you have the smart

00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:11,370
then you can reach 130 kilometers per

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:14,940
hour so basically no difference but when

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,500
you go to fill the tank even if you are

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,630
not going at high speed with your with

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,799
your ferry you will pay the price for

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:25,919
this high performance margin so that's

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,710
almost the same for the silicon if you

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,400
have fast silicon even if you are not

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:34,740
going at high frequency then you'll have

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,559
to pay the price for this high speed and

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,960
it will it will consume more power

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:56,200
so low performance low power high

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:57,940
performance high power so now sorry for

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,830
the post lights but I had to go to the

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:06,220
backup solution so how the temperature

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:09,820
effect silicone the carrier number

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,950
increase with temperature first the

00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,110
mobility decrease we stopped at USA we

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,840
have lower performance we just seen that

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,059
but Deucalion normal I mean the

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,100
electrons are increasing with

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:24,909
temperature which mean we have higher

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:28,419
connectivity and then higher up over so

00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:31,210
high jump low up there higher power

00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:33,669
we are ready in the best case so that's

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:36,129
what we can see with semiconductor we

00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:39,399
have better conductivity when the

00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:41,860
temperature is going high and then well

00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:44,710
even when it's going very - very high

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,480
temperature we are honing in some

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,419
thermal runaway case temperature

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,309
increased resistivity decrease current

00:22:49,419 --> 00:23:01,659
increase then power increase and so on

00:22:53,309 --> 00:23:03,909
we should not go to that extremity so

00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:07,299
here are some results that we call it it

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:11,110
with the tip EMP yeah sorry again for

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:14,919
the slice but it will be better on the

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:17,529
PDF which I posted on the on the link on

00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,779
the years India so here we are showing

00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:21,970
some characterization results that we

00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:25,330
created for one ball meaning one silicon

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:29,470
one process mass specific process we did

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:31,720
some support tests different test

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:35,919
benchmarks you can see on the X scale

00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,710
here so from kalmar test on four three

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,049
two one encore and then some GPU tests

00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,700
and we measure the power consumption at

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:46,240
three different dimensions

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:49,779
25 degrees 95 degrees and 105 degree

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,920
searches so we measure the all the Ray

00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:55,190
is going into the I am x8

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,110
device where I want this they are the

00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,810
one shown in color here so I won't go

00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:04,610
through all of them but one which is

00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:06,620
interesting so if we don't look at a

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,500
funnel port for the VDD stock rail in

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:13,010
the light green here you can see that at

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:20,390
250 at 25 degrees it's 21 15 milli watt

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:26,240
if we go at 95 degrees it's 700 milli

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:27,610
watt and 105 degrees we go up to 850

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,970
milliwatts

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:34,520
so from 25 degrees at 105 degrees I

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:42,350
chose actually the consumption on this

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:44,930
rail went up by a factor of a 3.5 so

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,810
then some other resorts conversation

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:51,350
across different boards and this time so

00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:53,480
many different processes you have the

00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:56,870
different processes you can process it

00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,450
here so we had actually nine boards to

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,390
silicones whereas lost or devices three

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,910
where tt also called nominal deeper

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:07,550
device is the one in the that we expect

00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:13,130
in the middle of the distribution and

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:16,040
for fast fast devices so we here we show

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:19,340
the Polka sumption for to raise we did

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:23,420
ability sock and one you can see is that

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:27,170
it perfectly follows yeah 30 the device

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,850
is how the one the least consuming while

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:33,500
dff devices are the one which are

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:36,620
consumed me the most both cases now if

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:41,270
we look at this part here if you

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:43,640
remember the slide before before we did

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,890
one part and we saw that the power

00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:50,360
consumption and the VDD Hawk was hundred

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,860
and fifty mili watt this one so if we go

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,100
back to here actually eight hundred

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,070
milli watts at 105 degrees means that

00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,470
this is this point and actually what you

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,150
can see here is that this device see

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,980
that was shown before was not even the

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,539
worst case they were actually some other

00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:12,200
of aspis devices actually

00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:14,960
assuming more those ones so this clearly

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,809
shows the the big impact on the power

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,820
consumption of the temperature and the

00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:24,379
process so if you want to perform

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,799
relevant and reliable measurements you

00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:33,799
need to you know to perform the thermal

00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:36,710
control which is mandatory so now it's a

00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:39,739
time for the quiz I hope you guys have a

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:44,359
whole titillating a bit under the

00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:46,960
condition is good yes we need the

00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,960
network for that

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:01,669
okay okay it's working so looks like

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,990
so let's start this quiz we'll see if

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:18,350
you understood all the all what we

00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:21,320
explained here of YouTube for you there

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,500
will be only good answers so let's start

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,510
the session

00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:29,480
so what PV T stands for there is only

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:33,140
one possible answer is it a power

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:36,320
voltage thermal pressure volume time see

00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:39,380
process voltage voltage temperature the

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:44,350
program violence thermal e-bay invites

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,350
torture in you

00:27:54,910 --> 00:28:03,049
so that's process voltage to about you

00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:06,260
no need to explain while not much people

00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:10,870
have time to connect so maybe I'll give

00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,870
you few seconds

00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:30,480
yeah so next question you ready ready

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:34,380
for next question okay so what is the

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:39,030
behavior of semiconductor at zero degree

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:41,970
Kelvin is it a and insulator be a

00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:47,370
surprise conductor see a good conductor

00:28:41,970 --> 00:29:04,200
the register and e-everything a B C and

00:28:47,370 --> 00:29:07,020
E so the question is a so at zero degree

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,210
Kelvin actually in a semiconductor there

00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,300
is no electron in the conduction band

00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:18,990
socially it's a perfect insulator it's

00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:21,060
not to support a little so what's the

00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:24,300
behavior of a semiconductor at ambient

00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:27,990
temperature heat a good conductor is it

00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:32,330
a bad conductor does it depends is it

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,330
alfe connector or is it quiet

00:29:46,980 --> 00:30:02,340
so it depends why does it depends in

00:29:51,389 --> 00:30:04,860
obviously dependent process so next

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:08,190
question what is the behavior at extreme

00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:11,399
high temperature so we have thermal

00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:15,440
runaway current increase mobility

00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:18,710
decreases right incandescent then ABC

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,710
until D

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:37,019
so of course the answer is e you have

00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:40,659
all of them until you burn the board so

00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:43,269
be careful not to please avoid that tone

00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:49,720
of the board before it happens you

00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:51,940
should donate before that so what's the

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,850
relation between the voltage and power

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:58,539
for a semiconductor is it proportional

00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:01,480
is it unrelated does it depends on

00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:05,940
currents is it proportional to voltage

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,940
square or are they just good friends

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,919
so maybe there are good friends I don't

00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,770
know about that

00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,110
but the right answer is proportional to

00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:28,990
voltage square this is important to

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:31,720
understand that because often people may

00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:35,710
think that to reduce power you should

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,690
reduce the clock speed but in fact to

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:41,919
reduce power you should reduce the

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:44,559
voltage and that's that because of that

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,299
square factor and that's why you were

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,730
ready to divert the voltage then you

00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:59,919
have to adapt the clock speed that's the

00:31:48,730 --> 00:32:03,750
correct thinking so next question

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:07,390
FF path are they always the base Pacific

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:11,549
sample you would expect you would have

00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:19,110
liked for a product a yes B no C

00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:19,110
non-binary D a B and C and E began sorry

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,980
so of course I'm sorry's no you don't

00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,420
want to have a referee part because if

00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,060
you remember the ADA Fareri

00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,210
we talked about before you have a big

00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:42,540
big big engine big car but you consume a

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:50,430
lot and you just waste power no one

00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:54,120
wants a few here so what effect on day

00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:58,650
temperature and a environment and car to

00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:05,960
be voltage see process the system load

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:05,960
or a a-b-c-d

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:27,950
so the right answer is e-everything

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,600
effect on dye temperature that's why you

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,510
need to control everything and

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,880
especially temperature because for the

00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:42,260
processing voltage is already controlled

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:49,970
by construction we are finished with

00:33:42,260 --> 00:34:08,270
this quiz with our notes so you're the

00:33:49,970 --> 00:34:13,190
winner and I won't throw it over like

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:18,500
that so let's go back to the

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:22,150
presentation or free now we have Network

00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,150
we can go to the good one

00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:49,419
so who needs TP MP so we need sleep MP

00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:55,450
would be interested in having a teepee

00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:58,059
MP so characterization engineers yes

00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:01,150
possibly for first assessment but those

00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:02,910
guys would probably want to know the

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,690
park assumption across the whole

00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:08,049
temperature range supported by the

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:12,780
device meaning including sub zero's so

00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:14,950
probably not the best candidates then

00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,040
industry working zone products where

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:21,970
power and temperature how important like

00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,470
one for battery makers probably these

00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,299
guys we want also to no idea what

00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:28,920
happens at a little low temperature so

00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:31,660
the good guys good candidate neither

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,910
product engineers working in aging tests

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:37,329
and or worst case conditions

00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,910
that's the possibility on our side we

00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:41,589
did some we use the PMP to investigate

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,670
some issues that were happening after

00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:48,400
days of yeah test so that's a good

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:51,640
candidate power management is

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,260
optimization teams of course yeah these

00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,920
are the right people and we'll use them

00:35:53,260 --> 00:36:00,700
on our energy every day and probably the

00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:05,400
best candidate for how big based here is

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,400
the 20 great them into a power C I so

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,390
we're running out of time so which try

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:17,140
to be quick why timer regulation is a

00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:20,410
key element in a power CI as we said we

00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:23,349
are sensitive to Pvt P and V are fixed

00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:25,420
by contraction so we only have to

00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:28,210
control the temperature to have all the

00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,420
condition controlled so we needed to

00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:34,900
replicate each measurement in the exact

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:37,450
same condition why tomorrow generation

00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:43,180
is a key element in a power C I so in

00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:45,760
the real life we'll go to blue sky but

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,840
in the test world we prefer we prefer

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,540
worst case so

00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,850
high temperature we are higher up or for

00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:57,830
the same test we want to test full team

00:36:52,850 --> 00:37:00,440
so we want the worst case for the photo

00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:04,820
test measurement and this is where it is

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:07,610
at high temperature white immigration is

00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,900
a key element in a party because we are

00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:11,420
getting higher current at high

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,570
temperature so we are getting also eye

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,610
drops and we can identify some potential

00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:19,970
electrical issues that can be detected

00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:22,910
detected otherwise we can as well assess

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:24,320
the thermal policy effects so some

00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:28,820
software effects related with the

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:32,120
temperature we can as well assess some

00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:35,630
impact of the temperature on all the

00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:38,740
components in in the device on your test

00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:41,600
like the GDR self refresh for example

00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,340
and we can discriminate what is rated

00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,340
with temperature and what is not because

00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:50,110
we can we can regulate the temperature

00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:55,670
as we want so we can detect hidden issue

00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:58,850
that are invisible at home temp and last

00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,880
it's important because if you if you

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:05,180
have a let's say a farmer with different

00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,950
process devices with different process

00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,470
which will always be the case because

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:14,000
you can't control the process you just

00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:17,150
get watch what you get you can do a

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,330
calibration phase using that the

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:23,150
temperature as a as a parameter you can

00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,430
adjust so you can have all you can have

00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,560
the same pour your measurement reading

00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:32,440
for all the board you have in your phone

00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,440
farm by just adjusting this parameter

00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:42,080
what's next so what's next know that

00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:43,790
we've we now have a functional system we

00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,340
can start thinking about the future and

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:50,720
how to improve it so we've come up with

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:54,140
a few ideas first is to to go to a new

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,540
path here instead of using but this one

00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:58,940
has to portray different devices tacked

00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,960
together there are no new ones which

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,260
actually

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,270
stacked from the beginning built in and

00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,520
they have much better performance and

00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:10,490
with this device which they managed to

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,750
go down to zero degrees behind before we

00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:16,039
were only reaching 10 degrees issues

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:19,789
some other options as well is to improve

00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:22,839
the thermal measurement section so by

00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:26,180
going in from a poor to the forthcoming

00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:30,349
believe Acme solution on based on the

00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:34,010
raspberry hat and also we can use the

00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:35,809
power of the type-c connector so to

00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,930
control the power supplies and also we

00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:41,960
use b3 use the extra choose coming from

00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:44,900
usb three young four five transfer the

00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:49,730
transfer transfer of tests until I get

00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:52,270
and get back results faster some one of

00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:55,970
the option is where it's encryption so

00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:58,400
with the solution actually we cannot put

00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:01,250
the TMP on top of socket so that means

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,289
we need to have one ball per device we

00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,470
test so before we had nine different

00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:08,450
processes or nine ball very expensive so

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,660
now we are designing we are designing a

00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:14,119
new adapter that will add that to our

00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:17,089
existing circuit and if we allowed to

00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,250
only have one board where we do with the

00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:21,140
all the power measurements and we just

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,339
need to replace the path so it will be a

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:28,309
very effective in term of cost on the

00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:30,470
option as well new casing so as is

00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:31,730
whiticus before we can have moisture at

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,609
low temperature and this is one

00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,589
limitation we have we could think of

00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:39,470
other options like one port having the

00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:42,049
system upside down with the device to

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:44,539
test the ozone at the top and the

00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:48,619
picture at the bottom water would go

00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:51,980
down and not on the board anymore so it

00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:56,140
is where hardware for improvements now

00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:59,839
in term of software so we started this

00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:03,559
this project as a thermal you know

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:08,630
thermal management for system and now

00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:10,760
it's moved to a complete solution so it

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,910
was just a proof of concept and we have

00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,549
we had no

00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,770
for requirement the time of the

00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:18,480
framework to use so now it would be

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,650
better to should we move to a more

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,339
turned out framework that will allow

00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:29,160
will be better in term of entitlements

00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:31,770
and the ID would be to flee to to

00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:36,539
connect our system to the our water

00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:39,000
automation and what we will develop the

00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:42,210
benefit of the TMP in this pocket

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
automation it it will bring the thermal

00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:47,849
regulation section that is missing into

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,140
this system so here this is a the

00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:55,230
standard CIA flow you don't know it yeah

00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:58,109
frankly walk automation is there there

00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,640
is already the Acme which is support for

00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:02,369
the power measurements but what's

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,170
missing is the thermal regression so the

00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:05,670
idea will be to create a plug-in to

00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:13,020
integrate the dpmp

00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:15,480
into this it's a framework so here just

00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,270
to quickly comparing the diplom people

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:22,500
so so so it's more CI than no activation

00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:28,200
what I said the important thing would be

00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:30,660
to fill this gap 1416 solution for

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,329
post-processing as well our TMP has some

00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:37,289
post-processing but not has performance

00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:42,119
as a earthly sound the benefit is really

00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:44,490
here so we still have few slides but

00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:48,539
you've been patient and you're probably

00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:52,589
angry so I propose that we go for a Q&A

00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:54,329
and otherwise we can close here if you

00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:59,490
have more question to ask you can come

00:42:54,329 --> 00:43:05,809
tomorrow and ask us during that the Box

00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:05,809
in the workshop is there any question

00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,789
everything was perfect crystal clear

00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:18,099
yes

00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:30,470
so we these big beasts are handmade

00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:33,200
so we text about two days to build one

00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:37,250
so we created within an XP we have ten

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,119
now a ten system ten to PNP are being

00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:42,890
used every day throughout the world so

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,570
they are used by different teams our

00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,099
team that also used by your customer

00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,619
support teams are used by your some

00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:50,869
power optimization teams of course and

00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:53,869
they're sober some benchmark genes so

00:43:50,869 --> 00:44:01,849
ten devices on pollution yeah

00:43:53,869 --> 00:44:03,530
introduction now it's a starting from

00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:06,560
the proof concept and now being used

00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:19,700
yeah it's a good success for the funding

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:24,200
spin for the team known to have few of

00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:26,270
them we had to do some tests

00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,920
we break some pills here because at the

00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:31,310
beginning we use some regular ability in

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,950
some instead of high-temperature so

00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:36,910
we've seen that we have to use high

00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:39,650
temperatures or wise we melt it together

00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:41,750
at the end so it's a bit more expensive

00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:47,330
but it's still affordable

00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:50,180
it's a sochi 30 euros for one instead of

00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:53,210
five year old but okay and and we've

00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,990
broken a few boards as well especially

00:44:53,210 --> 00:45:00,230
the first one because of connotation we

00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:02,780
we're at it at 20 degree thinking it was

00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,570
good to stay at a low temperature but

00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,830
this is create condensation and then

00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:10,070
when we have a water on the body

00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:12,380
we're on sufferance although we are it's

00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:14,680
hot so the degrees is still lower than

00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,680
that

00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:18,970
after that it's okay

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:24,190
any migration yeah yeah

00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:52,269
we did not sing yeah III think the

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,999
question was if you are walking on a

00:45:52,269 --> 00:45:59,140
MIDI device you would prefer to hit the

00:45:54,999 --> 00:46:01,779
wool device and not only the CPU the

00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,579
silicon yeah so in our case what

00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:07,689
characterizations we were interested in

00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:10,390
this in our sock only so if we want you

00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:13,869
to heat up the whole platform you can go

00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:16,359
to the assemble chamber but this that's

00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:20,469
been peep the post beam proposal pimply

00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:22,089
is ready to focus on one second we don't

00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:24,930
want to characterize the whole targets

00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:24,930
just our second

00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:38,690
yeah yeah so if the actually will happen

00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,970
between the we are using what we call

00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:44,530
eraser which is a piece of aluminium in

00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:48,980
other words so we can imagine change

00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:51,950
working it a bit more to to warm some

00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:55,940
more components but currently it was

00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:59,080
designed to eat only the CPU but I think

00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:02,720
we can combine the different tools here

00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,940
this is more to identify which one the

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,220
guilty and maybe it's about Chandler can

00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:17,000
be interesting for for that for the

00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:25,430
usage that you've explained in your

00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:28,100
question okay so you're free thank you

00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,900
yeah and don't forget if you want to

00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:32,810
come tomorrow evening to do a walk down

00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:35,090
to the workshop to the showroom okay

00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:38,150
sorry we will be demonstrating the TPM

00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:43,390
here live and we will try not to destroy

00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:43,390
