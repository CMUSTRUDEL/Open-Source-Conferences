	We Need to Talk About Systemd: Boot Time Optimization for the New init daemon - Chris Simmonds, 2net

Systemd has many advantages over the traditional System V init daemon. One advantage is its ability to run init tasks in parallel, which should reduce the boot time. Yet in practice the boot time seems to go up, not down. Why so? What did I do wrong?

The fact is that like all tools you have to know how to use it to make it effective. With the default configuration, systemd is indeed quite slow. In this presentation I will delve into systemd units and their dependencies and show you how to eliminate tasks that you donâ€™t need and reorder the remaining tasks to get a working system in the minimum time. Ultimately, we will find that systemd just needs to be loved
