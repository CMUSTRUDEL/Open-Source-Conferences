	Keynote: Open Source and Startup Business Models - Priyanka Sharma, Director of Technical Evangelism, GitLab and Governing Board Member, CNCF

Commercial open source software companies  (COSS) are a net positive for the open source community but face myriad challenges building a business. In the age of hyper clouds, building application software and monetizing it with the buyer-based open core business model has been successful for GitLab. This talk will share the details.

thank you so much Jim for that

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,750
introduction hello everybody

00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,400
so as we discussed today I'm going to

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,280
talk about open source and startup

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,110
business models just to put a little bit

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,949
perspective of my own my background with

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,320
Jim already shared so well I work at git

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,510
lab which is a complete DevOps platform

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,990
deliver it as a single application great

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,410
one-liner

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,150
our marketing team came up with and also

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,140
serve on the board of the CNC F which is

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:34,280
home to very key DevOps projects such as

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,290
kubernetes Prometheus flu Andy Jaeger

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,760
and I contribute to some of them as much

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,500
as I can in my copious free time I spend

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,940
a lot of time on Twitter so you can

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,149
always find me there and here's my

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,449
handle feel free to reach out after this

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,480
talk if you want to discuss further this

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,930
is my first time in France and I'm so

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,350
excited to be here I am based in San

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,239
Francisco and I've always heard just how

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,369
amazing the food and Frances etc etc

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,159
having never been here in my adult life

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,710
I didn't quite know what to expect

00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,080
yesterday at dinner I had fresh cow's

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,030
milk cheese and as someone who grew up

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,390
the dairy cows at home I thought I I

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,210
knew all about fresh cheese no no they

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,610
do it way better here all that is to say

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,610
I'm so happy to be here and thank you to

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,780
the Linux Foundation for hosting me so

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,460
let's get down to business

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,079
what are we going to talk about today

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,270
well the key thesis of my talk today is

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,009
that commercial open source companies or

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,430
companies that are based on open source

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:44,820
projects are a very solid net positive

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,950
for the open source community but they

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,170
face a lot of challenges building a

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,710
business just as any company would but

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,840
there's specific nuances fear and in the

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,229
age of hyper clouds which is the big

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,869
cloud computing renders building an

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,360
application software and monetizing it

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,149
with a particular business model called

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,679
buyer based open core can be a very

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,180
successful strategy in being successful

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,250
successful strategy to having a solid

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,960
business

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,960
and in this talk I'll share the details

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,860
so this is a brief overview of what

00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,690
we're gonna go over today the the SC QA

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,060
framework is something that I follow a

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,890
lot it's I think the Minto pyramid

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,130
highly recommended for people if they're

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,200
structuring their talks so the situation

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,470
or the S is that commercial open source

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,040
companies in my opinion augment the open

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:46,010
source ecosystem but there is a risk

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,320
that they could be totally annihilated

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,080
if they're forked and commoditized by

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,380
hyper clouds so how do you manage that

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,970
risk today I'll share how what our

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,680
perspective at Gate lab which is by

00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,870
building an application software and

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,060
monetizing it with buyer based open core

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,060
we've been able to be more resistant to

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,470
the threat if we have time I'll go into

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,270
the case study of how we chose the

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,400
business model and defined our pricing

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,050
and hopefully this will be useful to

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,640
some folks in the business who are

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,370
considering side businesses or

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,230
monetizing their work many materials and

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,990
also even if you don't want to start a

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,270
business as you utilize various products

00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:28,220
that can be an interesting perspective

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:29,720
to know about so open source and

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,680
business have been so closely connected

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,530
since forever in this is pure of a

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,600
computer fact in 1953 what looked like

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,430
the first open source project by a

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,890
company a to system came out by

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,170
remington brand over the years software

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,690
became copyright a bold and Netscape was

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,780
open source and the big companies like

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,489
Sun Oracle Microsoft everyone has been

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,700
in the news so minute so much in the

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:59,420
last two decades I would say in relation

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,370
to open source in the last five to eight

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,739
years I will say though things have

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,360
changed in that a new breed is graining

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,750
traction enough to be a mainstream

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,880
discussion point and that is commercial

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:15,680
open source off source software

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,570
companies that get started every day so

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,120
let me quickly define commercial open

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,880
source software these are companies that

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,919
fundamentally depend on a single core

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,600
open source project for their existence

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,050
and they wouldn't be the

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,100
if this project didn't exist by nature

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,540
they are the exact antithesis of the

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,090
proprietary software companies which are

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,630
the more traditional models that we have

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,080
seen come out as SAS products or

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,340
commercial off-the-shelf products so

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,170
great examples of commercial open source

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,450
companies are for example elasticsearch

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,820
which is based on elastic Cloudera which

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:56,120
is based on who do get lab and github

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,220
are based on git and there's such a long

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,220
list of in these slides which will be

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,760
available later you can see a link to a

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,300
spreadsheet which has which catalogs

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,040
over 50 of such companies the

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,570
proprietary software is more traditional

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:21,800
as I said so si P Oracle workday most

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:23,360
companies RFPs in my opinion commercial

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,110
open source is a net positive for our

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,790
ecosystem it takes open-source and makes

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,430
it go beyond the domain of large

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,260
enterprises there's a bigger diversity

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,700
of contributors who come in because

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,280
there are different kinds of motivations

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,810
to contributing to open source there is

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,410
two sides of the coin so there can be

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:44,750
good and bad but net net more people

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:48,170
contribute more open-source offers

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,450
generated contributors often have more

00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,940
skin in the game if they're part of a

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,770
commercial open source sufferer startup

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,850
because they're so excited to build a

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,250
company etc etc a really good example of

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,540
this net positive effect is if we look

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,930
at the kubernetes ecosystem so much

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:10,490
great work has been done there so many

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:14,210
amazing companies came out of that

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,720
ecosystem because this cost thing has

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,720
taken off

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,360
so now that I've level said a little bit

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,790
about how we define costs and my

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,650
perspective on their value let's talk

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,880
about the risk that they face of being

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:34,850
forked and commoditized by hyper clouds

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,330
so the hyper clouds are service wrapping

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:40,180
these commercial open source projects so

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,039
examples as you can see like

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,039
confluent the cost company is based on

00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:48,039
Kafka and there's service wrap projects

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,500
available both on AWS and Escher for

00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,449
using basically Manish Kafka service and

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,800
there are other examples MongoDB

00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:59,800
elasticsearch Redis and that can be very

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,320
threatening for these cost companies

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,220
just because suddenly their bread and

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:10,360
butter they're the value add is

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,280
and commoditized of course they had to

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,130
think of a business reaction to that so

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,370
we saw non-compete licences come about

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:20,710
there are many perspectives of these

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,110
Lanka on these non-compete licenses

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,630
there are different versions like SSP l

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,330
there's special ones like confident

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,710
community license comments laws so many

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,470
different things they're different takes

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,289
you know and there's when that happened

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,630
the community's reaction was pretty hot

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,789
there was a lot of opinions and many

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:45,909
people thought this was in some ways a

00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:47,650
betrayal and then of course there was a

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:49,630
counter reaction if when this was all

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,430
happening in the earlier part of the

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,650
year it was very much like biting my

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:58,240
nails checking Twitter every day as EWS

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,349
launched an open distro for

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:09,759
elasticsearch to to combat this special

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:13,240
license that had come out so things like

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,650
that can be very damaging to a company

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,099
that's based on an open source project

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:20,050
so how do you manage the risk as I

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:21,580
mentioned that gitlab we do that by

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,000
building an application software and

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,280
monetizing it as the buyer based open

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,159
core model so let me talk about these

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,680
two aspects and why they are in our

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:37,529
opinion more resistant to being forked

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:40,510
and commoditized by harper bugs so

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,339
application software is antithetical in

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,880
this conversation to what we call

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:48,070
infrastructure software so application

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,579
of res top-level people interact with a

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,720
very you know you often have a GUI and

00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:57,040
people are using it as a product

00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:04,310
good examples would be gitlab wordpress

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:05,690
in frustration suffer is built on top of

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,180
it and so this is kind of the middle

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,660
layer and people often consume it in the

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:15,340
form of api's so things like MongoDB

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,340
confluent Redis a lot of these people

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,180
when we think of these two

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,710
infrastructure business application

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,600
software applications offer is very

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,180
clearly much more resistant to things

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,680
like for confer monetize the first piece

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,050
being the graphical interviews err

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,170
interface versus the API consumption

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,240
model it's just a fact that a GUI is

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,540
much harder to replicate by anybody so

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,740
it's a lot more work than working and

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,140
prioritizing an API based system another

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,500
thing is often application software is

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,360
multi-tenant and the reality is that

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,100
hyper clouds are very very good at

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,040
running singleton and software like

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,890
Amazon RDS for databases and so it's a

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,300
little out of their wheelhouse and then

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,790
finally and I think this is a really key

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,730
point application software doesn't need

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:07,790
that much compute power and for hyper

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,940
clouds the the key business is driving

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:14,810
compute so it's less interesting as

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:17,390
compared to an for us a fur now let's

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,460
talk about the second strategy strategic

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,500
piece in our arsenal which is buyer

00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:25,150
based open core it's quite a mouthful

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:28,730
but it's a pretty great business model

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:32,090
so again I'll compare and contrast buyer

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,270
based versus other options so first off

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,670
open core open core means there is an

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,910
open source layer and then there is

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,760
proprietary features baked in into the

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,700
product that a company offers and then

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,080
what type of open core you are

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,589
determines how you price different

00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,000
things so buyer based open core is when

00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:55,010
a business model is a business model

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,290
where tiered features are targeted to

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,530
different personas different likely

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:04,250
buyers and they're embedded like

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:06,760
throughout the codebase and it's very

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,680
tightly knit to a unified experience

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,410
and so it's actually means that it's not

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:15,570
easy to keep these functionally separate

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:18,790
so that's just a fact you know

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,889
module-based open core is where you

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,600
charge for different parts that are

00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,250
functionally separate so that means

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,699
there's fewer proprietary features and

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:31,510
like single use cases and often the

00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:32,860
buyers tend to be and you the end users

00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,990
which is the developers who tend to be

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:40,420
more price sensitive in terms of you

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,810
know just just to illustrate for you

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,760
just how and how sort of weaved in the

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:49,480
buyer based open core products tend to

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,850
be and at gitlab it took 1.5 million

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,199
lines of code to combine the open source

00:11:51,850 --> 00:12:01,600
and proprietary code in the same

00:11:53,199 --> 00:12:04,269
repository a lot so some key features of

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,120
bio-based open core there will be

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:10,570
certain features that are paid in the

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,000
see of a lot of open source free stuff

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,579
and the costs and tiers are based on the

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,350
buyer so you'll have ICS individual

00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:19,480
contributors and ideally everything is

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,569
free for them then there's the managers

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,370
who have some team team dashboard needs

00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:26,410
and you charge for that then there's the

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,019
directors who need to look at or gloves

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,190
and you charge a higher price and then

00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,540
there's the executives who need

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,060
dashboards that give them the health of

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:38,380
their entire organization and you charge

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:40,180
ideally a lot more for that everybody in

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,230
the company whether it's the IC or the

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,000
executive is on the same plan and that

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:49,300
that really helps a from monetization

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,630
but also because everybody gets the same

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:56,319
features so adoption of the product in

00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:00,600
just grow grow grow and perhaps the

00:12:56,319 --> 00:13:00,600
tiers also enhance over time

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:11,399
so let me quickly share why buyer based

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,760
open core and application software are

00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,830
much more resistant to the fork and

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,300
commoditized problem that opened

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:22,560
commercial open source companies face

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,890
from the hyper clouds well a key trait

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,899
is if a lot of open and proprietary

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:32,149
features are deeply embedded and mixed

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:35,070
together then exactly the features that

00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:38,670
executives want are across use cases and

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,890
so it's harder to separate out the

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,860
proprietary and open source and it's

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,360
just harder to four can commoditize the

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,160
more proprietary features that are

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,649
sprinkled throughout the codebase the

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,959
better it is from the business if the

00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:55,920
buyers are price sensitive then that's

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:58,500
just bad for the business and also just

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,450
not very healthy for the ecosystem

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,790
because ideally you want your buyers

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,350
your end users to be contributing code

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,240
back to be participating in the

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,339
community but if there's a tension

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,890
between the businesses desire to

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,510
monetize people and to get a get open

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,959
source contributions from them that's

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,339
not healthy if there's a user

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,900
interaction through the GUI which will

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,209
be the case when it's an application

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,459
software as I said it's just that much

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:25,260
harder to replicate and then we've

00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,910
already talked about multi-tenancy and

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:32,490
the need for compute as factors in

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:37,709
resisting for confer monetize by the

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:40,020
clouds so I give you a somewhat

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:43,080
theoretical story of like things that

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,089
work but how arriving at these at least

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,850
for us at gate lab has been an iterative

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,829
process and it's something that we came

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,360
to over time so I'll quickly share with

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:53,400
you the things that we tried that didn't

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,160
work and that led to this final

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,900
realization of application software

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,250
being more resistant and buyer based

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,720
open core being more resistant so as I

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,160
said get lab is a complete DevOps

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,829
platform delivered as a single

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,829
application so it's a very big project

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:18,150
sorry all right there we go and over it

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,700
was incorporated in 2014 and over

00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,800
our time there now at over a thousand

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,120
employees this even I blink and there's

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,760
more people in the company so the

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,130
slightest I see how to do and we

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,080
recently raised 268 million dollars in a

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,720
Series II funding and that's been great

00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,610
and it's happened because we've had

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,040
broad adoption a hundred thousand plus

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,290
organizations use us with millions of

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,990
users and we have a very strong

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:47,990
community with over 2,200 code

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:50,310
contributors and to get to this point

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,870
there were lots of things we tried as I

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,580
said so there were many business models

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,500
we considered and I'm gonna go through

00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:01,260
these in the pros and cons first SID our

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,270
CEO when he started building it lad was

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,700
like I'm going to sell gitlab calm to be

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,550
the next Salesforce people actually

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,530
wanted the self-managed version and at

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:15,840
the time not thought that many people

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:18,920
use gitlab comm donations based bridle

00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,870
it's very similar to what Wikipedia does

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:25,230
and there are lots of other success

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,000
stories there for us in the best case

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,040
scenario we've made a thousand bucks a

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,720
month and usually it was more like ice

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,330
cream money for a Demetri the creator of

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,130
gitlab and his wife to go have an ice

00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:39,540
cream date it's seven dollars in every

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:41,610
month that didn't work then people

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,710
looked at consultancy which is helping

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,270
people set up an upgrade kit lab but

00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,740
here there was a perverse incentive

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,080
because if they improve the product

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,850
improve the documentation which is the

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,140
right thing to do for the open source

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,180
project which is the right thing to do

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:59,190
for the product the fewer people need

00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:01,560
consulting so that wasn't good then paid

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,150
development they thought they would do

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,510
pay development for new features and get

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,370
lab based on demand it got really

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,959
complicated because customers wanted to

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,490
share the cost if multiple of them

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,900
wanted the same features sometimes they

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,820
wanted to bring their own consultants

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,200
and then the gitlab team was spending

00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,050
all the time working with the

00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,060
consultants and making their code

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,600
production ready and it was just not

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:27,450
worth the effort support another

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,800
perverse incentive because if you have

00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:31,620
an easy-to-use product with good

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,160
documentation people have fewer support

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,080
issues

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,310
people would buy the yearly license and

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,990
then not call the whole year so

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,200
everybody started canceling so that

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,900
didn't work

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,820
packaging well Red Hat has done this in

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,460
the best way possible

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,620
but for us we figured it hindered

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,770
adoption because the free versions are

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,810
like not as good as the golden anointed

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,370
version they're not secure not stable

00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:00,600
not easy to install it just didn't feel

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:03,930
like the right stewardship a single

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,330
tenant service we thought about that but

00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,610
it was just very complex to build and

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,070
operate and there was overlaps with

00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,020
gitlab com it's just complex so like

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,330
let's not do that there are things we

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,370
didn't try out of course and one was

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,370
selling some kind of hardware absolution

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,990
some data play and we consider it an

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:29,390
initial coin offering but then decided

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:33,030
let's not go to jail then and then

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,800
finally we landed on open core where

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,680
some parts were open-source and then

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,990
some parts proprietary and it was

00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,330
awesome because successful models have

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,870
90% plus margins that's the kind of

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,040
business you want to be in but then what

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,810
is open source and what's proprietary

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,180
want to be the good steward of the

00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:55,470
project and at the same time have a

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:58,080
healthy business how do we define our

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,390
pricing well we considered lots of

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,040
options first was based on the software

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,170
development lifecycle staged here

00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,760
whether you're just you know you know

00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,250
the development side the operation side

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,860
but that hinders adoption across the

00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,800
entire devs a cop's life cycle reducing

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,180
the value of the product it is a core

00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,740
belief for us that the software

00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,690
development it delivery needs to be one

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,090
integrated experience and people need to

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,740
be in contact with each other whether

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,630
they're developers security people or

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,190
operations people and that just doesn't

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,880
happen with this kind of pricing model

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:32,460
it silos people based on company size

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,020
this one was interesting because there

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,970
were very small companies that wanted

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,350
the whole thing and they wanted to pay

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,880
for it all and focus on what they were

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,290
building and then there were big

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,350
companies that just wanted to use let's

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,900
say the version control so it wasn't if

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,940
and the opposite was also the case

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,590
so there was no real divide and featured

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,590
feature needs by size

00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,950
then based on digital transformation

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:01,800
maturity so how advanced are people in

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:05,030
the dev psych ops transformation how in

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,559
the kubernetes landscape are they well

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,970
the thing was that the people who were

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,210
willing to pay the most for people who

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:14,790
were fairly early in the in their

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,370
transformation so we couldn't justify

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,770
charging the more mature people more

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,760
money maybe if we could have tried the

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:26,010
other way around but we didn't do that

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,740
then we landed on by our based open

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,780
court and their tears are based on the

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:36,330
buyer persona regardless of company size

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:37,800
and maturity and that worked we also had

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,770
some pricing fails along the way so it

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,620
wasn't just like VIN VIN VIN so the we

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:46,320
sold the one of the first Enterprise

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,929
licenses so it tells the story I said

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,910
our CEO tells the story of how there was

00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,740
a fortune one company and he was so

00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,240
excited that they were interested that

00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,590
he was like I'm going to charge you

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,780
fifteen hundred dollars in the

00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,100
Enterprise license then turns out they

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,710
ended up spending two years building

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,420
features for that company luckily it

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,670
worked out because they were a good

00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,920
barometer of what the ecosystem wanted

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:10,500
they also did module based pricing which

00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,840
was just crazy all over the place and

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,700
that didn't work so just FYI for anyone

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,140
starting a business here consider this

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,510
as you go through this and things and

00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:23,100
don't under - your first enterprise

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:26,220
license be confident and today we have

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,250
the good better best paid tiers and as

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,140
you can see there is a 5x price

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,740
difference between each tier which is

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:37,770
great because there's clear demarcation

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,050
and also there's between the lowest and

00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,550
the highest there's a 25 X difference so

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,220
it's a really healthy business model and

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,410
at the same time please notice that the

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,630
core is always free for individual

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,850
contributors they get everything of the

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,980
entire deficit cops lifecycle it's

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,720
because we're based on open source it's

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,850
the right thing to do and it's the right

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,710
stewardship of the project

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:03,389
so to recap real quick it is my opinion

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,789
that commercial open source software

00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:08,820
companies are an huge net positive for

00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:11,279
the open source community I think it's

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,870
good for us that this healthy frothy

00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,880
ecosystem exists the kubernetes

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,220
landscape is such a great example of

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,870
what what can be with a lot of

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,250
commercial open source but there are

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,559
myriad challenges to building that

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,220
business and one of those challenges is

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,659
the threat from hyper clouds being

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,120
served getting serviced aft as a

00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:32,970
commercial open source project being an

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,200
application software where you have a

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:39,480
GUI and are multi-tenant and being a

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,759
buyer base open core model has been a

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,820
resistant way for us at gate lab and

00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,159
they're just a case study so as you

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,379
consider your work in open source your

00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,750
contributions and sometimes consider

00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:54,360
maybe building a business or have ideas

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,730
I hope this presentation is useful for

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,679
you I hope you will all keep

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,269
contributing to open source keep doing

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,560
the great work and being part of this

00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:06,079
community thank you so much

00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,079
