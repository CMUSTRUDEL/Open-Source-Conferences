welcome to our open source summit EU we

00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,830
or should I say I do we have to say

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,630
Europe now instead of EU I'm sorry I

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:18,029
couldn't resist I could listen America

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:19,770
has a lot of problems too ok so welcome

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,500
how many people here is it's your first

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,550
time at the event oh wow so quite a lot

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,289
of Oh excellent

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,609
welcome welcome very very good how many

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,170
here people are from France

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,149
many of you from France here alright

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,570
quite a few quite a view what a

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:40,140
wonderful country I got the chance to

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,590
sample some of your wines yesterday very

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,969
very good my daughter actually she's 11

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,820
years old and she goes to a French

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,860
school in the United States and the

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,780
reason we sent her to the French school

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,460
is because she's going to be my

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,910
translator when we come here to enjoy

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,699
your wine so it's very nice we have an

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,600
amazing event this week three great days

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,610
plan for everyone before we get started

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,900
I want to take a little bit of time to

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,210
thank our sponsors in particular Intel

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,580
for making this event possible

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,439
Intel has been a long-term friend of

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,259
Linux Foundation and is a terrific

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:25,080
sponsor in addition to Intel our platon

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:26,580
sponsors CN CF Google IBM ST all want to

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,720
thank you for couldn't be possible let's

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,720
give them a round of applause

00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,130
I also want to thank our program chairs

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,290
who did an amazing job putting together

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,150
all the content the hardest part about

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,479
being a program chair is you have to

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,790
turn down a lot of good talks so what

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,220
you're seeing at this event is really

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:52,310
the cream of the crop of an amazing set

00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,710

reminder we have a code of conduct it's

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,890
prominently displayed all over please

sit here we want to make this friendly

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:20,420
and welcoming space to everyone and we

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,640
every year kind of look at how this

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,500
event grows and grows and grows and I

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,010
think what's interesting is how much

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,269
this event grows with the growth of open

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,160
source open source now has become sort

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,640
of a fundamental building block for

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,699
almost every technology product and

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,010
service and today I wanted to talk a

00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:45,080
little bit about where the Linux

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,290
Foundation as a part of the

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:53,360
open-source movement has been and where

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:55,280
the Linux Foundation is going and for

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,770
anyone who's been around the Linux

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,100
Foundation for a while we very rarely

00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:03,920
talk about the Linux Foundation itself I

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,470
love talking about Linux we love talking

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,800
about kubernetes and nodejs

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,840
and all of the wonderful projects at the

00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,230
foundation but rarely do I kind of talk

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,000
about what is the overall Linux

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,980
Foundation doing and what things are we

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,260
seeing on our radar and I thought today

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,840
I would spend a little bit of time

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,430
breaking the first rule of the Linux

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,610
Foundation which is don't talk about the

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,430
Linux Foundation but before we do that

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,430
one of the things that I wanted to show

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,580
you to sort of set what I'm talking

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,430
about is to think about how open-source

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,450
has not only transformed all of the tech

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:46,310
industry but is now moving beyond

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:50,000
traditional technology companies and

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,040
really is the the method of open-source

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,020
is being used in industries that you

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,450
wouldn't have necessarily expected and

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,510
the the first one I want to highlight is

00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,790
an effort we launched recently with the

00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:06,800
motion picture and film industry

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:10,910
and when you see a movie today all of

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,310
these movies are created with software

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:16,820
and digital effects and it's really

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,280
amazing to see how we were able to work

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,430
with a whole new industry to show them

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,990
how to use open source to improve the

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,090
work that they were doing let's check

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,360
out this video and see how that's being

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,360
done

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:41,139
[Music]

00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,899
every single part of the filmmaking

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,509
process is touched by software and a lot

00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:48,369
of that software is open-source software

00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:50,739
the Academy Software Foundation exists

00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:53,319
to provide a great home for open source

00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:55,829
projects that we as an industry use

00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,829
every day

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,420
[Music]

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,820
[Music]

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,710
whether you are a user of open-source

00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,480
software or an engineer or a company

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,400
that relies on open source software we

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,600
want to create the right ecosystem for

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,770
you to get the most out of the open

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,389
source software that you need to use

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:50,860
find us at a s W F dot IO and join the

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,130
mailing list and see how you can get

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,130
involved

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,320
pretty amazing isn't it

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,970
so the gentleman in that video is the

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,520
chairman of the Academy Software

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,340
Foundation his name's Rob Brito he's the

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,020
president of Industrial Light in May

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,389
Industrial Light and Magic he was

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,600
nominated for an Oscar this year for his

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:22,389
work on the solo film and it's just an

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,990
amazing person and in talking with him

00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,720
what he has told me is we are looking

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,930
for new people to come into our industry

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,060
through this open source project and you

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,979
know in California in particular getting

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,080
into the movie industry particularly at

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:40,660
that level working on films like Star

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,330
Wars and The Avengers is really tough

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,370
and he has said if you go in and start

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,340
working on these projects you know open

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,050
BDB openexr that's your foot in the door

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,210
that they're actively looking to hire

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,490
people and I think it's an important

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,070
statement from the president of a major

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,860
major part of the film industry to say

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,389
you know oh code is the new resume and

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,840
and we're really looking to recruit

00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:06,669
people from the open source world I also

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,010
think what's fascinating about the

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:12,610
Academy software foundation is that

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:16,270
we're partnering with the Oscars which

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:20,590
is super cool and you know named another

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:24,610
open source project that has such a cool

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:28,449
promotional video right spider-man Star

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:34,029
Wars The Avengers I mean Linux you know

00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:36,000
all Linux has is this penguin you know

00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:39,190
that's cute

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,940
although I should be fair the cloud

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:47,829
native computing foundation has 50 and

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:49,779
Friends so equally good and Arnett I was

00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:52,149
sort of telling all of the different

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,350
Linux foundation projects you know be

00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:53,980
more like the Academy Software

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,890
Foundation they have these great

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:59,110
promotional videos and logos and it's

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,079
really compelling and so our networking

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,760
group also came up with what they

00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,339
thought would be a good way to promote

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,500
and explain their project here it is

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,030
right there

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,020
they're really those networking people

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:17,190
yeah

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:19,710
but certainly open-source has become the

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,950
one of the most successful enablers of

00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,350
global innovation in the world just the

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,150
raw amount of code and innovation that's

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,930
coming out of all of these projects

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,370
every year

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,140
continues to go up and to the left now

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,940
we're just seeing it Center around these

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,020
huge ecosystems whether it's the

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,250
JavaScript ecosystem embedded systems

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,490
operating system software the film

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,020
industry cloud computing it's just the

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,510
automotive sector I was just at a

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,580
meeting last week for our auto project

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,370
automotive grade Linux it's really

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,800
everywhere and you know the Linux

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,970
Foundation has been a part of that and I

00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,860
thought it would be interesting look at

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,070
where we've been and where we're headed

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,160
because at the foundation our

00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:08,280
communities are really pushing us to

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,070
take that open-source innovative model

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,580
innovation model and move it beyond just

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,020
software itself and I thought it would

00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,990
be interesting for all of you to see

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,480
what the future looks like for a lot of

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,940
new and upping up-and-coming projects at

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,180
the foundation you know we kind of all

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,970
got our start at the foundation with

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,850
Linux providing a home for leanest

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,980
Torvalds the legal and intellectual

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:39,630
property support infrastructure around

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:42,450
that events like this and soon we

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,130
started working adjacent to Linux on

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,010
open source projects whether it's

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,270
embedded systems with Yocto which Yocto

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,060
I think I don't know where Kate Stewart

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,090
is is now the majority share of kind of

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,460
an embedded build tool for any kind of

00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,430
custom Linux distribution kara grade

00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,270
Linux was an important effort to get

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,150
open-source software into the

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,730
telecommunications industry early on but

00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:09,150
very soon beyond just things related to

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:13,080
Linux the foundation began working on

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:16,860
software plumbing up the stack or down

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,720
the stack in the case of networking and

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,300
many other things that started

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,430
transforming the way that

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,440
software is impacting the the

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,860
telecommunications and networking sector

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,830
and about three to four years ago things

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,950
started to really explode where we

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,650
started working in the auto sector our

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:40,470
automotive grade Linux initiative is in

00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:43,860
20 million or more production vehicles

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:46,380
today from companies like Toyota and

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,140
Daimler Chrysler and Hyundai and and

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,300
many others the cloud native computing

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,600
foundation home to kubernetes has

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:58,560
created the de facto standard for how

00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:02,160
people create deploy and manage their

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,050
cloud computing infrastructure the one

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,650
Linux Foundation project you you may not

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:09,810
know of is our let's encrypt project how

00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,400
many people here know let's encrypt so

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,010
alright good a lot of you it's a good

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,630
audience it's the the Linux Foundation

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,420
and let's encrypt oh it's the world's

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,840
largest certificate authority you know

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:26,460
what let's encrypt has really done is

00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:28,650
created so many more websites that HTTP

00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,110
is the default for and that has improved

00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:36,060
the privacy and security of all of our

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:38,070
lives but beyond software about two

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,890
years ago we started really working on

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,950
the concept of both software development

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:46,680
and open standards development you know

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,780
it's funny the people in the open-source

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,470
community are often critical of

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:55,140
standards bodies and so forth but both

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,600
standards and software are actually

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,510
critical for the adoption of much of the

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,060
technology that the industry and all of

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,590
us require so that things work properly

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,120
together whether that's through a de

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:10,620
facto standard like kubernetes or a de

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,070
jure standard you know where something

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,230
like OCI or graph QL these are really

00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,360
important we started working through

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,430
efforts underneath the Linux Foundation

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,610
umbrella like the joint development

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:27,060
foundation graph QL Foundation and OCI

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,190
to create standards in a rapid way that

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,090
are compatible with the intellectual

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,920
property frameworks of open source we

00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,690
think it's important that

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,400
if you're going to do standards

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,320
development that it be done in an open

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,240
way and that it be compatible with the

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,260
way that open source software it gets

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,150
developed and so from Linux to a broad

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,540
array of open-source software projects

00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:54,150
to open standards that's been the path

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,010
we've been charting but this year we've

00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,640
started to also enter into a couple of

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:02,550
new areas the first new area is around

00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,320
open hardware more and more what we're

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,470
seeing are open hardware initiatives

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,630
that can help people work on either

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,250
specifications or actual implementations

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,160
around some of the physical assets that

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,080
are needed things like open power risk v

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,300
and our chips alliance

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,340
these are open hardware designs and the

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,850
idea here is we think this open model

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,700
can accelerate innovation in a whole new

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,300
way around a field that's primarily been

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,770
done in a proprietary fashion if you are

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,810
not familiar with these projects these

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,850
are the ones that you should watch you

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,250
know just the risk v foundation alone

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,410
has hundreds of members and is one of

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,740
the fastest growing projects at the

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,570
Linux Foundation today but it's not just

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,850
open hardware where we're seeing a lot

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,010
of growth another area where we're

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,920
seeing a tremendous amount of growth is

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:56,100
in open data and this is an area where I

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,660
think in 2020 we're gonna start seeing a

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:03,240
huge amount of growth in data sharing

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,910
and in efforts to improve the state of

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,060
open data as data becomes more critical

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,550
to a lot of modern computing that's

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,830
needed for machine learning applications

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,020
and artificial intelligence we've

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,930
started working on ways to make the

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,990
sharing of that data easier the first

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,780
thing that we did was worked on an open

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,060
data license so one of the things that

00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,490
we heard from everyone is you know even

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,089
if I want to share my data I have to go

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,560
create an agreement with every single

00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:37,110
all the counterparty that I need to

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,080
share that data with and our thought was

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,860
hey what if we could take the concepts

00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,630
around software and open source software

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,600
licensing and apply those similar

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,810
concepts to a data sharing

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,540
meant that everyone could agree upon

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:55,790
standardized on just like people have

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,810
agreed upon a set of open-source

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:02,269
software licenses and so we created a

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:04,250
community data license agreement there

00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:07,220
are two of these agreements one is a

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:10,209
copyleft style license sort of that

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:14,569
share and share alike that you see in

00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:16,730
GPL licenses and the EPL license in the

00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:19,279
software side of the world and then a

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,759
more permissive license more of an

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,220
Apache style or MIT style license so you

00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,680
can choose whether you want to require a

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,810
share back for that data or whether you

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,389
don't require that but both of these

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,970
licenses are available on the Linux

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:39,740
Foundation website and were created in

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:42,079
conjunction with I think over 50 a term

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,509
where's our attorney Mike how many 50

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,940
attorneys from the major Linux

00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:49,220
Foundation member companies who you know

00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,569
are the ones who are actually creating

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,269
these data sharing agreements themselves

00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:54,829
and you know came to consensus on these

00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:57,680
particular models so I think that's one

00:16:54,829 --> 00:17:00,319
that's really interested in in checking

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,199
out we're also working on best practices

00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:06,319
around how to actually do data sharing

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,630
so we have a project called data

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,100
practices org it's another one that I

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,339
think is worth checking out

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,130
to show how you can structure data open

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,079
it up you know create api's you know

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,630
make those smooth in terms of the IP

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,530
agreements that govern them as well and

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,370
we've seen a huge amount of interest in

00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:29,330
organizations who are taking advantage

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:31,760
of those best practices around both open

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:35,140
data sharing and the practices

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,870
themselves we're also starting to see

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,700
vertical industries participate in data

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,400
sharing which i think is incredibly

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,789
interesting this is largely being driven

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,730
by both the energy sector and the

00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:52,250
telecommunications sector so the Linux

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,590
Foundation Energy Initiative which has a

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,220
lot of participants actually here in

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:00,200
France are working to share data that

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,460
you know isn't necessarily proprietary

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,010
data but if everyone

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,620
every grid operator or every energy beef

00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:10,850
rider shared this data they could use it

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,010
to create a more efficient energy grid

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:16,940
management system and that would

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,920
obviously improve all of the output

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,650
around climate change and things that

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,600
are directly impacted by the energy

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,250
sector in the telecommunications

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,860
industry we're seeing this exact same

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,010
thing play out where network operators

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:33,080
globally are sharing big data sets in

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:36,170
order to improve cell phone tower

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,750
maintenance as an example or exchanging

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:42,050
data around certain telemetry in order

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:45,200
to improve cybersecurity for their

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:49,820
networks so open data and open hardware

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:53,060
the two things that as you look at where

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,730
the industry where the communities are

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,190
starting to head these are these are two

00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,780
big areas that you should really keep

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,360
your eye on that doesn't mean that

00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,750
there's not going to be less open source

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,760
projects but these are areas where we're

00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:11,780
really seeing a lot of excitement and

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,240
energy around it so this is really where

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,740
the foundation is heading from major

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,910
open source software initiatives to

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:25,040
standardization if in an open way to

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,810
open hardware to open data that's really

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,960
been the path and that's what you'll see

00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:33,500
in subsequent months that the Linux

00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,010
Foundation supports and today to that

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:41,150
end I would like to welcome some new

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:43,970
people and projects at the foundation we

00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:46,280
seem to be adding a new project at least

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,920
once a week and many times several a

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,350
week so it's been a crazy year at the

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,480
foundation but today we have some

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:56,570
special announcements and I'm excited to

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,570
have some people join me here so I'd

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,010
like to kind of give you the high-level

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,930
framework and then we'll start having

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,000
some of these people come out so we have

00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,260
a new Linux Foundation family member

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,470
that I'm going to be announcing here

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,500
quickly some new legal initiatives that

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,620
are important to help make sure that all

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,450
of you can have confidence in the

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,420
open-source software that you're

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,670
implementing and then a new project to

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:24,340
improve the Linux kernel
