	BoF: Challenges of Low Spec Embedded Linux - Alexander Sack, Pantacor

By now, the Embedded Linux devices industry has shifted away from how to use Linux to make innovative, low cost and low spec solutions, towards a focus on using more powerful hardware to run more and more demanding applications. While big specs will prevail over time, the low end will still be the one delivering the volume and the backbone of the consumer industry in today's Linux devices ecosystem. This BoF session is about bringing enthusiasts of low spec devices together to discuss their current challenges, identify common pain points and outline potential approaches that can help the Embedded Linux community to tackle thes growing issues and solve these problems in a collaborative manner.
