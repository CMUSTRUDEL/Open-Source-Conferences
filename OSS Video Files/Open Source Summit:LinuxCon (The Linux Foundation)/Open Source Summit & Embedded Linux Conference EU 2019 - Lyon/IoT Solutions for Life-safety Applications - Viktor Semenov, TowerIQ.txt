Publication date: 2019-10-29
Playlist: Open Source Summit & Embedded Linux Conference EU 2019 - Lyon
Description: 
	IoT Solutions for Life-safety Applications - Viktor Semenov, TowerIQ*

The difference from the previous version: the previous presentation was given on the non-technical event and I had to use very basic language explaining technical details and new features we're working on. This time I'd like to explain what principals were used to achieving the desired level of robustness in a very inert industry of fire alarms and radio communication systems.

Abstract: Victor will explain what principles allow to build a robust and reliable wireless service to provide life-safety grade communication system to fulfill the special requirements of first responders during the possible accident.
This presentation will show how to accomplish high durability using the open-source software and hardware components and right way of composition and reinforcement.

so it's time to start I think I don't

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:09,990
think anybody else will come or will

00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:12,380
today I will tell you about IOT

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:17,820
solutions for life safety applications

00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:22,140
obviously yes and I'm not a life safety

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:28,949
expert I'm currently not an embedded

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:31,050
engineer I'm somewhat in between so at

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:36,059
the moment I am chief technology officer

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,649
at tower EQ I've been for I've been in

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,290
development for four years in a meta

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,219
development and three years in life

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,140
safety industry I'll tell you about fire

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,210
ground communications inside the

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,260
high-rise buildings it's a particular

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,960
part of this industry I will explain you

00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,600
complications a little bit later Tower

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,180
Akio it's a company based in New York

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,309
and its main business is making first

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,519
responders communication systems inside

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,439
the high-rise buildings on the top of of

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,810
that we figured a way of reusing

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,900
existing infrastructure for IOT

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,780
applications it's a it becomes a life

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,850
safety IOT great network and as an

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,680
additional service we offer signal

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,140
propagation calculations for our

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,900
integrators that eliminates a need of

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,680
hiring RF engineers or experts for them

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,280
and because of that we call ourselves

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,500
radio back office I'd also like to

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,439
explain my personal motivation speaking

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,290
of this topic I started as an embedded

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,960
engineer in telecom industry and I was I

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,810
was young proud I was inspired by his

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,420
technology and I was I was a geek I

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,130
liked IOT protocols edge processing all

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,740
the different networking tricks and

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,320
where when I entered their radio

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,420
communication industry especially radio

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,950
communication for first responders I was

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,530
shocked by the inertness of the industry

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,350
and this made me curious about the

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,209
following if I can push this live safety

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,470
communication industry towards the

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:16,220
latest well-tested wireless technologies

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,500
I believe I will hear from the other end

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,750
of the problem from developed world I

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,730
like to underline specific features of

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,170
modern IOT technologies it makes them

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,560
not very well suitable for life safety

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,320
applications and I hope this these

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,680
efforts will push two strangers to each

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,180
other

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,190
I will also would like to point out what

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,320
this presentation is not this is not a

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,630
guide of reinforcing existing IT

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,540
infrastructure you have to plan before

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,100
you deploy and this is obviously not a

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,980
complete list of technologies that can

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:53,150
be used to reinforce or make your

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,070
infrastructure more resilient so agenda

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,050
for the following 30 minutes is on the

00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,790
screen first of all I will explain you

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,590
main challenges that we face in our

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,510
daily routine deploying ready

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,400
communication systems then I will do a

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,500
brief overview of modern IT technologies

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,280
not all of them but the most most

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,330
popular ones justice is that I will

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,220
explain you some reinforcement

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,330
techniques will sum everything up and

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,090
you will have a chance to ask me

00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:21,020
questions I believe I don't have a very

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,790
long presentation so starting from the

00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,540
industry's features it may be obvious

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:29,450
but safety first and this is not just a

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,830
slogan it's a real way of doing business

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,709
in the industry serving the first

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:37,760
responders it has very strict rules and

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:41,600
we have to follow and going a little bit

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,120
deeper about the industry in edna's we

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,550
face inertness in communication industry

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,709
and this is because fire ground

00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,120
communications are required for fire

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,780
fighters during the incident

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,420
they use it during the fire and they

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,520
need it to be robust and reliable in

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,890
high-rise buildings there are too many

00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,630
obstacles on the way from one portable

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,570
radio firefighter to another portable

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,090
radio concrete walls metal compartments

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,739
anything it prevents radio communication

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,730
ways to go from one portable radio to

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:17,030
another all the fire alarm initiating

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:19,520
devices they are almost always wired all

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:22,820
those fire buttons smoke detectors

00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,010
sprinkler heads it's almost always wired

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,680
and there was a reason for that

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,740
application requires an extra layer of

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,320
heat physical humidity and especially

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,330
improper use protection

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,330
so basically resilience is required on

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,420
the other hand from the punch and

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,210
functional point of view following needs

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,710
to be have to be fulfilled here I will

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,590
describe the essential needs of a

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,140
particular building not the whole city

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,940
as a system so each building has to

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,830
support fire ground communication during

00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,660
the emergency incident and this is very

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,780
essential for firefighters efficiency

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,610
and their personal safety in case of

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,710
lack of coverage they have to use one

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,160
team member or several team members as a

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,130
relay so they do a mesh networking don't

00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,380
even knowing about that emergency light

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,030
circuits installed on the emergency exit

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,230
routes have to be monitored as well as

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,720
they are malfunctions have to be

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,930
immediately reported to prevent panic

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,780
during the accident and to prevent

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,150
deaths the same thing happened with

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,520
evacuation guidance all those arrows

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,270
floor plans etc they have to be

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,040
operational all the time facilities also

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,870
have to be monitored for proper fire

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,920
extinguisher placement and timely

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:42,850
service of them it's not a life safety

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,530
but I have to say about power management

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,150
it's not critical but effects cost and

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,560
for most of the time and there is no

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,850
accident it's very important for

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,010
building owners now I'll briefly go

00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,470
through the modern IOT technologies and

00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,240
data delivery methods to specify their

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,850
features making them vulnerable to

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:09,170
external impact so we can understand

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:11,330
better what we are going to improve so I

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,730
should start with the most popular one

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,190
with Laura it has lots of advantages

00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,650
over the mobile connection it was used

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,470
previously and it also has advantages

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,750
over the competing technologies its main

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:28,220
feature is operation in long distances

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:31,370
between terminal and hub so Laura stays

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,500
stands for long range and typical in

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,990
field in field range outdoors is 15

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,890
kilometers mods are examples of getting

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,080
stable connectivity over 200 km

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,210
in a line of sight and recently I've

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,280
seen in use about having a stable

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,690
connection between satellite and ground

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,680
station so it was it was long distance

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,140
there's a very important peaches

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,910
operating in I am bent or in other words

00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,620
license-free band differs from country

00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,790
to country but in general stays the same

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,660
within a continent

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,820
this feature allows every individual to

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,380
roll down his own laurel network in the

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,740
same way you run your own Wi-Fi access

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,740
point

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,660
lorig a place they can handle signals

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,090
below noise floor this is being achieved

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,040
using the chip spread spectrum

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,290
modulation which is not very efficient

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,190
way of using the spectrum as you can see

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,840
there is a wide hill but this modulation

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,210
skill is a reason of low power

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,210
consumption l and the high resistance

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,650
does a nice so this feature is driving

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,960
from the mutilation scheme used in the

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,930
physical layer which is proprietary and

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,840
owned by Sam tech this is not a big

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,650
issue unless you want to do some some

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,690
tricky things with this IOT protocol but

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,550
Laura Allianz offers Laura one it's a

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,890
media access layer for the IOT devices

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:54,930
which is open and anybody can dig down

00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,630
but there are also some obvious

00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,190
limitations as you can see on the

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,660
drawings there there are too many

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,310
obstacles on the way down to the

00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,830
basement from the base station and

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,620
considering the fact that Laura hops are

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,260
commonly being installed on the rooftops

00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,120
it makes a lot of blind spots under them

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,500
which is an acceptable for all life

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,170
safety equipment management or

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,490
monitoring

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:21,150
however Laura performs well in

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:25,320
horizontal plane but works way worse in

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:27,660
high towers and underground all these

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,760
features make Laura very well-suited for

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:34,460
utility metering and any any other

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:36,840
general data collection or sort of their

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,690
coming to the next slide we are getting

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,880
to the SiC box which is French company

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:46,290
based somewhere here which is a

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:49,410
technology and the service tune one sick

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,420
fox claims nationwide coverage in 17

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:55,610
countries across

00:08:50,420 --> 00:09:00,529
world at the end of 2018 and continues

00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:02,240
to grow through its partners according

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:05,899
to zero business model I would say it's

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,850
Network as a service nas base stations

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:10,220
are proprietary and operated by zero

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,769
partners because of that you cannot

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:16,040
improve coverage near you by deploying

00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:20,389
another gateway because it's owned by

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,250
the sick Fox's partners what this also

00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:24,350
provide the simplicity of deploying the

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,970
fleet of terminals because network is

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,930
already there you don't need to worry

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:32,540
about that sick folks also provides more

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,670
uplink down link bandwidth imbalances in

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,649
Laura but this is negligible for most of

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,699
the applications so you don't need to

00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:42,589
worry about that just for the comparison

00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:45,050
there is also an option with higher

00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,820
bandwidth and higher power consumption

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,600
but offering commercial networking

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,730
capabilities I mean ZigBee I'm not going

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,100
to go deep this way I'll just underline

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,440
its main features it's still operates in

00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,660
the same band consumes more power

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,949
especially return nodes that can relay

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,740
messages from the endpoints to the

00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:06,320
concentrator it has a lower resistance

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,610
to the noise comparing to Laura but

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,610
considering the fact that it's used

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,920
generally indoors and has higher output

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,540
it's not a problem it's very well

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,579
suitable for indoor data collection and

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:22,339
tracking who of you aware of why Sun

00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:26,870
Protocol any of you just raise your hand

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:32,990
nobody ok this is a dark horse of IOT

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:37,550
industry it's very similar to Laura it

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:41,620
has a long range operation same 15

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:44,839
kilometers or about the same it has

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:47,329
similar bandwidth but it has some key

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,990
advantages over the Laura it can operate

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,949
in star mesh or hybrid star mesh

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:58,160
topology in the same way Zeb's igby does

00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:59,360
it has open standard for file layer so

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,010
you have a choice of your hardware

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,640
vendors or you can create your own if

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,750
you

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:08,180
cool enough public infrastructure is

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,089
already ambit into the protocol and it's

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,860
based on x.509 certificates and already

00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,269
implemented there so the vices

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,240
theorization and data encryption is

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:19,459
already there this technology is being

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,790
widely used in Asia I know big networks

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:29,300
being deployed in Japan South Korea

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:31,670
China and Taiwan you may think that

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,220
Internet of Things is always something

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,709
about wireless infrastructure but this

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,200
is not actually there are a lot of

00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:42,410
examples of wired infrastructures used

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,839
for IOT and it's very widespread in car

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:48,260
industry all car communication lines are

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:51,230
wired almost in oil and gas industry

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,420
it's almost always wired file arm panels

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,260
and their sensors initiating devices

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,480
they are wired as well it's super

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,410
reliable infrastructure under almost all

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,680
conditions but it's it's also prone to a

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,959
physical damage wiring joints are not

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,220
always water and temper proof which is

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,380
not acceptable during the fire

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,620
suppression procedures if it's sprayed

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:19,490
out of the you know fire hose it'll be

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:21,199
damaged and the most important wiring

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:25,029
aquire require sort of labor to install

00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:28,160
and maintain which effects costs and in

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,899
sustainability of such systems sometimes

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,720
wiring is especially complicated if you

00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:38,480
deploy in landmark buildings because of

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:40,640
regulatory requirements all solutions

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,410
either wired or wireless require some

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,800
kind of gateway or a local processing

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:50,390
on-site this is another point of failure

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,230
3G and LTE gateways without local

00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:56,480
processing are I would not say useless

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,310
but they had too much dependent on the

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,220
backhaul network capacity and quality so

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:04,310
they cannot be considered to be used in

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,410
any responsible publications at all why

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,670
are gateways is usually even more prone

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,370
to errors because of the back whole

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,490
network of whatever kind its fiber phone

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,050
line coaxial cable they all fail right

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,190
after in a few minutes after the major

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,510
 or fry accident in the building

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:23,000
most of the data concentrators have no

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,560
backup power which leads to absolute

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,149
uselessness during the power outages

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,540
which is often a company's major or

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:31,190
life-threatening accident even though

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,920
those gateways are certified for

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,980
industrial use they are not meant to be

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,800
used under fire conditions or big

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,930
leakage considering all these issues we

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,470
had to look for or enforcement

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,060
techniques here I will review some

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,640
techniques that can be used inside the

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,560
buildings not all the applications where

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,740
safety is major decision-making factor

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,810
so as the inter system a apply another

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,410
techniques I believe that construction

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:05,240
and in buildings it's it's what what can

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:07,490
be used so let us take a look on the

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,320
systems that are already installed into

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,470
the building and comply with the most

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,029
strict industry standards and then we

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,649
can study what aspects of their

00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:18,980
operation makes them suitable for

00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:21,589
handling the emergency so the first

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,810
thing is the fire alarm is being

00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,810
installed for fire detection reporting

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,480
there is no obvious fire alarm to show

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,310
you it's a for fire detection reporting

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,380
to central monitoring station and the

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,690
most important for a local sound

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:42,050
enunciation if there is a fire when you

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:45,529
sleep you have to wake up and go away

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:49,190
the louder fire alarm is the more life

00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:50,690
it saves so it's all wired connection to

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,279
central monitoring station is dedicated

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,130
wiring and central monitoring station

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:58,339
pero para para logically checks the

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,959
system for its operational health so in

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,850
case of any trouble in communication

00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,279
building owner have to call a service

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:10,310
personnel or building separation all

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:11,899
permit can be temporary or revoked there

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,519
is another very important system that is

00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,680
being installed into the building taller

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,720
than 20 meters in New York and in all

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,779
buildings that lack external coverage in

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,209
all yours diction's outside of New York

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:25,640
I'm talking about the United States this

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:26,770
is an auxiliary radio communication

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,870
system

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,190
it's required for all buildings to

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,410
provide complete radio coverage for

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,020
first responders and in jurisdictions

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:38,620
where systems are integrated it can be

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:41,440
achieved naturally because of building

00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:44,920
is close to the base station or has thin

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,500
outer core but in dense urban areas

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,200
integrated systems can be ineffective in

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,209
this case isolated radio system is being

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,490
deployed inside each building it

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:58,180
consists of radio base station and

00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,070
antennas most systems fire alarm and

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,899
exhilarated communication system has

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:06,670
their own backup power and battery

00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:08,500
capacity monitoring this radio

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,270
communication system needs to have

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,089
antennas and this is a separate system

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:15,700
where effort as does distributed antenna

00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:19,660
system physical is this is a tree built

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,220
of coaxial cable and tappers the idea is

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,870
to make system distribute enough to

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,180
provide complete coverage over the

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,459
building but at the same time do not

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,940
press do not produce excessive RF power

00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:33,820
to the outside just not to pollute RF

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,700
spectrum this system is prone to a

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,890
physical damage this is why it's

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,540
required for cabling for the coaxial

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:46,000
cable to have 2 hour fire rating and

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,680
being neurologically inspected 2 hour

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,860
fire rating is a huge pain for the

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,329
installers because in order to achieve

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:58,060
that they have to brick that up all the

00:16:55,329 --> 00:17:01,720
cable break up into the walls or use

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:05,319
special conduits or provide to our fire

00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,860
rated cable but the joke is there is no

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:11,260
to our fire rated coaxial cable because

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,420
it has inner core and outer shielding

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,370
and outer children always heats up

00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:21,670
faster than the inner core and it

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:23,260
changes it its resistance so we wanted

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,140
to make this distributed antenna system

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,410
to collect the data for us using one of

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,450
the IOT protocols in order to achieve so

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:34,929
we had to invent something called the

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:37,330
active active does this is the way of

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,670
substituting the radio base station and

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,700
antenna system that antenna tree

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:45,400
with a network of small radio stations

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:49,630
operating synchronously we called the

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:52,000
system tower link and on the drawing and

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,820
drawing you can see the tower linked

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,690
nodes as a gray rectangles using the

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:01,390
active nodes has several major

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,520
advantages the most important is the

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:07,030
usage of a single pair of fire alarm

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,430
cable 4 back whole network those cables

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,680
are available in two our fire rated in

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,240
insulation and this makes system

00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,280
deployment way easier because they don't

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,070
need to bring it up they can just expose

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,750
it on the wall anywhere the other

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,120
advantage is a control over the

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,160
individual nodes so we can monitor for

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,910
antenna integrity received and

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,460
transmitted power

00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,830
this makes system service up to 10 times

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,710
less expensive compared to the passive

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:36,370
systems and the most interesting part we

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,840
put lower half into each node don't

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,520
worry we are not going to pollute the

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,430
spectrum with dozens of lower hubs in

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,350
single block coverage is being tested

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:51,010
upon the first run and redundant lower

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:54,220
hubs are turned off so on a previous

00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,860
slide you've seen the Tavor links node

00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,550
are connected with this red line it's a

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,980
fire alarm cable and you may wonder how

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:05,200
those joints are made they are easy as

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:11,170
pie I believe you already heard about

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:13,420
power line communication do you ok it's

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,850
easy as pie we use G dot H hand

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,700
technology that allows to run ap traffic

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:21,070
over a single twisted pair it's very

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,890
similar to Wi-Fi but use copper cable as

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,450
a media instead of air so on the drawing

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,250
behind me you can see two networks that

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,570
equivalent from the topology point of

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:34,690
view on the left side we can see six

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:39,730
Linux hosts connected to the network

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:41,920
using the GData GN modems and it's like

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,980
a bus so they can be connected to a

00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:50,500
single bus and there can be up to 24

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:52,660
devices on a single pair of cable it's

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,480
equivalent to connecting those Linux

00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,659
host to

00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:01,309
networks which but obviously it's not as

00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:04,039
fast as Ethernet total lengths of a

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:06,950
carrier cable can be up to 1,000 meters

00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:10,039
and maximum speed is 1.7 gigabits per

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:13,700
second up to specification

00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:16,130
we've got stable 140 megabits over 900

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,429
meters cable which is more than enough

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,809
for these applications that we have and

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,190
you can consider this is a good

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:24,620
alternative to Ethernet connection in

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:32,090
the applications if you need to go

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:34,970
further 100 meters here is a brief

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:38,149
overview of each particular node I also

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:40,070
had to say about fiber glass have

00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:43,130
anybody of you thought about fiber glass

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:47,000
why don't we use a fiber glass it melts

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:49,460
in fire okay that's why we had to use a

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,149
corporate copper cable so there is an

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,919
overview of single node red lines on the

00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:57,440
right are the communication line and

00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,899
each node has two independent domains

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,019
wine one homogeneous communication on

00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:05,779
top and one for IOT data at the bottom

00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:07,880
they have common communication line they

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:10,510
also have common synchronization line

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,130
going out of G detection modem because

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,230
the G detection communication eats at

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:19,399
TDMA based communication and it has a

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:23,139
very precise synchronization clock so we

00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:25,730
use it for Class B lower operation and

00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:27,710
also it's used for simultaneous

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,570
transmission from several nodes to

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:34,909
provide constructive interference

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:36,679
between nodes on the radio channel radio

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:38,960
communication traffic has a priority

00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,149
over IOT traffic and if network is

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,440
overloaded IOT subsystem go into sleep

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:44,690
mode to allow communications for

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,940
firefighter I will also explain you

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,480
later what we had to do with this system

00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,480
to get certified

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,140
using this approach that I just

00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,779
explained we utilize core required

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,880
infrastructure so every building owner

00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:04,519
have to install that in order to open

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,019
the building we utilize the code

00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,090
required infrastructure to provide back

00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:11,539
hole medium for Elora hubs throughout

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,909
the building and these installations are

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:18,500
being tested against the fire and water

00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:21,500
spray from the fire hose the other

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,880
benefit of zet is these insulation are

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,110
being installed at the time of

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,929
construction or major renovation and at

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:32,450
Building Code building's owners cost so

00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:35,450
they have to pay for that in order to

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:41,269
open their building and we calls it food

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:43,429
in the door auto and horse approach so

00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:45,110
we try to squeeze maximum out of the

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,779
infrastructure that building owners

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,909
already force deploy and we added a

00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:52,610
second function to a system that's

00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:55,730
inactive most of the time but still

00:22:52,610 --> 00:23:00,529
needs to be maintained for some money

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:03,649
so it's a stay in standby mode more than

00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:07,970
99% of the time and we applied some kind

00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:11,809
of commercial operation for that so we

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:14,419
did a twisted-pair trick we utilized or

00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:16,669
by the SE we utilized the fire alarm

00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:18,169
cable as a communication line because

00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:20,990
it's already used everywhere in the

00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:23,029
industry I mean fire alarm industry it's

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,210
super durable it can be sent to ours in

00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:28,429
direct exposure to fire but LA and last

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,049
but not least it's easy to maintain and

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,049
in field technicians will be happy

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,740
speaking on the open source summit I

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,990
have a chance to go a little deeper and

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,730
explain some issues caused by the using

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,299
third-party open source software and how

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:49,909
we overcome that the whole system needs

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:54,139
to be certified against two standards UL

00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:55,820
25 24 its auxiliary radio communication

00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:57,620
systems to provide complete radio

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,299
coverage for first responders and blah

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,220
blah blah blah blah's and NFA 2012 21

00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:05,850
it's more

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,830
hardware and same about fire protection

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,500
they both have a very aggressive and

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:15,250
strict rules about system responsiveness

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,169
and failure protection updates are also

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,110
regulated and they have to be supervised

00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:22,990
so there have to be a certified person

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,830
at the time of update so there is no way

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:29,530
of over-the-air updates unattended and

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:32,350
they they conduct or on-site supervision

00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:35,159
and functional tests after the update so

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:40,030
it's very strict it's very annoying and

00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:43,419
in order to certify all these tools it's

00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:45,760
it's not a complete complete software

00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:49,150
stack it's just to give you an overview

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:53,039
how many different systems needs to be

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:56,230
certified Linux itself is a huge problem

00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:00,669
doctor Python Laura server PostgreSQL

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:03,750
server it all becomes pain really

00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:07,030
painful so we need a smart workaround

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:12,400
somebody may say we gave up but we used

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:15,610
a FreeRTOS hypervisor or better say

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,559
watchdog in the system and it turns down

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,870
the IOT communication in case of any

00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:22,600
threat to the system's operation so

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:24,400
radio communications has a priority we

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,549
hope this will happen really rarely

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,700
rarely and but this is the only way we

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:35,770
found to found suitable for us to pass

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:37,030
the certification it's an option here I

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,590
should give a reference to the last

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:43,450
year's speech of Lucas bull one from BMW

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:47,140
so he explains certification problems

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,679
with Linux way more detailed so we have

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,919
a stack

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:56,860
she explained Linux certification issues

00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:59,309
for 45 minutes ok

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:03,760
considering the life safety application

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:05,860
age processing becomes essential in

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,840
systems that decision-making affect the

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,240
safety of personnel or inhabitants and

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,630
it needs to be built around the

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,360
resilient Hardware and even better it

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:18,860
should be duplicated inside the facility

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:22,130
business requirement is to make wiring

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,700
logic for each processing as easy as

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,559
possible

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,899
we utilize docker containers with

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,580
restrictions to offer running arbitrary

00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:31,880
code in response to data received from

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,610
Laura sensors for some applications it's

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,620
also required that we offload data

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,200
I mean a raw data received from sensors

00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:42,590
locally so we just provided through

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,010
Ethernet port into zero facility room

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:51,679
something like that so we just toss it

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:54,950
into the network I'll finish my speech

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,679
with some conclusions they're obviously

00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,809
just repeating so there was anything

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,880
technologies change in building

00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:04,370
construction industry and there is a

00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,970
demand for a reliable idea network for

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:11,330
the commercial applications and Wildlife

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,039
safety experts are secured by a wireless

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:17,139
technologies there is a big gap between

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:19,429
what is allowed and what we need and

00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:21,230
considering this effect the building

00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,019
owners already forced to deploy costly

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:30,470
infrastructure why not to get something

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:32,720
useful out of it and there is a measures

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,149
that can be taken to reinforce your

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,980
solutions you can use something more

00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:39,289
reliable than regular cat5 Ethernet

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:43,730
cable like we did with twisted pair and

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:46,760
jitter vision technology backup power is

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,889
as important as connectivity if system

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,610
stays operational during power outage is

00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:54,260
not it's another feature to sell and

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,720
such systems should offer flexible edge

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,370
processing including local or raw data

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,380
of law because it's required for some

00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,380
applications by local jurisdictions I

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:09,889
can give you an example for what it was

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:14,289
used it also was used for entry log so

00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:18,230
it logs who was entering the building

00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:20,240
and did I believe for today I really

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,909
hope this speech will give you another

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,860
topic to think about and please feel

00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:28,990
free to ask your questions I believe we

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:31,529
have some time yet do we

00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,529
any questions

00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,190
Thanks

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,380
how many buildings you have implemented

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:49,220
or in solar distillation how much how

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:51,409
many how many buildings actually this is

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:55,100
a brand-new solution we have one test

00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:59,380
building in New York and two warehouses

00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:03,590
in Ukraine next to Kiev

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,659
we have 16 nodes in New York deploy it

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:09,639
in New York in the single building and

00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:23,929
it's two warehouses of five nodes in

00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:26,269
next to the Kiev anything else can you

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,260
explain the hypervisor argumentation

00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:35,600
that you use for the safety

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:40,370
certification that's easier if you have

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:44,090
a system prone to a failure it's easier

00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:47,510
to restrict it into the bounds where it

00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,860
cannot be failed or it if it fails it

00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,350
won't affect the whole system

00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:54,799
functionality the system health so we

00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:56,870
used FreeRTOS it detects a load on to

00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,200
the division line and if it's overloaded

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:02,570
more than 90% it just sleeps it's a

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:09,590
sense whole IOT data processing

00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:11,539
subsystem to a sleep mode that's it not

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,809
actually shut off it collects data its

00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:19,250
gathers it for in a buffer and then it

00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:21,529
sends if network becomes free so it's

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:30,070
it's independent they share just

00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:30,070
enclosure anybody else know

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:46,730
thank you you mentioned that Laura the

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:49,940
the rod technology does not work well in

00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:51,980
a basement I can get that but you also

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:57,580
mentioned it doesn't work well with

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,580
higher levels how come

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:12,600
Laura Hobbs generally installed on the

00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,230
rooftops and in order to cover a whole

00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,610
building

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:21,299
imagine 45 story building with Laura hop

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:23,519
on the rooftop and on lower floors there

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:25,409
is no lower coverage at all it's too

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,679
much attenuation because of concrete

00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:38,480
floors and zits it neighborhoods they

00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:38,480
are covered yes that's it anymore

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,559
so I'm curious using the twisted pairs

00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:57,000
how sensitive are you to noise how much

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,950
noise can there be without problems we

00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:07,429
are as sensitive as gdata chen

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:12,240
technology are so it's resilient to

00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:15,600
power frequency so 50 60 Hertz it's it

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,010
also can withstand being deployed next

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,380
to their communication lines like

00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:26,010
Ethernet so we not tested that well so

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:29,580
it is as it is it works well we like

00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:32,600
that and it wasn't our consideration for

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,600
in our policy education

00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:49,149
hi thank you do you also use e

00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:51,340
twisted-pair cable to supply the notes

00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:56,259
with power or is that an independent

00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:58,570
system we wanted to do so we wanted to

00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:02,950
use the same twisted pair for power

00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:04,869
delivery but we had to use separate fire

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:09,369
alarm power supplies that are provided

00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:12,129
each third floor it's more efficient and

00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:15,279
we have to monitor that fire alarm power

00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:22,029
supplies so that's why we don't use the

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:24,190
same cable for that okay if nobody else

00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:25,659
wants to ask me a question so thank you

00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:29,090
very much fun opportunity to speaking to

00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:32,790
you that was a really fun thank you

00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,790
