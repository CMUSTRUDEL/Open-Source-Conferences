Description: 
	IoT Solutions for Life-safety Applications - Viktor Semenov, TowerIQ*

The difference from the previous version: the previous presentation was given on the non-technical event and I had to use very basic language explaining technical details and new features we're working on. This time I'd like to explain what principals were used to achieving the desired level of robustness in a very inert industry of fire alarms and radio communication systems.

Abstract: Victor will explain what principles allow to build a robust and reliable wireless service to provide life-safety grade communication system to fulfill the special requirements of first responders during the possible accident.
This presentation will show how to accomplish high durability using the open-source software and hardware components and right way of composition and reinforcement.
