welcome to the open embedded and Yocto

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,780
project off i'm armand custer with one

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,620
of his two software and i am on the

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,700
Yocto project

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:18,330
TSC and I do stable branch maintaining

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,000
stuff hello everyone my name is Nikhil

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,939
edition I work for the narrow and I'm

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,939
also the Yocto project community manager

00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,500
so this is the usual buff that we I mean

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,149
I guess most of you might have actually

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,200
been at one of these sessions in the

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,370
past we do that at every year CLC

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,129
usually we don't have too much to say

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,190
it's we are most here to hear from you

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,140
so the idea is that we will just briefly

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,760
say a few words and then we will I mean

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,280
give you the mick and you can ask

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,039
questions we have many people from the

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,809
project in the room which are bodies

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,460
here cameras here from the TSC and many

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,949
other people so you can ask us anything

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,870
anything any technical question any

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,659
question about what we are doing what we

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,790
could change to make the project better

00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:14,640
it's really I mean it's really your talk

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:17,640
not our presentation okay so this is

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,240
just a brief project update we just

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,930
released the three daro Zeus on October

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,840
23rd we're anticipating our first dot

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,890
release we're hoping in December

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,860
sometimes the warrior update is kind of

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:40,820
delayed due to some issues and that is

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,820
about to release its fourth dot release

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,479
and it may this one the third release

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,000
may be the last one we do because it's

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,750
going to go into community as Zeus is

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,750
under support

00:01:51,890 --> 00:02:01,400
with serger a 3:1 planning the code name

00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:05,360
is know these work it's working on code

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:08,720
name for it but here's the milestones as

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,170
we see it for the various for the 3.1

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,210
release it starts out in December and we

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,300
think it's gonna release sometime in

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:21,500
April as usual well then we have the

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,000
Zeus updates and some other if there's a

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,260
link at the bottom if we want to look at

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,980
the planning doc it's open to anybody we

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,290
have meetings once a month so you're

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:41,060
welcome to come listen and contribute to

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:46,630
that the Aqua project TSE has submitted

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:51,340
a proposal for LTS hit the mailing list

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:55,459
last week this week best tech that we

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,640
took it discussion this is the link for

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,830
that proposal and in that this is the

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,080
email itself and it has linked to their

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:07,150
doc itself some of the highlights for

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,920
the LTS is it's going to be two years

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,739
it's gonna follow some similar processes

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:18,830
as stable we're thinking it's just a

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:20,959
single host support and no manual QA so

00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:24,620
if you you can read the proposal you can

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,989
get on the mailing list and get involved

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,269
in the discussions so just on that I

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,100
mean this is the one topic that we hear

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:35,150
every time we make above and people are

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,530
asking where is the LTS so this is I

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,350
mean a poser which has been put by the

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,760
TSA it's open it's it's a purpose or so

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,209
I mean basically we are looking for

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,530
feedback we don't always know how people

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,780
actually using the project so we

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,820
definitely I mean care about this

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,170
feedback so that's that's a baseline for

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,390
the discussion and we can talk more

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,390
today or later in the week if you want

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:04,130
Oh II as a new TSC they've had elections

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,010
and three people were reelected and we

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:10,700
have two new members Bruce Ashville and

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,050
Joshua watt they have their own wiki

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:18,980
page for it if you want to see what's

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:23,860
going on with that GRC mailing lists are

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:26,150
moving too so this is Mallis

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,790
unfortunately the same slide as like

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,380
maybe six months ago but the change now

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,830
is that we really think this is going to

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,380
happen so we have been through some

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:39,160
issues the idea is that we want to

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,420
migrate we are today managing our own

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,300
server for the mailing list we want to

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,210
move away from that model many of the

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,040
open source project at LF actually I've

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,230
moved to course at i/o and we are going

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,270
to do the same and we believe it's going

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,400
to happen I mean if not next week I mean

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,960
the week right after so sooner or later

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,910
if you're on the mailing list you will

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,520
get some notification that something has

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,380
changed and an account will be made for

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,230
you and everything will just work as

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,790
before hopefully the main change that

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,340
you have to know is that we change the

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,620
domain names so every list used to be

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,870
something at Yocto project or git will

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,390
now be something at least that you up to

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,970
particular that's the only change that

00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,970
would be visible and hopefully device we

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:33,290
we've been doing this live coding with

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:37,100
the Aqua project this is a twitch

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:41,740
account that Joseph if you see him

00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,740
he's hosting it I think it's once a week

00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:56,270
so we have some links so you can follow

00:05:51,080 --> 00:06:00,080
and sign up and watch but drink

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,639
Joseph is having that morning so about

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,189
that so that's a very good example of

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,620
things that can happen because you want

00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:09,199
that so this thing is I mean Joseph

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,759
wanted to help and you wanted to say I

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,499
mean how can I help the project and you

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,069
came up with this idea about making this

00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:17,779
live session so we are we really like

00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,779
the initiative we really thank you for

00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:23,270
doing that and we want more Joseph and

00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:25,129
more ideas basically so anything you

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,770
want to do to contribute to help the

00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:29,960
project whether it's doing I mean this

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,879
kind of video stuff or I mean tutorials

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,039
or anything any idea you have that can

00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,110
benefit the project you can come talk to

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,759
me or talk to I mean any any of us and

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,919
we can see how we can actually work

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,330
together on how we can help you so and

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:48,740
what kind of help you need to make that

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:50,749
happen and this year we're doing a Yocto

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,800
summit which is a Thursday and Friday of

00:06:50,749 --> 00:07:02,360
this week it's going to be in this st.

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:04,099
Claire 3a and B there's a link there so

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,529
I don't think we're taking any more

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,360
registrations yeah we oh yeah it's

00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:10,729
possible so this is the first time we do

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,709
this again it's been a very popular

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,389
demand every time we go to a conference

00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:16,309
before I really want it will make us

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:19,279
very specific Yocto and open a MIDI

00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:21,319
event where we can talk it's not like a

00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,120
place for developers to hack it's really

00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,949
a place for people i mean ii just i mean

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,339
other users and the developers to come

00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,899
and meet so we've sent some cfp i think

00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,699
i'm during the summer we received

00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:33,139
actually a lot of popplers and we've

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,749
done some selections so that there will

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:38,449
be talks presentations they are like

00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:39,830
workshops hackathons there are many

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,689
things which is going to happen again

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,180
it's really I mean the event for the

00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,289
community as a whole and we are very

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:51,740
happy that we could do that for the

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:53,419
first time this you know so usually the

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,219
first question is the most more

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,550
difficult and then the issue is that we

00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,020
cannot leave the woman because they are

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:11,000
many questions so who wants to be the

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:14,850
first just come and you will see sorry

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,700
how do you get the slides post that will

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,620
be posted on the I mean ELC website and

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,840
as usual with like any like any other

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:29,010
presentations first question or

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:34,140
suggestion thank you

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:36,030
so I'm from the project manager tayo and

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,330
we have been using the octave project

00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:43,100
for many years now and it's also been

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:46,140
our primary integration platform for

00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,330
yeah between the great or solution into

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,140
the devices and the octave project has

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:55,350
been the main domain for us but so this

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,760
is a question related to adoption so

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,920
it's not so many

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,620
maybe it's so fun technically but it is

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,570
a problem that I mean it's well known

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,640
that the octo project is hard to start

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,820
with and when we are working with our

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,500
customers we are seeing a lot of people

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,920
that maybe they want to use your project

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:18,260
but they struggle with yeah if they're

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,270
coming from this Debian raspbian world

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:25,110
getting into Yocto is a quite a heavy

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:28,010
thing so I'm kind of requesting for

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:31,980
feedback because we remember I started a

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,900
initiative to try to bridge kind of see

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,880
a gap the Yocto project documentation

00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,520
for my person from my perspective who

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,160
work with Yocto every day it's pretty

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,640
good but if you are coming in as a new

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,130
user the octo project documentation is

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,500
very heavy it's very detailed it goes

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,150
goes into very detailed like how Oh

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,610
everything is done in the background and

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,970
so on so we kind of felt that there is

00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,880
this gap missing for getting started

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,460
quickly to maybe and a lot of our

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,190
customers or users that we see or maybe

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,310
at the infancy of a product so they are

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:10,279
evaluating and I idea they were

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,319
build something that works try to alter

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,230
maybe then come back later and learn all

00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:17,240
the details and everything so so we are

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,459
launching basically something we called

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,100
meander knowledge hub which is part of

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:24,800
our community platform so we've started

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,889
out writing getting started tutorials on

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,749
Yocto basically I'm covering so far we

00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:31,970
have written like getting started with

00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:33,680
using Python in the octo how does it

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,749
work how do you firing the Python

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,879
modules and and it's all from us

00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:40,069
perspective coming from like Debian

00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:43,790
you're used to working with Python in

00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:47,720
Debian but it's a quite different to

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,309
using Python you and the octo project so

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,980
basically I don't really have a question

00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:55,999
so I'm more requesting for feedback what

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,189
you would think about such an issue I

00:10:55,999 --> 00:11:00,620
mean we are committed to probably we're

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:03,100
going to we have like six tutorials

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,139
right now so we are just producing this

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,139
project but over time we are committed

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:13,100
to continuously add more resources as it

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,600
goes along but I also think that yeah we

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,199
are looking for like-minded people that

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,980
also see a benefit in early-stage

00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:24,759
adoption and we would happily like

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,600
collaborate and this is of course

00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:31,819
publicly available that we have so far

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,970
so yeah requests for comments and

00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:39,439
feedback so this is public material that

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:42,259
people can look at today and so maybe I

00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:44,000
mean so we have the advocacy team I

00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:46,399
don't know if you know I mean what it is

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,490
but there is an advocacy mailing list so

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,259
one one I mean one way to start would be

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,939
attract you send an email to join that

00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:54,829
list and send an email and say this is

00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:56,600
what we have and this is what we have to

00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,579
offer and and that would be I mean I

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,410
mean we can talk here or we can also

00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,410
continue it on the on the mailing list I

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,149
think I wanted to say the same thing but

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,189
essentially you know if we can bridge

00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:13,249
the gap between your project or org and

00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:15,740
what you're doing there by kind of like

00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:18,259
provide a central location where others

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,390
can also contribute so maybe an you know

00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,550
going to that KC probably there

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,370
find out amicable way of like

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:28,880
collaborating with others so it's a good

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,250
initiative I mean I don't know what this

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,990
is about but I mean if it's matera loop

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,910
which can benefit the project the first

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,470
thing we could do would be to link and I

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,630
mean we have the website which is I mean

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,280
the visible face of the project so we

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,980
could link to that and any way there

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,600
could be requests for improvements or

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:49,190
making new materials or anything you

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,580
know from the perspective of someone who

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,710
takes a lot of takes care of a lot of

00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,800
newcomer questions

00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:00,710
the most prominent problem that I'm

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,160
seeing is that way too many newcomers

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,950
try to transfer a mindset that they know

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,590
to the Yocto project which is just not

00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:13,580
going to work so in my experience I

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:16,820
always try to make the two or three core

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:20,180
mindset things very very clear because

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,850
once those are burned into your brain

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,640
the the rest is just a matter of asking

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,040
the right people or googling but if you

00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,930
if you go like hey okay now I've got

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,960
installed this Yocto Linux but my

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,050
apt-get won't work then your mindset is

00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:39,670
broken and no article will fix it it's

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:44,000
really if you are working with newcomers

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:46,190
my experiences get get the most core

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,340
mindset straight then the rest will

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,340
follow

00:13:50,890 --> 00:14:01,160
thank you something on the topic hello

00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:07,490
even about the topic of the newcomers

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:14,110
and what could be interesting to improve

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:20,570
/ learn Yocto I run independent survey

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:23,930
asking to newcomers to propose what kind

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:27,950
of features would be nice to have into

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:33,390
the Yocto project and what are the most

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:35,940
important topics actually use it

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,320
the project so if you want to have a

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,630
look at it

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:46,980
please tell me thank you

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:51,740
we want you have anything I mean anybody

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,740
has any comment on me as I was saying

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:03,449
yeah I agree with what you said about a

00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:06,480
lot of people coming from this WM world

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:10,529
have a different mindset and we have

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,749
tried we've done a lot of articles and

00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:14,579
Yocto project and one specifically we

00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:16,980
did was adjusting from binary

00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:20,069
distributions to the Yocto project where

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,110
we kind of went through this in Yocto

00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:24,720
you are like ground up you're not going

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:30,199
from the top and so on so we try we've

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:32,549
tried that but I also still feel that I

00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:35,939
mean a lot of the companies that we work

00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:37,619
with may be they may be odd they have

00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:38,999
the right mindset but they don't want to

00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:41,610
learn everything at the beginning right

00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:44,519
so they have some kind of product or

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,199
idea that they are developing and they

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,639
don't want to become doctor experts the

00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,699
first thing they do they want to test

00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,160
their AI machine learning application

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:56,369
whatever and deploy it and like you know

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,790
pre-production release and in that phase

00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:03,569
so it's kind of like providing a

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,819
QuickStart guide to not maybe the

00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:08,160
correct way to say it like to go quickly

00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:11,519
to production but Kara help without

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,189
going too much into the details they

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,720
will probably go if they go down this

00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:18,269
path they will probably learn everything

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:24,119
that they need to know but at least

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:25,799
during this initial phase okay thanks so

00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:27,569
as I said I think this kind of

00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,119
initiative should start on the Yocto

00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:32,329
advocacy mailing list or by talking to

00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:34,799
mom in one of us like you've done and

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:38,369
that's actually we started with Joseph

00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:44,899
it started by an email day and that's so

00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:44,899
thanks so anybody else know

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,020
nicolai you help me like a year ago to

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,240
file a bug on backtrack in regards of

00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:06,520
the Uni native shim not being versioned

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,530
and i can see that buck being moved

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,290
moved and moved and moved from milestone

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:15,850
to milestone I'm wondering what is so

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:18,400
complicated about that at least you

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:22,300
testify that we teach you out or create

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:30,730
a bug you know what a child you want to

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:32,230
take you son yeah so I think I'm the

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,580
person who's actually had that bug and

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,130
has been moving it forward over that

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,410
time here it's so and it's it's one of a

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,880
number of different bugs the reality is

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,290
we don't have an awful lot of people who

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,000
are taking on bug fixing within the

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,060
project and there's limits to what we

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,250
can do so yes we realized it there is

00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,660
potential miss you there but fixing it

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,370
is not quite as simple as it first

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,260
sounds there were reasons why we didn't

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,970
put a version in there directly it's

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,380
done through the URL you access it

00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,210
through not necessarily in the file name

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,730
I appreciate that does cause some

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,410
problems you know the bugs valid that's

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,210
definitely an issue but it just hasn't

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,830
we haven't got them we have another

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,450
resources and people working on bugs to

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,420
be able to fix everything so my

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:14,590
apologies for not getting to it but yeah

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,090
we can only do what we can do and the

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,670
message here is that you should still

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,980
open bugs I mean it's not because I mean

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,810
sometimes I mean I mean do we keep push

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,250
back in fixing bugs but we still warm

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,760
them and we still need to hear I mean

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,760
the feedback

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,500
yeah

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,970
no question

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,740
nobody wants to ask any questions about

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,330
maybe the LTS I mean that was a good

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:47,330
topic last time we now we have some

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,330
papasan

00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:01,920
what are you asking me or would you want

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:04,110
me to ask you okay so the yes okay so

00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,000
the real challenge with the LTS is that

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,790
I mean basically down to I mean again I

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,670
mean the resources so we we have to we

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,860
think we know what we want to do I mean

00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,360
I mean solving the LTS problem is kind

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,700
of we know what to do

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,800
the problem is we asking who I mean can

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,460
help or how the work is going to happen

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,320
there is actually issue with actual

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,330
people helping the project and doing the

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,070
work and then there is also problems

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,960
with how we are going to test I mean to

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,480
test matrix is going to be a demon apply

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,670
bait I mean and much longer so that's

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,530
that I mean obviously one that the

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:42,710
biggest you should 12 don't do anything

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,640
so again I mean this is I mean this is

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,340
unfortunate I mean but this is probably

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,080
like very often in I mean in the project

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,760
that we are always I mean very limited

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,570
by I mean the resources that we have so

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,970
anything you can do to help us giving

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,710
feedback helping with resources or in

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,570
any way I mean is always something which

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,790
can definitely help the project what we

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,560
see with the project it's used a lot I

00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,690
mean we know that and I mean basically

00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,160
there are lots of people in the home but

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,720
the number of developers that actually

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,880
contribute the project is not actually

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,830
proportion to the number of the users of

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,200
the of the project that's one of the big

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,680
issue and big challenge that we have in

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,680
the project

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,830
so I think one of the ways that folks

00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,350
out there could help is if your company

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,630
is really relying on Yocto project and

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,640
you have developers that actually

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:36,720
understand some of the bugs that happen

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,300
to be on Bugzilla pick them up and work

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,030
on them and you know and help us fix

00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:45,630
them right so there is a very large

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:48,150
community using Yocto project and there

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,670
is ample opportunity for people to

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,240
contribute and get involved and if

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:55,590
you're a newcomer and you're afraid of

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,620
being embarrassed or whatever you know

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,720
then just realize we're we're probably

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,400
one of the most welcoming and open

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,350
communities there is an open source

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,840
that's I'm pretty proud of that fact so

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:13,790
you may get a terse email from Kim

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,880
Rajesh to one of your ear patches right

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:20,190
the fact it's it's but it's right so

00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,030
take understand that the that it is

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:26,370
short because time because Kim's time to

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,090
respond is short the fact that he

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:33,840
actually responded is very significant

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:35,220
you caught his attention okay so for and

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,850
you know and there's other things like

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:43,440
that so you know put your you go put

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:46,530
your you know your emotions on the shelf

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,770
and just you know try to realize that

00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,060
that any response you get is not

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:53,430
personal or anything like that but I

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,930
just see you know there's so many

00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,480
opportunities for people to get involved

00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:00,810
and help you know I personally actually

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,660
joined this project before Yocto project

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,890
existed we hope and embedded and I was I

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,600
happen to be working at a company that

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,990
was looking at using it we ended up not

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,850
using it but I became a volunteer

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,890
developer and I've never looked back

00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,020
alright so there's just tons and tons of

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,390
opportunity out there and I just welcome

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,090
anybody who wants to to just come in

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,550
join help us you know help us make the

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,560
project better don't just be a consumer

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,930
don't just treat it like a product

00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,900
that's on the Shelf right this is yours

00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:34,820
to be involved in and grow

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,730
and just to put some I mean row numbers

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,790
if you make two patches a week you be

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,350
you enter the top 10 and number of

00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,060
developers of the project I mean so if

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,800
you do this kind thing so it doesn't

00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,740
take a lot what you help the project if

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,120
you look at every release that we make

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,490
we base I think we talked about that

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,730
today I mean we we commit something like

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,890
15 to between 15 and 20 commit every day

00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,720
of the release but we have 10 people

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,970
what you really contributes I mean most

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,000
of the time so I mean it's actually not

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:06,740
that I mean we we don't need like huge

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
amount of people I mean every everyone

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,500
one engineer can actually make a

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,390
difference at the project level so I

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,500
mean everybody can help and and and all

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,660
these people in this home I mean

00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:21,710
collectively even connect you make a big

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:24,740
difference for the project so okay I'm

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,140
asked to mention how to reach out to the

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,900
developer so I mean obviously we rely a

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,050
lot on the mailing list but we are also

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,420
using IRC a lot and people like Joseph

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,520
help people newcomers I mean like this

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,370
is is doing that almost like every day

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,080
and most of the key I mean developers

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,610
are also there on IRC and also answer

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,740
questions so you can actually reach out

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:48,110
to I mean everyone is actually very easy

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:51,220
to each other in this project that's

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,220
actually quite true

00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:05,610
so I have been working with Jacques tool

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,440
for like two or three years and first of

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:12,540
all I want to say thank you to you guys

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:16,590
because I think it is very good so my

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:21,000
question is I was submitting like one or

00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:22,920
two patches and I always ask myself am i

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,970
breaking some something else you know

00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:31,980
I'm just working on my ESPE or maybe I

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:34,950
even run it on QM ones but are there

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,100
more things you can do to actually make

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,870
sure that your patch is not breaking

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,170
something else like there are auto bills

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:45,360
or something

00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:48,480
so maybe HR we had something what we can

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,610
say every I mean every patch which is on

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,140
mailing list which is good enough to be

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:55,080
maybe merged is actually going through

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,060
the auto builders so there is a huge IT

00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,610
infrastructure behind the project and

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,990
everything is there is the auto builder

00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,840
that where we actually test all the

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:05,580
combination that you did not test so I

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,590
mean which are maybe you can explain

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,770
when you when you decide to may take a

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:12,240
patch into the a B yeah well pretty much

00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,860
any patch that we are thinking about

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,720
taking goes into the auto builder and

00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,430
gets tested all of those test

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,750
configurations are actually public and

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,450
there are test cases that you can

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,860
actually run by hand so for example if

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,780
you were changing something like recipe

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,370
tool or dev tool there's specific test

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,470
Suites that can be used with those and

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:32,700
it's a command line along the lines of

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:34,230
oh aid are self test - our recipe tool

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,340
or something like that which is like the

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,160
module name of the thing that we're

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,840
testing and I think my ask my suggestion

00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,910
is if you're making changes in any of

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,790
these areas help us out new tests

00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,890
because even if there's no tests there

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,180
currently if you add your tests in that

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,830
means that whatever it is that you just

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,420
fixed will hopefully not regress again

00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,640
because if we've got tests that we'll be

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,590
able to check that in future so test

00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,270
adding new test cases is something that

00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,250
we're starting to sort of ask for with

00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,420
new contributions particularly in areas

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,050
of the project which we don't

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,950
necessarily know an awful lot about

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,330
because but this is one of the

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,890
challenges the project can be configured

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,260
in so many different ways with so many

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,120
different options how do you test it

00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,260
and the way we do that is through things

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,580
like though a self test and those

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,170
modules so did you know about the ATO

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:26,850
builders I mean did you know that we had

00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:28,740
one okay so maybe one thing we could do

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,450
I mean we have a how to submit a patch I

00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,370
think's on one of the wiki so we could

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,290
actually explain I mean not only how to

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,180
submit a patch but what happens once you

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,380
submit a patch like maybe I'm in this

00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,120
kind of thing I mean this is actually an

00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,800
interesting feedback I think you

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,630
shouldn't I mean I mean not everybody

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,920
knows that stuff so maybe we should have

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,530
another section in that quickly that

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,300
says once you submitted a patch and I

00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,340
mean of course if the part if there is a

00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,350
review comments or anything the patch is

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,700
not okay I mean that's but then if the

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,470
patch is okay I mean there is a whole

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,360
life cycle for this patch which we

00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,740
probably could document at least you

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,030
should have a link to the auto builders

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,050
and the process that before it's I was

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,640
just gonna say in the altar builder

00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,890
process for those who don't know about

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,300
it it takes roughly about six hours to

00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,100
come through it but we do with the

00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,650
patches in batches because we can't

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,840
afford the CPU cycles to basically test

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,310
things individually so it is a manual

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,560
process to collect things up and trigger

00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:24,870
it and it's done in batches of roughly

00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:26,580
around 30 to 60 patches or so yes and

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,380
then so that it's build tests it's also

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,820
run timed test so we do test a lot of

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,150
the things under key Mew including

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,260
things like P test packages for

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,670
components within those those images

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,710
which is why we're running the upstream

00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,710
tests related to a computer software

00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,460
that stable branches go through the same

00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:48,159
process when we're back port patches we

00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:51,340
use the same infrastructure and QA tests

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,990
and stuff so sometimes you don't

00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,870
actually see any response on the mailing

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,549
list because your patch was basically

00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,409
you know nobody had any major comments

00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,360
and they brought it in to you a master

00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,970
next branch so what you should be

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,380
looking for is in the repository that

00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,200
you're committing to or you're sending a

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:12,159
patch for look for it to be landing in

00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,500
the master next and you will usually

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,230
hear feedback if it broke something and

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,480
then you know then otherwise it often

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,889
tends to be merged the reality is we

00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,899
don't have enough manpower to be

00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:25,000
reviewing every single patch and you

00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:26,769
know really responding the other thing

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,200
is if you're talking about a given

00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:32,409
recipe or a given package and not part

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,610
of the core tooling if you just simply

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:39,490
run on you know qmu x86 kiyomi arm you

00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:41,559
know there's five or six queues that are

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,059
that are more than that but anyway you

00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,759
can run on all of them if you if you

00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:47,259
like but if you want to just do some

00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,480
basic sanity checking that you haven't

00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:54,580
broken anything at least run on on the

00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,110
two main QM use the other thing is Kim

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,539
would really love it if you would also

00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,850
build it with muscle because this is one

00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:03,820
of the things that that is most likely

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,440
to break so you know any patch you're

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,529
gonna do to a given recipe or whatever

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,750
it is it is highly likely that muscle

00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:13,029
will have issues with it and so just you

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:17,200
know do us all a favor and actually look

00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:19,269
at that there's many many ways of doing

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,539
the you know your own automation and

00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:24,789
your own testing and so on

00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,629
so in the doctor project summit I'm

00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:28,120
actually going to be talking about

00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:31,389
result tool and I'm gonna talk about pee

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:34,210
test and Oh a self-test stuff so I'll be

00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:36,340
giving at least a light view of what all

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,100
those mean how you run it you know what

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,570
it what it takes and many of these tests

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,639
are quite easy to run just from the

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,710
command line or something like that so

00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:47,009
it's there's quite a bit you can do on

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,009
your own

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:54,250
yeah I was just gonna I was just gonna

00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,380
say that from my personal experience the

00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,450
outer builder code is there as well

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,929
it's a repo you can clone it you can

00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:05,470
create your own CI on that and all the

00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:08,020
the matrix of different combinations

00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,920
that are tested they're there so you

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:15,429
technically be half time you can just

00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,320
load your own auto builder and put it

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:20,290
around at night and you know you're not

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,300
breaking anyone else's things with your

00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:26,050
patch right you just use your branch

00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:28,450
instead and yeah that's pretty much it

00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:31,330
you can do it you can the auto builder

00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,340
publishes the downloads and a state as

00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,929
well so if you can configure it with

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,760
that it's not even going to take that

00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:42,630
long even though it's not a perfect test

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,630
for a newcomer but

00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,940
okay

00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:00,419
thank you again you can attend my talk

00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:06,200
on Friday and learn how to strengthen

00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:06,200
your Yocto deployments

00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:22,770
yeah thanks so the openembedded website

00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:25,440
lists a lot of layers available and my

00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:29,130
question is does this outer testing

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,880
involve the those layers there might be

00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:34,919
out of you know like not in the core

00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,220
because I'm looking for some features

00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,309
you look for layers and some of layers

00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:44,789
are actually not maintained or not not

00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:49,200
that not in sync have no like a branch

00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:53,370
which matches the the Yocto release so

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,950
how is it handled so I guess you are

00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:58,470
talking about the layer index which is a

00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:01,169
really good tool that exists on layers

00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,120
that open in MIDI dot org that I mean

00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,740
everybody is free to submit which if you

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,080
have your own layer you can submit that

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,520
there is a light process where we give

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,830
you I mean that the content of the layer

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,809
is I mean it's actually yeah I mean it's

00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,490
not something that is going to break

00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:16,350
everything and then we just publish

00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,419
solving and we don't do any specific

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,370
tests on what is published on the on the

00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,020
layers if the main turn of the layer

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,780
does not provide the release branch

00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,669
phone but you need I mean that's your

00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,409
mean you can ask the maintainer but we

00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:30,630
don't do anything in terms of the

00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:34,020
testing what we'd mention with the auto

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,820
builder is for what is on the on the on

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:39,059
the call sign so it's it's basically an

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:42,600
pockit to some extent there are also I

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:45,179
mean CI that happens with more layers

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,559
inside you open embedded and may become

00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,320
you want to talk about what you are

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,360
doing yeah so I think right now I think

00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,179
we're working on primarily you know

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,039
bunch of servers that we have an open

00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,809
embedded so we don't do any of the

00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,760
runtime tests given you know the number

00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:04,830
of layers there are and number of large

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:07,049
packages the turnaround time is too big

00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:10,799
like even for the bills is run like 12

00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:12,870
hours for one bill so but I'm kind of

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,549
like we're working with the Yocto

00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:17,850
project where we have now started to

00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:20,760
some projects to kind of integrate more

00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:25,710
layers this is essentially the so this

00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,090
the mat open embed layers so you know

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,640
like regularly building them

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,620
as well so I think eventually I do have

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,120
plans to add more like pts kind of

00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,590
things in there depending upon how much

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,680
resources we have there so I'm kind of

00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:42,840
looking at how much s state it is using

00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,310
from you know the master bills which is

00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,930
pretty good right now pretty encouraging

00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:49,770
so I'm at opening Barry bill stone take

00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:51,780
that longer on a B so you know we might

00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,970
have more tests like runtime tests as

00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,010
well in future I don't know depends like

00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:58,260
on participation but right now that's

00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,670
what we do and I think there are

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,590
individual layers that you have on

00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,270
github or other places then you have to

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,630
go and talk to those maintainer sand

00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:08,850
maybe there's many layers they keep

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,270
their master working on multiple

00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:14,370
releases so you might not see a third

00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:17,670
release but the master of that project

00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:19,950
is still built with that right so I know

00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:22,740
that matter browser is that way right so

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,140
you might want to check with the

00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:27,840
maintainer they have different policies

00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:34,140
you may not have like exact branch you

00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:35,730
know back to the auger question I mean

00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,890
what we described earlier with the

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,870
process of the patch and EAB and so on

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:43,190
is is for things that go into the core I

00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,190
mean the Kali

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,919
that's fine I can do that

00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:01,510
so is that the only woman leaving the

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,770
room right there

00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:10,340
we got that too well besides us oh and

00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:12,020
you so first of all I wanted to say that

00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,970
I've never seen chem right more than a

00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,190
sentence so don't take it personally at

00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:19,190
all ever and in fact he asked Richard

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:22,130
today if Richard could possibly do the

00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,940
weekly status reports and 240 characters

00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:29,150
or less

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:32,300
Oh 140 sorry 140 yeah so you guys have

00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,290
no sense of humor at all I can't believe

00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,180
it

00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,410
I wanted to say a couple of things I

00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,880
know today I don't know if you guys

00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,130
brought this up I was a little bit late

00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,900
we were talking about the planning

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:45,110
meetings for Yocto project for the next

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,940
Rev did you talk about that at all so I

00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,260
don't really know that much about them I

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:55,490
know they take place

00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:57,680
are they weekly weekly it doesn't matter

00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,330
you can figure out how often Tim's going

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,040
to tell because he can't stand it when I

00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:03,470
give the wrong information but my point

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:07,450
is that there's this really unique

00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:10,160
opportunity for you guys to show up and

00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:12,020
input on what you want out of the

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,970
project and what you think is important

00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,660
and what directions it should go in and

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,980
what you really need and I think a lot

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,990
of people don't take advantage of that

00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,550
and I think it's super super important

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,260
for people who don't have a sense of

00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:28,580
humor to show up at the planning

00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:30,050
meetings and an input some stuff so I

00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,670
know there are things that are important

00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,050
to you and it's possible that they're

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:35,210
just not getting into the project

00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:38,870
because no one knows and then the other

00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:40,850
thing which is much more simple is we

00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:42,740
have a really cool thing on the Yocto

00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:46,700
project website where you can advertise

00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,990
jobs so if any of you have a position in

00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,580
your company that you'd like to have

00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:52,700
advertised other Yocto project

00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:55,490
openembedded people it's another place

00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,140
you can do so and so you just send it in

00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,060
- I think there's a link on the website

00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,560
somewhere to the webmaster you could

00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:06,200
send it to anywhere we'd be happy to

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:08,870
post it and happy to post it yeah okay

00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,980
thank you so yeah so that was a good day

00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,510
I need to talk about the

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,010
meetings the project has a couple of

00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:18,500
meetings there is an engineering wiki

00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,510
quickly and which I mean it's I mean

00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,640
anyone can join and attend and just try

00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,350
to contribute to the project one thing

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,650
which is to link to what we are how we

00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:29,150
started we sometimes feel that we are

00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,470
missing feedback from the users I mean

00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,060
we have very good feedback from the

00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,770
developers I mean that we know all of

00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,510
them but we are missing feedback from

00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:38,210
the user so what Tracy was saying is

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,770
that if you want to I mean one way to

00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,390
contribute to the project is to explain

00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,680
how you use the project and what you

00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,119
expect from the project because

00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,600
sometimes we don't even know what I mean

00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,890
you expect and we've seen sometimes we

00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,480
are surprised but what people are

00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,700
actually doing with a project but we

00:37:50,480 --> 00:38:01,359
often learn that after the fact and not

00:37:52,700 --> 00:38:01,359
that's not early enough no phone calls

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,859
there's essentially two meetings that

00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:12,290
happen every week one of them is once a

00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:14,869
month is the monthly technical call but

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:17,960
the rest of the time the same zoom

00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:20,030
number is used for the same timeslot and

00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:25,310
that's the engineering sync call and

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:26,359
that has in the past been all kinds of

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,010
different things talking about

00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:31,190
infrastructure and things like that that

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,240
it has recently become a catch-all for

00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,790
where we just talk about whatever

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,990
happens to be going on the other meeting

00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,450
that happens every week is the bug

00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:40,190
triage meeting which is on Thursdays so

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,020
the technical calls on Tuesdays the bug

00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:46,150
triage is on Thursdays I will not try to

00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:48,770
do the EU timezone translation but

00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:52,280
because I'm from California or from the

00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:54,050
west coast sorry so the bug triage call

00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,119
is where we look at the new bugs that

00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,119
have come in during that week that have

00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,890
been added to Bugzilla and we triage

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,080
them and figure out what priority and

00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:04,460
everything to add them to attempt to

00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,200
figure out who is going to work on them

00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,960
if they are high-priority and things

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,730
like that and then we also look at the

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,200
old bugs and things like that and try to

00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:16,040
make sure we're taking care of them and

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,340
you know keeping things healthy we can

00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,210
absolutely use a lot more help in

00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:23,030
Bugzilla and in that

00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,619
space so we would recommend anybody that

00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:28,670
wants to you to join either one of those

00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:30,470
calls and listen in get a feel for what

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:38,869
the meanings are about and bring up

00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:40,670
issues that you might have any other

00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:42,560
questions we are already running out of

00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:46,339
time and I thought we had more than that

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,200
but but no one nobody has kicked us out

00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:51,530
anyway so if if there are more questions

00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:58,880

00:39:51,530 --> 00:40:01,280
