	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
hello good morning I'm so excited to be

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,030
here there's nothing I love more than

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,179
being in person with other people that

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,379
kind of love technology as much as I do

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,070
so I think I'm going to preface my

00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:18,990
presentation today with a little bit of

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,779
an explanation because as a digital

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,970
anthropologist I run a think tank based

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,859
in Paris I specialize in research about

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,769
emerging technologies artificial

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,789
intelligence but today I'm going to talk

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,099
to you about something a little bit

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,210
different which is a whole other field

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,160
that I've fallen into and that is the

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,500
subject of the book book that I had

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,670
written earlier this year called Hustle

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,280
& Flow so a couple of years ago I

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:51,030
experienced an episode of burnout that

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,430
was so severe and so debilitating that I

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,379
couldn't work for several months and

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,550
this experience was absolutely

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,050
terrifying

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,000
hair loss insomnia depression and this

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,729
experiences I recovered which took

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,490
months really forced me to rethink

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,090
everything that I thought I knew about

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,659
work and about success and about

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,070
productivity and one of the things and

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,799
one of the questions that kept coming

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,439
around and back around was why did this

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,869
happen to me because you know as a

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,900
researcher as a technologist I was

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,939
somebody that was quite aware of all the

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,280
things that we needed to do in order to

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,110
work better I wasn't going to it was one

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,040
of those people that didn't understand

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,659
what brakes were what rest was but I

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,409
kept coming back to this question like I

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,960
knew better so why did this happen to me

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,820
and in trying to answer that question I

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,770
realized that instead of asking myself

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,960
what could I be doing to work better

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,240
because there's no shortage of apps and

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,280
strategies and frameworks that what I

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,430
actually needed to be asking myself was

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,810
why wasn't I doing it and trying to

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,790
answer this question led me on a

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,039
three-year research project that ended

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,349
up unpackaging the cultural heritage

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,710
that we all have created around the

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:16,830
ideas of work but with specific focus

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,440
on knowledge workers and our very

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,560
complicated history with hustle culture

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,810
especially for those of us that like to

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,580
embody much of the values that are

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,690
embedded in startup culture and some of

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,290
the things that we read in the media

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,520
which I'll go into today so I want to

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,620
talk to you a little bit about this

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,620
research and about what our relationship

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,570
with work means for the tools that we're

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,120
building and the digital culture were

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,580
creating as well as what it means for

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,030
our ability as professionals to produce

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,100
our best quality of work and in order to

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,100
do that we kind of have to go back in

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,020
history and look at how our thinking

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,820
around concepts of productivity and

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,710
creativity have changed over the years

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,330
and people always get surprised when I'm

00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,950
at a technology conference we want to be

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,260
forward-looking you know why are we

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,910
gonna talk about the past and I think in

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,610
order to know where we're going we have

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,470
to understand how our past has shaped us

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,230
in the way that we live and work today

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,270
so the minutes is gonna be very quick a

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,110
very quick historical overview but

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,000
productivity as a as a discipline the

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,100
way that we talk about it in a work

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,230
context today was originally created by

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,120
armies and governments that had to

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,060
manage large groups of people that were

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,430
doing highly standardized tasks many of

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,870
these methodologies were adopted by

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,610
businesses during the Industrial

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,010
Revolution where people went into

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,460
factories and assembly lines and they

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,810
were also doing highly repeatable tasks

00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,120
our work today looks a little bit

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,010
different but what's interesting is that

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,560
today it's individuals that have adopted

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,690
many of these philosophies of what it

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,540
means to be a productive worker and

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,510
today culturally productivity has become

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,190
an individual pursuit when we survey

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,590
people during the research for this book

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,330
people told us that productivity was one

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,670
of the highest-ranked skill sets that

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,650
they wanted to improve and more

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,110
importantly people said that

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,420
productivity or a person's level of

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,430
productivity was a key indicator to

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,810
their future success meaning if you were

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,460
considered to be highly productive

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,790
people thought you had a much higher

00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:23,220
chance of being successful so put that

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,169
aside for a second while all of this

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,580
productivity thinking was changing and

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,600
becoming into the domain of the

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,150
individual

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,980
are thinking about creativity has gone

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,830
fundamental changes that might actually

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,640
surprise you so I'm gonna try to cram in

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,830
about 400 years worth of history in

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,810
about 90 seconds so you might be

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,930
surprised to note that during the

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,060
ancient Greek and Roman empires people

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,820
didn't think that human beings could be

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,490
creative being creative was something

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,310
that was seen as outside of our skill

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,920
set outside of our ability if you had an

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,440
idea if you created art if you built a

00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,170
statue or built a structure that wasn't

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,170
you that was the gods that were working

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,840
through you it was divine inspiration so

00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,120
creativity was seen as a gift a gift

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,190
from a divine source and we see a lot of

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,810
that remanence a lot of the traces of

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,120
that thinking today especially when we

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,410
talk about things like the muses or you

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,050
know finding that creative inspiration

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,930
or having content or informations being

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,450
downloaded to us from another source so

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,580
that view persisted for hundreds of

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,860
years up until the Enlightenment during

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,180
the 17th or 18th century and the

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,910
romantics they said wait a minute

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,890
actually we believe that every human

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,860
being can be creative that being

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,020
creative is an inherent human trait so

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,880
suddenly after years of thinking that

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,410
creativity was this external factor

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,210
people started to believe that

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,490
creativity was just something that you

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,160
are was just simply a part of your

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,840
identity and that you persisted until

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,280
the 20th century when social

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,580
psychologists came on the scene and they

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,020
said okay if everyone is creative then

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,300
that means we should be able to measure

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,640
it so they started doing experiments

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,010
about you know how quickly you could

00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,020
solve problems were you a divergent

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,080
thinker all sorts of things like that

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,460
and creativity became something a skill

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,600
set that you possess something that you

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,940
had and finally today creativity has now

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,100
become a part of our job that is a unit

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,010
of economic output it is now something

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,600
that we do and the reason I mentioned

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,970
that it's something that we do and why

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,000
it's so important is because for the

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,790
first time in our economic history being

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,700
creative is something that is a skill

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,159
set that employers want in their

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,599
employees

00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,009
this is a huge shift because

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:46,429
traditionally productivity and

00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,599
creativity were considered two unrelated

00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:51,449
concepts things that they didn't really

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,219
have to intersect so when you worked in

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,899
a factory your boss didn't care if you

00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:56,309
were creative in fact they didn't want

00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,289
you to be creative they just wanted you

00:06:56,309 --> 00:07:00,330
to come in punch and punch out and do

00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:01,550
your work but now that we're in a

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,289
knowledge economy

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,499
everyone is under incredible pressure to

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:09,360
be innovative and I hear companies all

00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:11,639
the time talk about how they want their

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,099
workers to find new products new ideas

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,860
new markets new solutions and we always

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,089
say we want our workers to be innovative

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,740
what we often forget is that if you

00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:21,659
break down the definition of innovation

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,490
and why I spend so much time talking

00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:25,800
about productivity and creativity is

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,080
that innovation just simply means that

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,649
you have to be productive and creative

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,869
within a specific economic context so

00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:35,879
you can't really be innovative without

00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:37,889
being creative and you can't really be

00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,449
innovative from a from a business

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,059
perspective if it's not also a

00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,399
productive endeavor

00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:45,990
now we force these two things together a

00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,360
productivity and creativity but there's

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,419
one huge problem which is that these two

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,219
concepts are fundamentally incompatible

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:55,289
and this explains some of the tensions

00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:57,629
that we face today you see productivity

00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:00,300
as we learn from the assembly line work

00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:02,129
is based on this idea of continuous

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,649
productivity on a continuous output

00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,839
meaning you have to justify what you're

00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:09,119
doing every second that you're at work

00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:10,709
to prove that you're adding value to

00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:12,929
prove that you're being productive to

00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,819
prove that you're working and we see

00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:16,919
many of these ideologies that are

00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:19,529
embedded in high-tech systems like

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,969
timesheets and task tracking and a lot

00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:24,149
of these different technologies that we

00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,889
use in offices today the problem is that

00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:28,499
creativity is not something that you can

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,360
always continuously measure psychology

00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:32,849
and neuroscience has shown us the

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,579
creativity is a messy and disjointed

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,110
process a lot of it is intangible a lot

00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:39,180
of it happens in the background this is

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,430
why you often get these ideas your

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,500
breakthrough ideas when you are in the

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,269
shower or walking your dog or when

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,189
you're driving home or on your commute

00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,620
it's because it's not you don't always

00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:51,360
see somebody actively being creative

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,100
somebody could be solving a very

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,990
complicated coding problem as they're

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,760
lying on a couch staring at their see

00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,120
and they're still kind of working even

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,550
if you can't see it so there's this

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,589
clear and competing tension between

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,149
these two ideologies that is creating a

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,310
lot of stress you can start to see why

00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,680
now we expect employees to solve these

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,630
increasingly complicated problems to

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,640
build new technologies so we want them

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,070
to be creative but we're putting them in

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,720
an organizational culture that has

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,630
methodologies that are left over from

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,850
the Industrial Revolution and this is

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,500
the fact that many people ignore when

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,420
looking at their organizational culture

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,370
right they forget that based on the

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,899
shared history we all work for

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,000
organizations especially some of the

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,070
older companies that are productivity

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,720
centric and the reason this is so

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,580
important to think about when thinking

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,950
about how do you create spaces for

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,290
people to thrive is that you can't hire

00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,510
creative people if you don't have a

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,490
culture where that creativity can take

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,160
root and where they can be creative I

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,750
talk to organizations multinational

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,390
organizations where they tell me that

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,370
they hire incredible thinkers creative

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,380
people but they have a hard time keeping

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,690
them because you take creative thinkers

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,970
and then you force them into a system of

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,649
work that was never intended or made for

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,700
the type of work that they are expected

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:10,529
to do so something to think about there

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,270
the second thing I want to talk to you

00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:15,020
about is our biology in the ways that

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:18,720
our brains are wired right now for work

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,970
so I want you to think about the data

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,890
abundance that we are all surrounded by

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,480
on a daily basis and I think there's

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,180
nobody else other than this room that

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,950
truly understands the sheer amount of

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,020
information and data that we are

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,630
expected to consume and interact with on

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,010
a daily basis so raise your hand if just

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,550
since waking up in the morning you have

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,770
used your phone or your device to email

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,500
text message access a social network

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,180
play a game do anything like that so

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,890
obviously everyone in this room I would

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,279
expect nothing less so we are actually

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,050
creating a massive amount of information

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,329
this is a slide that shows how much

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,120
information is produced every 30 seconds

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:59,850
on the web now what I want to focus on

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,160
in terms of the expectation of how much

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,860
information were we we are meant to

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,490
consume is what this is doing to our

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,819
brains on a cognitive level so before I

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,470
even

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:12,660
finished talking about the slide there

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,609
will be almost 12,000 hours of Netflix

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,649
footage watch and almost 102 million

00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:19,350
emails that are sent and this is just

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,999
business as usual so what are these

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,389
devices and what is all this information

00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:26,429
doing to our brains well as many of you

00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:29,100
might know when your any of your devices

00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:31,350
if they ping or ding or vibrate or they

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,629
make any sort of notification at all

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,999
your brain actually releases pleasure

00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:38,669
hormones it releases dopamine it makes

00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:41,009
you feel good and what's happening

00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:43,619
because there's a never-ending flow of

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:47,279
information is we are conditioning

00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:49,499
ourselves like Pavlov's dogs to always

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,769
be seeking these micro doses of

00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:55,410
stimulation we are becoming addicted to

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:57,779
constant stimulation there was this

00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,149
research project that I that I read

00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,679
about which really made me laugh and it

00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,809
was they took the researchers took an

00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,189
individual they put them in a room they

00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:07,350
took everything else out of the room

00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:09,660
except for a table and a chair and on

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,449
the table was this little machine and if

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,959
you touched it it gave you an electric

00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:17,970
shock and researchers found out that

00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:22,549
people would rather electrocute

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:25,559
themselves than be bored for 20 minutes

00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:28,319
now you might laugh but think about this

00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:31,139
we have created a culture of constant

00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:32,850
distraction and constant distraction

00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:34,919
makes it difficult to focus to

00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,809
concentrate to get into states of flow

00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,459
to do the deep work that we need to do

00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:40,739
in order to be creative and in order to

00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,109
solve these problems now let me ask you

00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:43,859
this when was the last time that you

00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:49,019
were bored

00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:50,459
don't say now but should have prefaced

00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,839
this but you know think about the last

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,039
time other than now that you were

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,269
actually bored and you might be

00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,850
surprised to find that you can't

00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:59,039
remember we have devices in our hands

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,259
all the time we have stimulation all the

00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,579
time you're waiting for your train or

00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:04,139
your plane you're on your phone you're

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:05,189
waiting for your coffee order you're on

00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,899
your phone you're waiting for your

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:08,549
meeting to start you're on your phone

00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,229
the person that you're with that dinner

00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:11,429
gets up for two seconds to go to the

00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:14,159
washroom you're immediately on your

00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,779
phone and this is the type of cultural

00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,850
behaviors that we're building with our

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,220
devices and with our technology and it's

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,550
having an impact on our ability to be

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,399
creative

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,230
and creativity needs space and time so

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,880
how can you be innovative how can you

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,980
solve all these big problems how can you

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,170
build all these technologies if you

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,910
never give your brain the actual thing

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,920
that it needs on a biological and a

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,670
physiological level in order to help you

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
do that

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,839
and this is particularly concerning when

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,450
we see that a lot of the technology that

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,399
we are using today are built for both

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,019
addiction and urgency they're built on

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,760
engagement it's built on trying to get

00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,130
you to use these technologies as often

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,800
as possible but more than that on a

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,170
social level we've created social norms

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,750
where we expect each other to be always

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,700
available and always responsive this is

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,529
why one of my most hated features are

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,180
read receipts or those dreaded blue

00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:06,430
checkmarks that let somebody else know

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,200
that you've read their message what is

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,240
the purpose of that other than to create

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,579
social anxiety and potentially create

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,079
problems and conflicts and relationships

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:15,700
when you're like why did you leave me on

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,640
red why did it take you so long to

00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,160
respond to my message so we're creating

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,890
social norms that reinforce this idea

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,779
that we have to be constantly connected

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,279
but constant connection equals constant

00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,350
distraction which can prevent us from

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:34,630
being creative which is a key part of

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:36,970
being innovative so some of the most

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,680
innovative tools that we use can

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,180
actually get in the way of innovation

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,010
and I mention this point because again

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,930
when I talk to people when I talk to

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,850
teams they always tell me there's a new

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,500
tool a new methodology we're gonna have

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,209
a slack channel we're gonna use this new

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,950
app we're gonna track our time this way

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,810
and they think that they need new

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,940
technology in order to improve the way

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,740
that they work and while technology can

00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,690
improve the way that we work we have to

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,480
be very careful that the way that we

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,670
apply it is in a way that respects the

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,350
natural process of how our brains need

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,000
to function which means we don't need to

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,410
be constantly getting endless

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,029
notifications and endless interruptions

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:16,000
the last big piece is looking at our

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:18,699
culture and looking at how our culture

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,199
treats success what success looks like

00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:25,320
and who deserves to be successful so we

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,430
live in a culture today where we idolize

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,260
creativity we think creativity is

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,029
amazing we think it's the best thing

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,170
ever and we worship and we idolize

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,779
creative people but when you react

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,250
warship productivity and we have this

00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,779
really strange relationship between

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,410
these two concepts and I'll show you

00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,389
what I mean

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,190
for hustle flow one of the things that I

00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:46,339
did was I looked at who are some of the

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,160
people that were most often googled or

00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:50,810
most often searched for for being really

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,360
innovative and creative in their field

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,940
and then I looked at what was the fact

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,579
about them that was most often repeated

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,170
when we looked up stories about them so

00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,600
Tim Cook leading one of the most

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,610
innovative companies on the planet the

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,230
most often repeated fact that I found

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,660
about him was the fact that he sends

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,440
emails to his team at 4:30 a.m. in the

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,320
morning

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,649
Jeff Bezos worked 12 hours seven days a

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,829
week

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:18,560
Elon Musk spends a hundred hours a week

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:20,959
for the past 15 years so even though we

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,360
admire these people for their visionary

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,860
creative abilities for leading creative

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,540
companies for trying to build creative

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,399
cultures when we talk about their

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,339
success when we talk about why they're

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,160
worth admiring we often talk about how

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:36,199
hard they work and these types of

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,420
beliefs are always reinforced no matter

00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:41,300
where we go take a look at some of these

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,670
business magazines behind me so you have

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,890
Oprah a creative professional and yet

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,110
she's on a list of the you know most

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,209
productive people Pharrell a musician

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,000
who's known for his creative outputs for

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,850
his music for his art and yet we have

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,339
them on a list of most productive people

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,470
and then there's the never-ending cover

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,600
stories about getting more done getting

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,089
more done right it's always about trying

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,270
to fit in as much as you can in the day

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:11,000
and the reason why we're so obsessed

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,980
with how hard people are working is

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,839
because it's actually keys into one of

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,919
the most powerful ideologies that we

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,230
have seen in this technological

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,270
revolution which is the American Dream

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,970
and I talk about the American Dream

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,890
because even though it exists in it's

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,290
different variations the German dreamed

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,240
of British Dream the French dream etc

00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,250
the American Dream has been one of the

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,290
most powerful ideologies because it is

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,450
very much embodied in the startup boom

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,799
the tech boom the Silicon Valley culture

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,870
and that is one of the things that

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,299
people aspire and want to be like so

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,190
we've kind of absorbed it now the

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,990
American Dream very simply one that

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,670
we're all familiar with is this idea

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,310
that if you work hard

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:52,010
enough you will be successful which

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,620
sounds really simple right but it's a

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,690
little bit more complicated than that

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,580
you see the American Dream also includes

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,190
a hidden thing which I call the shadow

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,130
dream a hidden aspect to it and the

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,110
shadow dream is this if you believe that

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,340
if you work hard enough you will be

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,290
successful right if you're really

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,330
productive you'll be successful then a

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:14,300
part of you also believes that if you're

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:17,390
not successful then it must be because

00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,550
you're not working hard enough and this

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,230
is why people don't take vacation days

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,670
they don't take breaks this is why they

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,100
don't stop because if they feel like

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,780
they are inherently responsible for

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,730
their lack of success due to a lack of

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,730
effort they will do everything they can

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,380
to compensate for that now you might

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,000
think ok well this can't really be a

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,290
thing the shadow dream well let me show

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,440
you what it looks like when we look at

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,780
digital culture this is a quote by Bill

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,450
Gates that gets circulated all the time

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,210
and he says if you are born poor then

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:50,690
it's not your fault but if you die poor

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,700
than it is so again you're responsible

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,790
for your lack of success right and this

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,870
is a message that's delivered by a

00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,760
technology phenomenon and a creative

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,650
genius somebody who was known for his

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,200
rags to riches story this is a person

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,210
that embodies all of the benefits that

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,780
we think culturally are tied to success

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,130
and this is what he's telling us except

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,620
there's just one problem with this quote

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,440
which is Bill Gates never actually said

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,800
this and yet the internet insists that

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,900
he did and when I looked into this when

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,250
I clicked on these images to see what

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,320
were people talking about with this

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,800
misattributed quote do you know what I

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,590
saw hashtag 5 am club hashtag team never

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,660
sleep hashtag hustle hard hashtag never

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,540
stopped working hashtag last one in the

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,480
office these this quote which was not

00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,630
true was being used as an aspirational

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,580
quote to justify people working overtime

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,130
people doing things and working against

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,270
their own creative best interest so

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,880
what's happening is that we're creating

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,590
this cultural narrative that celebrates

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,720
overwork we're sending messages to

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,520
people that overwork is this ideal state

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,380
look at this tote bag this

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,610
innocent-looking tote bag it says you

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,730
have as many hours in the day as the

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,740
on say not as creative as Beyonce not

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,510
you can make music like Beyonce not like

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,490
you too can express yourself

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,580
artistically like Beyonce no you too can

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:14,160
be as productive as Beyonce because even

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,750
though she's a creative visionary she

00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,320
also works really hard and we also

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,790
admire her productivity so the problem

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,380
with this is that overwork kills

00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,480
creativity and this is the fundamental

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,370
root of a lot of the tensions we see at

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,350
work but these messages still get sent

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,500
to us this is an ad that was put up all

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,960
over New York from Fiverr look at the

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,120
copy for this ad it says you eat a

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,220
coffee for lunch you follow through on

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,260
your follow through sleep deprivation is

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,990
the drug of choice you might be a doer

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,270
and in doors we trust because doers are

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,770
productive doers are successful so you

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,320
know what would be really great if you

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:53,850
want to be successful to not sleep and

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,620
to skip meals look at her face would you

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,360
trust her to make the critical decision

00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,280
on your project would you trust her to

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,080
do the last quality control to check the

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,100
code before you ship that project out or

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,460
would you be like go home take a nap eat

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,380
a sandwich and come back later but these

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,880
are the messages that are packaged to us

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,610
as archetypes of success and they're

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,809
quite problematic now I wanted to spend

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,419
it but a little bit of time talking

00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:20,280
about culture because culture is an

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,290
incredibly powerful force and it can't

00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,320
be it can't be solved and it can't be

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,480
addressed simply by policies because

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,400
Netflix a very innovative company they

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,799
tried to combat this by giving people

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,780
unlimited paid vacation days as a policy

00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,520
and people didn't take it and when they

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,990
asked them why they said they weren't

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,190
afraid of what their managers would

00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,559
think they were afraid of what their

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,320
colleagues would think of them remember

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,490
productivity seen as a key to success so

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,200
if your colleagues don't think you're

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,419
being productive enough then will that

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,660
damage your their recommendations of

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:54,059
your performance and future advancements

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,250
so all of this to say that when policies

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,830
come up and technology comes up against

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,780
these deeply held belief systems then

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,570
the deeply held belief systems always

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,480
win and I think in the rush of talking

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,700
about technology we are missing these

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,410
deep forces that are influencing how we

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,510
work in influencing our ability to be

00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,890
creative so I hope I've given you some

00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,660
stuff to think about in terms of

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,060
challenging our beliefs about work I

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,770
believe that this is we need to talk

00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,480
about our history we need to talk about

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,310
the technologies that are shaping our

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,410
behaviors need to talk about our

00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:29,440
cultural beliefs around success and

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,210
self-worth and I believe that we need to

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,700
create systems and technologies that

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,800
were built for us for the type of work

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,390
that we were meant to do I think that is

00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,700
the most important challenge we're gonna

00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,560
face as we enter this new technological

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,870
boom this next level of the

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,090
technological revolution but I am sure

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:53,590
that we are all up for the challenge

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:54,100
thank you very much I want to ask you a

00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,330
quick question

00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:01,720
so we some of you may remember we had a

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:03,250
speaker near I all a couple years ago at

00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,750
our event and I when I was watching your

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,670
talk I loved it so he does anyone

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,990
remember this guy he wrote a book named

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,510
hook

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,360
yeah and hoped was how do you create

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,010
these habit-forming products for digital

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,920
kai so this is the like button for

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,750
Facebook and how you get addicted so I

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,270
don't know if you know he recently

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:25,980
released another book just this year I

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:28,540
hooked on hook so it's it's called in

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,140
distractible okay and it's sort of the

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,670
cure for being hooked on these digital

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,380
products and services so it's refreshing

00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,730
to see like people are thinking about

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,080
what we have to because I think it's

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,970
gonna stop us from doing the work that

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,830
we all want to do and that's the crazy

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,390
part I think technology can help us be

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,220
incredibly creative I think it can help

00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,070
