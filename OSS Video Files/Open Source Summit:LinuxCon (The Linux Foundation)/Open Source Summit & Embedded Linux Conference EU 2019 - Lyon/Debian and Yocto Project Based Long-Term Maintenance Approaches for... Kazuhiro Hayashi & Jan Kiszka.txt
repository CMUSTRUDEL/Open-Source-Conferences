	Debian and Yocto Project Based Long-Term Maintenance Approaches for Embedded Products - Kazuhiro Hayashi, Toshiba & Jan Kiszka, Siemens AG

In industrial products, 10+ years maintenance is required, including security fixes, reproducible builds, and continuous system updates. Selecting appropriate base systems and tools is necessary for efficient product development. Debian has been applied to industrial products because of its stability, long-term supports, and powerful tools for packages development. The CIP Project, which provides scalable and customizable base image and BSP layers, is now used in various embedded devices. The speakers introduce the two different approaches to satisfy the requirements above; Deby and ISAR. Both provide simple but effective functions to customize and maintain Debian for embedded products. This talk not only explains preferred use cases of each approach, how to apply to product development, and relation with other open source projects but also how the CIP project supports building a sustainable industrial-grade Linux distribution.
