	V4L2: A Status Update - Hans Verkuil, Cisco Systems Norway*

Since the beginning of 2018 a lot of work has been put into improving the V4L2 subsystem. The main addition was the Request API, which is required for stateless hardware codecs, and will help improve complex camera pipelines. Codecs in general saw a lot of attention and our virtual drivers (such as the new vicodec driver) are now being used in test frameworks. So it is time to present an overview of the current state of V4L2 and what can be expected from it in the future.
