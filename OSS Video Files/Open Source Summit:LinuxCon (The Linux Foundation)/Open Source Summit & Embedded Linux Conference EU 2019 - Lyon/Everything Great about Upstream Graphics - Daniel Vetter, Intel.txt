Description: 
	Everything Great about Upstream Graphics - Daniel Vetter, Intel*

This talk will cover upstream technologies, infrastructure and driver components relevant for enabling the graphics side of an SoC: Improvements in zero-copy buffer sharing across drivers, better infrastructure for sharing driver components and some SoC specific hardware features like writeback support, self refresh panels, and more. The talk will also cover current development and what the near future will bring.

Upstream graphics has been a solid foundation on the desktop for years. This talk will show that the dream of enabling upstream first, and then shipping on Android, CrOS, genivi, ... or any other custom linux based solution can now also be achieved for SoCs and tiny embedded systems.
