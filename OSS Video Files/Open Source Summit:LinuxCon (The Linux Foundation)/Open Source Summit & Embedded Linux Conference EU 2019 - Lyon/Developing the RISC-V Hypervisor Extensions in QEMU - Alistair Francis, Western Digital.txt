Description: 
	Developing the RISC-V Hypervisor Extensions in QEMU - Alistair Francis, Western Digital

In this presentation Alistair will talk about the work he and his colleagues did to add the RISC-V Hypervisor Extension support to QEMU. This allows everyone to use QEMU as a development platform for porting Hypervisors to RISC-V.

He will discuss how the RISC-V Hypervisor extension works and how it is different to other common architectures Hypervisor support. He will also talk about how the extension was implemented in QEMU and problems that were identified with the draft specification in the process. Finally he will conclude with the current upstream status and any pending work related to both QEMU and the RISC-V Hypervisor specification in general, he will also cover Hypervisor project porting status.
