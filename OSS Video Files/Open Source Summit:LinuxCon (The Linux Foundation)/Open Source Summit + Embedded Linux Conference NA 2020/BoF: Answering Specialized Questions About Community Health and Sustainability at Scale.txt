so welcome to this birds of a feather

00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,799
session focused on people who have what

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,929
I call specialized questions that you

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,809
want to ask about community health and

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,299
sustainability at scale and so I'd like

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:19,020
to start with just a brief discussion of

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,240
what kinds of things have occurred at

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,460
scale and what kinds of projects or

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,670
groups of repositories that we have

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,130
looked at at scale so what first of all

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,029
what do I mean by at scale I'm

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,420
interested

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,910
and so in when we sit when I say at

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,450
scale we're usually I'm in the thousands

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:43,860
of repositories usually 2,000 or more as

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,070
many as 25,000 repositories that were

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,719
trying to create signals for and

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,379
understand at any one time and usually

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,030
these are open source program offices

00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:56,730
inside of organizations that have these

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,899
kinds of questions and this diversity of

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,910
projects and also companies that are

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,830
part of the open source community who

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,549
manage thousands of projects at a time

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,229
and I'd like to open a chat discussion

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,860
since that's how you're able to

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,619
participate and just ask when I so we

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,750
say a scale and when when we talk when

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,570
you decided to participate in this birds

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,390
of a feather session on health and

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:32,939
sustainability at scale what what does

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:39,450
at scale mean to you and I believe you

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:44,990
can use your chat to get to sort of

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,990
typing in what xk l' means to you

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:07,110
okay attendees apparently need to raise

00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,110
your hands first in order to be called

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,700
so for those of you who just are joining

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,610
us this is of birds of a feather session

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,870
on health and sustainability at scale I

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,569
introduced the topic as large-scale

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,880
organizations that either use in a

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:51,030
number of open-source projects and the

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,620
thousands and want to understand ongoing

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,959
health and sustainability of those

00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,090
dependencies at scale and/or open-source

00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,670
software companies that look at

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,190
thousands to tens of thousands of

00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,049
projects that they have concerned you

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,680
know an interest in and want to

00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:13,049
understand at scale and I'm throwing out

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,400
a question thinking of a birds of a

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,010
feather session being a little bit more

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,170
conversational my understanding is you

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,380
have to raise your hand to ask a

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,950
question in the chat but I'm interested

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,200
in what you think a health and

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,590
sustainability at scale is what is it to

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,620
you looking looking to the participants

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,160
to ask a question you know sort of state

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,329
to you what if what what is it what does

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,329
that scale mean to you

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,200
so I don't know what it means that no

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:26,290
one's raising their hand in a birds of a

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:32,800
feather session let me try to think

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:34,960
about can is everybody able get somebody

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,210
raise their hand just to make sure that

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,210
that part of is working

00:04:50,620 --> 00:05:18,060
okay all right all right and so I've got

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:21,190
a couple of raise their hand so I I

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:29,800
don't seem to have the power to do

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:32,370
anything with the hand raised it seems

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:40,180
that the raised hand function requires

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:41,980
camera and mic not text okay so you can

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,490
ask you could you can answer my question

00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:49,300
via text without raising your hand but

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:53,770
you can ask you can speak

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:57,130
I think if okay

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,950
and Dylan I am not hearing you

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,620
um that would probably be because I was

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,720
not talking oh okay

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,000
great you know thank you for helping to

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:13,330
sort out this process well I guess since

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,340
I'm on the spot as a co-founder of a

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:20,410
small start-up at scale to us means

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:25,630
something with a business substantially

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:27,820
more established and and with access to

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,360
much larger resources than what my

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:35,190
co-founder Vinnie and I currently have

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,870
it's a little bit I guess ephemeral a

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,810
concept for someone that's still tended

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,030
as small and and growing as we are I

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,520
guess something that we're still

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:49,180
interested in learning more about hence

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,770
why we were on the call yeah yeah so

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:58,180
that's a so there are others who are in

00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:00,250
similar positions that that have a sort

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,350
of interest in understanding what it

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:10,280
looks like to be at scale

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:20,680
and see and then I have another another

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:24,790
person who accepted so all right so

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:29,030
Shriram I think are you the other person

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:31,730
having a hand raised I think okay yeah

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,700
can you hear me I can you now I think I

00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,620
think what's happening is the person

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,290
who's the host is the person who can

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,570
give you the control not me right

00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,730
Meghan's helping us out so sorry

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:49,370
all right no problem I'm glad we can

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:52,270
test it so do you have a mean is your is

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,490
your interest in or is your interest or

00:07:52,270 --> 00:08:01,120
definition of what that scale means it's

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,120
different from from what Dylan said uh

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:08,450
sorry I missed part of that so I so I

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:13,310
didn't get ca hear everything Dylan said

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:15,980
my apologies but I am interested in that

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,980
kind of scale ability for metrics I am I

00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:22,070
am involved in the chaos project we do

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:25,190
at apps ecosystem it's a work for

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,680
changing to name but it's very much

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:31,010
linked to scalable onboarding and

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:36,430
various other projects we're doing not

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:40,640
at itv knew but at the genome project so

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:43,969
so yeah this this is this is something

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:51,290
interesting to me yeah so so that gets

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:55,790
to sort of the question of what what

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,220
chaos is and erm you're you're clearly

00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,370
familiar with it you know a project that

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:07,670
provides both definitions of health and

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:11,360
sustainability metrics as well as tools

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,940
that let communities look at the health

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,160
and sustainability by gathering and

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,790
analyzing a bunch of data so

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,250
the main area where the metrics are

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:27,230
developed I've just put in chat and our

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:32,089
general community site is just without

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:35,959
the slash metrics trailer and so what

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:38,600
Kaos does these two things one is sort

00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,550
of try to help define provide standard

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,310
definitions or reach consensus in a

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,980
large group of industry participants

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,420
about what is what does it mean to how

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,910
do we count commits how do we count

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,550
newcomers what are the things that are

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,430
parameters newcomers is a really good

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,560
example of a newcomer or what we call it

00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,660
what I call stickiness you know okay you

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,790
get it so many newcomers a month how

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,209
many of them make a second contribution

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:07,160
or a fifth contribution on a periodic

00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,379
basis and that those kinds of metrics

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,199
can help people who are running

00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:14,480
large-scale communities or startup open

00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:16,699
source communities determine if the new

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,610
project that they have is the scaling

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:23,300
wall and also share practices that

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:27,769
they've had for scaling the projects as

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,750
well what what we do with chaos and the

00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,670
tools that we have on chaos and the tool

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:35,689
I work most closely with is called augur

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:38,630
is we gather in the case of OGG or we

00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:40,310
gather a hundred well to I guess twenty

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,810
five thousand is the most we've gathered

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,579
in a single database of repositories

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:49,069
with lots of different information where

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:52,100
we can look at relative newcomer

00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:55,220
participation newcomer stickiness we can

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,779
also look at fact some of the metrics

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,089
that we've defined around elephant

00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:01,579
factor but we have a license scanner

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,699
that that lets you know what licensing

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:06,620
risk is sometimes it's scale

00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:11,449
understanding licensing is really really

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:14,870
important and and so when you have a

00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:17,269
large scale enterprise or for example if

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,189
you're a startup firm yet a large number

00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,920
of open source projects and you want to

00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:24,050
understand the relative health one way

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,149
to do it is to just sort of get a survey

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,939
of the landscape and some of the basic

00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:29,540
metrics and statistics and another way

00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,269
to approach

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,560
is to take this giant collection of data

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:44,839
that auger lets you create in a database

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:47,480
and actually put em is typing the link

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,709
to auger in there and actually starting

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,009
to use some of the jupiter notebooks

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:55,910
that were distributing to analyze things

00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:58,880
like pull request stickiness you can

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,009
also do competitive intelligence so if

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,930
you have a bunch of projects you know

00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:07,519
you're competing against that is another

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:11,990
way that people define scale in the case

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:17,509
of sharam who am i sayin your name

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:20,120
correctly sure oh yeah sorry

00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:21,980
the last bit there guy from below is the

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,630
last indication my shape them I'm not

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,079
saying your name correctly can you hear

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,870
me already

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,660
oh yeah right yeah yeah it's just that

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:33,319
little bit you are perfectly clear up

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,899
until then so yes my name is yeah is

00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,329
Shriram pronounced per Shriram or Sri

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:41,839
I'm mostly known as Sri in the open

00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:44,750
source world so yeah okay

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:49,519
oh yes yes Celine pointed out that I

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:52,519
mistyped my I actually mistake the chaos

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,089
group an hour on the internet there so

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,160
thank you very much saline so so the

00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,589
group that she rom is working with is

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,889
looking at kind of a I would call it an

00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:07,910
orthogonal view of metrics definitions

00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:11,180
and it really is kind of organically an

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:14,029
at scale problem because in in the case

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,470
of the gnome community community you

00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,810
have under how many different

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:23,630
applications for that for that desktop

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:28,100
ah we have a large number and the

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:30,290
there's part I would say like I'm gonna

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,970
put on a guess here but there's nine

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:37,510
they're part of the release of genome by

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,370
hundreds of others right there right

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,830
yeah and and I

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,610
imagine that in the case so in the case

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:49,420
of this sort of orthogonal specialized

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:51,540
desktop app system it's really hard to

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,550
keep track of even hundreds of different

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,800
repositories that are material to the

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,880
utility or usefulness of that ecosystem

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,700
right right right

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,900
I will also want to add that it's not

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,620
just a gnome

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:12,010
but essentially organizations yeah it's

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:15,820
basically organizations that are public

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:19,270
facing projects like desktop projects

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:21,880
that are very complex because we're

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:26,650
they're just basically platforms of

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,510
various types and and so this is this

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,540
effort is sort of because it's different

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:35,260
from corporate sponsored projects but we

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:37,600
have similar problems but we had this

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:42,970
additional thing where we deal with the

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:47,650
public a lot more closely you know the

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:51,730
consumer is is using the tools right

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:57,330
exactly exactly and so how we interact

00:14:51,730 --> 00:15:02,700
with that public can be somewhat complex

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:05,380
because it's not a it's not an arrow I

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,200
don't want I want to say cross-section

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,620
right it's it's basically the Linux

00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:16,779
enthusiasts which poses an incredible

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:19,320
amount of challenges for us yeah yeah so

00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,880
it's a it's it's a public facing

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,540
environment of highly technical people

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,330
who are not necessarily contributors and

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,560
so part of the responsiveness needs the

00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:33,760
that specialized part of the Cask

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,380
community has is to understand that

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,450
there's some alignment between the

00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:44,520
public satisfaction or dissatisfaction

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:47,350
and the developer bandwidth or

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,780
commitment or ongoing contributions to a

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,650
particular part of that ecosystem yes

00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,770
exactly exactly

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:59,360
and it's not just that but quantifying

00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:01,640
those interactions through get a good

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:07,670
lab you know specifically since that's

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:10,370
that's been what our our communities

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:14,650
have been using but we do a lot of

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:17,750
quantitative things even even parts of

00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:19,160
abusive abuse like the abusive uses of

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:25,000
emojis right all right some of the

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:28,190
things that we can actually quantify so

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,290
we can quantify both negative

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,570
interactions and positive interactions

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:37,279
emojis or some of these other other

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:39,080
things and it's and it this is for us of

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,120
ways that these are the things that are

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,610
different that I feel that we have in

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,610
our more controlled environments is that

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:49,130
we don't have control over people with a

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:54,260
lot of them are mainly anonymous right

00:16:49,130 --> 00:17:02,690
so it gives it some freedom to free

00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:05,569
speech oh that's that's so that's that's

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:09,319
a very different you know I was

00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:11,809
listening to Dylan earlier his interest

00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,510
is there the interest that his the firm

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:17,750
that that they're at has is in

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,449
understanding you know what does scale

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,760
look like and how would they help people

00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:26,059
understand its health and sustainability

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,439
at scale with in the in your case I

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,920
think I think what I hear is that

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,280
there's this public pressure piece of it

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:38,420
so scale to you means a much sort of

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,640
help desk type of input can you manage

00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,920
and then what are some metrics that you

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,630
can put around that are you lose your

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:49,040
group does your subgroup looking at sort

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,390
of those kinds of metrics or were the

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,210
kinds of metrics that are really

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,070
critical for something where there's a

00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,010
lot of public input which is really

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,110
distinct from the kinds of things that

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,780
most open-source projects are attending

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,740
to like contributors and commits and

00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:09,240
things like that right

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:13,800
I well at the moment we're still putting

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:16,110
together these metrics still in the very

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,230
beginning stages but we're essentially

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,270
breaking down the problem into what are

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,800
the information we're looking for based

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:28,200
more moles and various other things so

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,520
if you give me a moment I at some time

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,340
here I can try to put something together

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:41,490
based on the work we've done all right I

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:44,790
can't I can't I guess I didn't prep

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:53,970
myself for that I don't know what I

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:59,340
expected you to so that makes that makes

00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:03,390
perfect sense other are there other

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:06,480
folks who have different interests and

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:11,309
what scalability is I see some folks

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,950
from Ubuntu here I see a few other

00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:17,510
academics like myself in the room

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:20,100
are there other other kinds of sort of

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,080
dimensions of scalability that that

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:28,440
folks may want to raise their hand and

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:30,380
share with us as a is a just examples of

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,760
what what brings your interest here

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,130
begin with my idea of being like birds

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,260
of a feather the more we share about our

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,860
particular challenges that we're facing

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:44,330
I think the more interesting the

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,330
discussion might be

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:25,250
okay hearing hearing them I do have a

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:27,530
chat question so Celine is really

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,980
interested if you look to your chat and

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:35,960
I'm just sort of providing mean sort of

00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:39,320
sports commentator where you look

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,530
because it's not always clear in the

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:48,260
system so interesting and the SCMS

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:50,030
Dillons working on but by us so being

00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:53,470
able to measure community sentiment

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:56,990
probably will be huge when it's working

00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:06,940
SCMS i don't know it s CMS is actually

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:09,290
an acronym for when we have Dylan raises

00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,930
Dylan when you raise your hand again and

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:17,420
see if Megan can give you a little bit

00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:20,210
more of the floor and then that way we

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,990
can first of all I don't know it s CMS

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:28,960
is all right lost track of that acronym

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:32,740
which is so yeah

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:37,010
venya Logan and I are in the process of

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:39,440
introducing a new metric system in with

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,620
the most recent chaos a community

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,840
metrics launched here and what we went

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,670
ahead and designed is the social

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,410
currency metric system that is

00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:53,990
essentially a way to quantify

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:56,300
qualitative data no that's that's

00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:00,440
essentially what what that is we are in

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:02,260
the process of working with one of the V

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,170
students going through the Google

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:09,650
summary coding program here on that

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:13,250
chaos sponsored and in the process of

00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:19,480
really I guess spinning things up and

00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:23,859
our our big our big question is we have

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,309
this implementation that is

00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:29,109
what's essentially a Minimum Viable

00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:37,389
Product how do we take you know that

00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:40,119
that MVP and continue to spin up the the

00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:42,249
number of clients essentially that we

00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:48,429
can on board that we can serve and that

00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:50,109
we can support as that comes out of

00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:52,419
production and everything in the way

00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:55,299
that we've kind of the conclusion that

00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:58,799
we've come to is a sort of passive

00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:02,919
training program where essentially we do

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,229
rounds of videos with uh that we would

00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:13,049
provide for free our big thing with the

00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:15,700
SEMS is basically being a free supported

00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:20,139
platform for anyone that's interested in

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:22,570
the concept with more intensive lessons

00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:25,929
kind of locked behind that that paywall

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:30,279
that being less of training more of like

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:31,830
a consultation sort of thing with you

00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,840
know more in-depth trainings available

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:37,899
to those that choose to go that route

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,940
and so that's kind of how part of how

00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:45,489
we're trying to solve this question of

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:48,330
scalability is allowing those that kind

00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:51,039
of want to DIY this whole thing to

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,570
purchase basically lessons that will

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,549
teach us how to do them if they're not

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,879
getting what they want from the free

00:23:54,549 --> 00:24:00,549
ones and just trying to be as

00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:03,940
transparent in how we actually implement

00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:06,070
this process as possible so that's kind

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,869
of what the social currency metric

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,479
system is and how we're kind of

00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:14,470
envisioning scalability at this point in

00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:17,470
time yeah so for those of you not

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:21,629
familiar with chaos there from UTS is a

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:23,830
new thing the there's really two

00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:28,119
dimensions of scale that are being

00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:31,929
talked about Dylan is talking about the

00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:33,249
social currency metric and when so the

00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:35,470
currency metric system is actually a

00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:36,550
very different way of thinking about

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:42,190
scale

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:45,250
then then what what some of the other

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,560
folks like sri rama was was talking

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,780
about where he has hundreds of projects

00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,300
that he needs to kind of keep track of

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,330
because there's high demand that's one

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,570
sort of category of scale the social

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,570
currency metric system is a way of it's

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:05,470
a very very different than really every

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:07,990
other chaos metric in so far as most of

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,210
the chaos metrics work to define a

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,880
discrete kind of thing like issue

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,220
comments and provide parameters that can

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,420
be used to interpret those issue

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,800
comments so that any tool that

00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,740
implements the chaos metrics will give

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,380
you consistent answers in parameters and

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:30,250
it becomes kind of tool agnostic in a

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:33,910
very open source way the social currency

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:38,350
metric system in contrast is a very

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:42,700
substantial kind of a metric that takes

00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:44,700
a new account I would say it Dylan

00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,870
correct me if you think this is a to

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,960
elaborate I would say probably

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,990
constitutes 20 the weighting and

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,380
aggregation of twenty to twenty five

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:59,590
distinct discrete metrics into a score

00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,320
of sorts to help understand the level of

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,330
influence the different from the level

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:11,800
of social currency that individuals in a

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:13,270
particular ecosystem might have sorry I

00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:18,280
started talking and forgot that I had

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:22,360
muted myself mom yeah no that's we we do

00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:26,250
have these these five main metrics that

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,840
we look at that we kind of have a 201

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,870
implementation that that we were in the

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,870
process of drawing up that breaks these

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:37,420
down a little bit more but some

00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:40,320
background on the SCMS is it's a result

00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,730
of I am by trade and anthropologists

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,680
venía by trade is a communication

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,020
specialist and an anthropology student

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,690
as well there and so we're kind of

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,940
coming at this from a rather

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,550
different perspective both in terms of

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,890
scalability and in terms of what the

00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:02,350
actual purpose of these metrics are then

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,700
then a lot of Chaos's the other metrics

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:07,990
that they support and that they've

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:10,360
helped to foster we we look at the our

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:14,620
five metrics first offer transparency

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:18,160
you kill any consistency merit and Trust

00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,960
and these seem like sentiments that

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,110
would be more or less impossible to

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,570
analyze and they're definitely fairly

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:28,150
difficult to do so but by taking a look

00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:31,870
at qualitative sources from channels

00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:33,880
such as Facebook github comments support

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,730
emails and in tickets and everything

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:41,230
like that you can get a bit better an

00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:43,420
idea of how people think feel and are

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,690
speaking about the organization that

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:50,170
you're attached to and that's it

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:54,730
definitely is a bit more upfront a

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:59,230
little yeah I guess diagnostic if you if

00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:00,790
you will about the the organ is the

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:09,910
people that are working with the

00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:12,460
organizations that you're attached to so

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:15,100
your is it trying to so what's the

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:19,120
ultimate goal would you say of that that

00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:23,560
perspective on scalability so the

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,330
ultimate goal is our our goal at the

00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,210
start of this is to make the internet a

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:32,950
better place which is fairly ambitious

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:35,850
um but it takes someone with you know

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:43,840
just crazy enough to think that they can

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:46,390
potentially change things around to make

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,620
things to try and and hit that ambition

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,110
that's kind of why we're all sitting

00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:54,820
here today with the various foundations

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:56,770
that have coalesced into this very you

00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,310
know comprehensive organization and

00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:03,440
subsidiaries but what our eventual end

00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:06,730
goal is is to give business

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:11,029
and organizations ways to quantify how

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:13,580
they can be better serving the

00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:15,710
organization's surrounding their brand

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:20,019
and that's kind of the end goal here and

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:24,100
what scalability for us looks like is

00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:28,159
essentially being able to take on more

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:30,200
organizations and while ideally we would

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,379
like to give everyone you know

00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,990
one-on-one attention and and all of that

00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:39,679
and that might be kind of a scalability

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:45,320
in terms of improving from just venya

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:47,330
and myself were that's kind of still

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,659
part of what we're trying to ask

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:53,960
ourselves is what it does this is a

00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:58,429
scaling of our company or our technology

00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,399
both we're still not had a clearer

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:04,570
answer than a shrug of the shoulders for

00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:07,639
you but we're still at the point where

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:12,019
we've been very pedal-to-the-metal with

00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:15,740
getting everything set up that we don't

00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:18,740
have as good a answer for you there as

00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,049
well so I'm just going to share with

00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,000
people so scalability from the

00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:27,379
perspective of this social currency

00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,690
metric system is really I think kind of

00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:31,370
a horizontal scalability problem where

00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,629
there's a lot of different things and

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:39,559
I'm just sharing the proposed metric

00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:42,970
here so people get an idea and I also

00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:54,980
share it in the chat window

00:30:42,970 --> 00:31:00,470
oops we'll see go back here go back here

00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:02,870
to the chat window and that's that's an

00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:08,029
act that's the actual currently proposed

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:10,309
social currency system and you can see

00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:14,149
it it's just there's a lot of different

00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:17,380
data gathered here it's a fairly complex

00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:21,890
concept would you agree Dylan

00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:25,850
it's definitely very different I would

00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:29,390
it's something that's seen on academic

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:34,460
use for especially in the field that

00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:38,780
Veni and I met in anthropology for 4050

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:40,580
years but it's definitely a new form of

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,490
data analysis for kind of more

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,500
privatized organizations which

00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,660
thankfully means that it's very

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,300
different that doesn't necessarily mean

00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:55,630
it's unapproachable for those that don't

00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:58,880
have a background right right and and so

00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:02,360
but I and I I think that it's very well

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,480
articulated here I think when it comes

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,990
to implementation it's more complex for

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,810
example than when you think about scale

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,670
scalability one of the first metrics the

00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,860
activity metrics that we've all looked

00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:20,570
at or many people have looked at

00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:23,270
historically might be something like

00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:26,000
code changes which is a very fundamental

00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:29,000
metric that we did a lot of work at the

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,930
very beginning to define with some

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,530
clarity in the evolution working group

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:40,630
and it's it's a very straightforward

00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:43,670
definition and lasts about a page and

00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:46,130
really is just about this this

00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:49,100
fundamental idea of volume of coding

00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:51,380
activity and I think when I contrast it

00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,450
to what I would call a metric that's

00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,810
trying to scale across a number of

00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:00,680
things and aggregate in weight and

00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:02,900
measure them collectively as this

00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,500
concept of social currency do you agree

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:10,730
with that Dylan that that's what it's

00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,710
trying to do I had a little bit of a

00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,780
disruption in connection there part of

00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,190
the way through it but it sounded from

00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,980
everything that I caught it sounded

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:22,420
pretty accurate I'm sorry so yeah it's a

00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:26,060
no problem so it's a multi-dimensional

00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:31,000
perspective as opposed to a discrete

00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:34,130
metric it is a it's talking about

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,140
collecting analyzing communication

00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:39,950
traces which broadly construed could be

00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:42,290
just about every other metric that as a

00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,390
communication trade so commits may not

00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:46,910
be considered a communication trace for

00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,830
example but an issue or a comment or a

00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:52,180
comment on a pull request or a comment

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:56,060
on an issue are all types of

00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,740
communication traces and measuring all

00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:05,450
of these things could in other

00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:09,260
themselves be a a metric so each of

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:11,690
these could be in the historical work of

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,520
chaos over the last few plus years each

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,280
of those individual things that are part

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,800
of workgroup the social currency metric

00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,290
system is just like a discrete metric I

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,909
suppose I would say and I'll stop

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,320
sharing my screen for a minute I've

00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:29,300
shared the links if you want to browse

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:32,629
around with with that in mind then yeah

00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,340
and when I think about scalability from

00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,169
the person so there's there's really two

00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:39,710
perspectives on scalability that we've

00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:44,659
heard about so far one is a complex

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:46,490
metric like social currency doing with

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:52,370
the objective of social currency again

00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:55,250
is to what what level is it is it trying

00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:57,290
to understand like where does it help

00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,180
understand where does it help explain or

00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:01,910
define the health and sustainability of

00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:04,360
an online community it's clearly what

00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:09,440
I'd call a scaled metric it's extremely

00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:13,010
got a lot of stuff in it but but what

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,560
does it do to just tell us something

00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,900
about health and sustainability this I'm

00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,050
not wait to put you on the spot just

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,780
trying to get a little bit of a

00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:26,780
discussion going around that not not a

00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,670
problem it's one of those things where

00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,590
the end goal what it's what it's

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,680
supposed to do here is its supposed to

00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:36,170
be included in like marketing

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,460
conversations and such are conversations

00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:42,730
about um interesting trends that are

00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,450
being seen in the qualitative data

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,329
surrounding your

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:50,119
or company on essentially you know say

00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:53,240
every Friday or bi-weekly monthly

00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,290
whatever your your organization has a

00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,250
meeting where they talk about

00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:00,410
interesting trends that that have been

00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,390
seen in you know someone's on

00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,589
interesting facebook thread or a

00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,849
question that really sparked some good

00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:11,240
conversation and everything our goal is

00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:14,660
to capture the more meaningful

00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:19,250
conversations that people are having and

00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:22,000
to narrow in on the useful

00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:26,180
we call it sentiment but the useful

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,420
trends within those those conversations

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:33,050
in order to pull out what exactly you're

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:35,290
doing well as an organization what you

00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,820
as an organization could be doing better

00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:42,440
generally what people think and feel

00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:44,810
about what you do which is again a

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,339
pretty ambitious goal and something

00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,260
that's that's going to be fairly

00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:50,660
difficult to implement at first if

00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,369
you've never done something something

00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,750
like this it's going to be difficult to

00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:56,720
kind of you know wrap your head around

00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:00,800
and everything but that's at the end of

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,589
the day what it's supposed to do is give

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,329
you an idea about the sentiment of those

00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:12,500
that are participating in these branded

00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:16,700
communities um the Shriya yeah I saw

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:20,060
yeah I see the Shriya and celine asked a

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:23,390
few really interesting questions that

00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:26,900
folks can see and i'm wondering if

00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:30,260
either of them wanna elaborate or if we

00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,359
should provide an opportunity we have

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:36,619
metrics for inclusive language watching

00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:39,619
for master and blacklist etc and this is

00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:44,270
a question by Tim of the octo project at

00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:47,020
the Intel one of the things that the

00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:50,569
Chaos project is doing is a badging

00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:54,109
product that's a badging project for all

00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:55,430
of I'm just going to decide we'll come

00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:57,760
back to the other thing but this is an

00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,010
important question diverse

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,990
inclusion and using inclusive language

00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,370
like for example yet have just announced

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:08,310
they're going to get rid of the word

00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:11,440
master in in the names of repository

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:13,120
repositories and so diversity inclusion

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,000
badging is a project that's part of

00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:19,020
chaos supported in part by the sloan

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,760
foundation in mozilla where the

00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:28,170
diversity and inclusion working group

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:36,580
has defined a set of characteristics

00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:39,060
that i can't remember the exact repo for

00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:42,060
that but they've just defined a set of

00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:45,220
event based and participation based

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:48,250
kinds of metrics and and the diversity

00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:51,930
inclusion metrics are really distinct

00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:54,240
from the metrics that exists in other

00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,350
domain other metric working groups

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,950
because they're difficult to measure

00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:01,900
from electronic trace data and the

00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,900
badging program is intended to follow

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,720
the model of the open source the Journal

00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:12,940
of open source software where there's

00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:15,580
peer review on every single awarding of

00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,950
a badge so in some cases in a lot of

00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:22,270
cases you can get a badge put onto your

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:24,850
project simply by asking you know

00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:27,160
filling out a questionnaire or or making

00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,660
sure that certain files exist in the

00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,450
case of the badging program we're

00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,280
putting together for diversity inclusion

00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:36,970
there'll be those questionnaires but

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,370
they'll also be a peer review of the

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,230
application for the badge but other

00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:44,380
members of the community and the badge

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:46,390
will have a sort of a lifetime that I

00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,620
don't think has been fully determined

00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:51,100
yet somewhere between one and three

00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:53,130
years so that the use of inclusive life

00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,840
I mean use of inclusive language

00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,530
watching for words like master and

00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,350
blacklist

00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:01,060
are certainly part of the discussion in

00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,420
the diversity inclusion working group

00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:07,720
and I encourage you to look into that

00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:10,430
working group and ask about the badging

00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:16,880
program there

00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:19,220
now jumping jumping back to the some of

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,529
the concerns so communities suffer from

00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,240
tribalism at least I would in the linux

00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:25,250
enthusiast space without completely

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,900
understanding everything I've read how

00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,760
do I deal with weaponized campaigns

00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,700
against a project so that choice they

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,890
want is more trusted and then also

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,160
wondering about tribalism and measuring

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:40,609
that are there tools for visualizing

00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:43,849
networks within a community clashes can

00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:48,529
be easy to see in some visualizations so

00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:50,960
I'd like to a lot of so from the birds

00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:53,869
of a feather perspective I would invite

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,839
XI ROM or Selene to talk a little bit

00:40:53,869 --> 00:41:00,710
more about those questions I am able to

00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:03,440
talk about them for a while if you like

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,750
but I think we have about 10 minutes

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,589
left in this in this session so I'd like

00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:12,289
to have either schirra mursaleen have an

00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:18,799
opportunity to perhaps elaborate just a

00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:21,829
little further on what you mean and if

00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:23,650
you don't want to it's ok I'm just gonna

00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:31,819
give you a second to raise your hand and

00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:39,910
get call them yes uh Henry is okay she

00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:43,430
wrong okay so the desktop space is not

00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:46,849
exactly logical in terms of how they

00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:49,279
support support it's like one would

00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:52,490
prefer one or the other but there are

00:41:49,279 --> 00:41:55,460
people out there who are looking for

00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:57,230
weakness and will exploit anything to

00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,140
show that yeah you're they got the look

00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:07,099
of surprise on your face

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:10,910
I live in any world of good intention so

00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:14,960
we're I so what I do engagement I'm look

00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:19,069
I'm usually in forums or like reddit or

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,710
like on on Linux or if I'm on over

00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,490
moderating our /r kinome that since I

00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,380
represent

00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:27,289
you know I'm a Katy representative here

00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:30,339
but but they will they will probably

00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:34,460
about to say that similar similar

00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:43,930
experience or in Twitter there are

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:43,930
forces always looking to to somehow I

00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:52,099
hear good word finis but it but they're

00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,829
looking to knock us off right because

00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:57,440
we're we're generally these for you know

00:42:54,829 --> 00:43:01,339
we're generally the most install the

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,930
default choice and so there there are a

00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:05,779
lot of tribals that the sort of

00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,579
tribalism comes in is when there's

00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:10,940
something wrong right

00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:13,940
they will augment that wrongness to be

00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:18,170
able to to say this is not the right

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:21,650
project they're trying to influence what

00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:25,369
should be the default because they did

00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:27,770
because the project changes is changing

00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,990
things right and changing culture or

00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,970
things like that whether we put say

00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:35,900
something about black lives matter that

00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:39,920
was four days of dealing with wait

00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:42,200
incredible amounts of negativity the

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,480
sense of it so the sense of the project

00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:49,010
I mean I just want to understand the the

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:52,819
the project itself is in those cases

00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:55,700
where the project takes a sort of view

00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:58,010
toward diversity and inclusion exactly

00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:02,950
that are these are the moments where

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:06,549
people seek to weaponize that that

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:08,990
perspective and actually reduce the

00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:11,210
shouldn't try to subvert that project or

00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:14,720
try to replace it with a competing one

00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:18,079
but it's a yeah you view that as an

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:20,270
opportunistic kind of attack it is an

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:25,539
opportunity kind of attack and it's not

00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:29,829
related to just you know our stance on

00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:34,010
diversity it could be simple as a

00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:35,930
perception and that money was squandered

00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:38,720
by you

00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:41,570
was financial day it doesn't matter if

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,780
something can be used it can be

00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:47,330
politicized so there's a lot of policies

00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:50,390
ation that happens out in the space

00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:53,240
because what is the forum or these this

00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:56,480
politicize politicization takes place in

00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,620
America's echoing your sentiments about

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,140
toxicity and I think we could all have a

00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:05,420
beer together about that but where where

00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,110
are you deepest actually where does it

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,370
happen

00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:13,310
where does it happen it happens you see

00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:17,480
on social media of some sort I see it a

00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:19,760
lot on reddit there's no rhyme or reason

00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,790
because I mean yes read it is a very

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,640
toxic place but it's also a place that

00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:27,500
we've actually we looked at our numbers

00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,120
and we've been increasing you know

00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,300
they're like are at least in our own

00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:36,860
forums more than tripled our subscribers

00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:43,810
so but that and Twitter I can't make a

00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:47,870
post by any anything related to to

00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:51,830
diversity without having to deal with

00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:56,570
multiple days of issues with comments

00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:59,300
and toxicity and and and just to bring

00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:03,200
it back when when you're when you're

00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:07,880
metrics is about how much our audience

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:10,520
trust us then is your byline in socially

00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:15,830
constructed online I start thinking oh

00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:18,020
no because I don't know I because there

00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:20,740
are so many loud voices there mommy not

00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:26,120
there minorities but they know how to

00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:29,350
how to you know there's an opportunity

00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:32,690
to manipulate and if there's not it will

00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:35,540
so I'm just gonna we have if I

00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:39,140
understand correctly three minutes left

00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:42,740
I would like anyone that has a specific

00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:46,780
link that they're willing to share where

00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:49,290
toxicity takes place in their ecosystem

00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,080
or an ecosystem they're aware

00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:54,330
that you don't have to call your own out

00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:58,140
I think the caste community we have not

00:46:54,330 --> 00:47:01,530
discussed this issue substantively as as

00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:06,360
an obstacle to participation so this

00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:10,650
kind of tribal aggression behavior isn't

00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:13,230
something that frankly we've looked at

00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,480
at all earlier in my own career looking

00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:17,640
at open source I did a lot of analysis

00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,640
of networks to under network analysis

00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:24,750
and weighting of networks based on

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:27,270
communicate both work and talk and in

00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:30,990
that in that work certainly looking at

00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:35,460
f5 or really call extra pressure is

00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:38,880
really contributors and we can also be

00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:41,870
feels like maybe you should turn off

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,430
your boss yeah there you go

00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:45,930
so there's a lot of Network analytic

00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,940
techniques that we can use that I've

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:51,330
used in the past to identify types of

00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:54,150
leadership types of participation based

00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:57,900
on the the controlled world as well how

00:47:54,150 --> 00:48:00,900
people do things in an open source I'm

00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:03,120
really interested in like I heard reddit

00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,210
I would love to know about and I heard

00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,330
Twitter I'd love to know about

00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:10,410
subreddits

00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:12,330
or Twitter's or Twitter hashtags or

00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:16,020
Twitter accounts where these this kind

00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:19,410
of toxic tribalism takes place because I

00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:21,330
think that combined with analysis of the

00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,250
networks which we have one google Summer

00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:28,160
of Code student focused on this summer

00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:31,170
could be really helpful for scaling

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,430
questions it sounds like scaling is in

00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:40,190
this case the once you've scaled then

00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:40,190
and you have a voice and credibility

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:49,680
people people have people have a desire

00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:52,380
you know you become a point of attention

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,560
and when you take a stand on a something

00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:59,610
of a social concern that can cause you

00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:01,320
problems it looks like there is a keep

00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,819
the conversation going please visit the

00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:06,479
number to track community

00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:14,069
ah spot to do on our select workspace

00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:14,789
after the session ends so this session

00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:17,069
is recorded

00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:21,839
I think this slack suggestion is a great

00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:25,919
one with 12 official minutes left as I

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:29,880
understand it and Megan correct me if

00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:33,599
I'm wrong but that I believe that that

00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:37,019
we are supposed to end at 5:10 on this

00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:40,259
schedule it would be great if people

00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:45,239
would would be willing to share with us

00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:47,459
I will provide my own email address if

00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:49,679
you don't want to share something and I

00:49:47,459 --> 00:49:51,569
can't even apparently I'm not able to

00:49:49,679 --> 00:50:00,719
type my own information or the

00:49:51,569 --> 00:50:04,919
information of my project so you know

00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:06,779
join that select channel and I think I

00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:09,059
think the the app ecosystem is

00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:10,409
interesting I think some of these issues

00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:12,959
that we've identified are interesting

00:50:10,409 --> 00:50:14,159
and I appreciate this birds of a feather

00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:17,759
sessional in a completely different

00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,959
direction than I expected I'm glad that

00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:24,109
it did thank you all so much for

00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:28,519
participating and I look forward to

00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:31,679
connecting with you each in the future

00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:38,390
I'm Megan Am I Meghan King am i right

00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:38,390
that this is the I'm a gun at five ten

00:50:40,729 --> 00:50:46,849
on this one China I don't want the

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,019
invite that I got was there's a release

00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:59,219
scheduled for a bit longer but I think

00:50:49,019 --> 00:51:02,400
we ended up at yes correct being over a

00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:03,779
little I can go over a little so with

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,039
communities only have a few people been

00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:07,259
heavily behaving people can be dealt

00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,809
with individually thousands more though

00:51:07,259 --> 00:51:12,959
it's very difficult and I think you know

00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:16,140
there's there's I don't want to call out

00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:16,710
any communities but certainly I guess

00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,599
there I think

00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:21,480
I think most of the open-source world is

00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,010
aware of some of the communication

00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,930
challenges that occurred in the node

00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:28,170
community a number of years ago

00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:31,890
certainly some of the kernel community

00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:34,589
has had toxicity called out but it

00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:36,480
sounds like from what some of you are

00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:39,480
saying that there are communities that

00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,820
have they kind of get attacked and it

00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,640
had a very tribal way and this is a

00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:50,490
phenomena I'm I'm just very interested

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:52,920
in knowing more about and does that

00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:55,940
slack channel the best place for the

00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,440
chaos community to kind of look for the

00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:04,260
people to talk to about that particular

00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:07,099
part of open-source does anyone know you

00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,099
can type it in chat

00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,830
okay and Sharov says one thing about

00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:30,500
currency normalizing is about what this

00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:31,730
kind of issue is about so I think I look

00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:37,700
a little bit more in that social

00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:43,220
currency metric myself but thank you all

00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:46,430
I think I think there's been some really

00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:52,400
good suggestions in chat and I'm very

00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:54,280
interested in this and what Megan shared

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,890
for the slack

00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:07,100
community I'll just repeat that right

00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:11,440
here at the bottom and invite you to

00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:20,650
participate in the chaos mailing list

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:20,650
yeah chaos the community / participate

00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:37,010
Cherise if I spelled that right yeah I

00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:39,890
did so we have a number of regular

00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:42,020

00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:47,720
to participate and thank you for
