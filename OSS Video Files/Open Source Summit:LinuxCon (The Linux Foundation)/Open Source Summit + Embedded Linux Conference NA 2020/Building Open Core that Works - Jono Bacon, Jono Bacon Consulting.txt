hey everyone this is john a bacon and

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,080
thank you for joining me for my session

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,280
i am i'm thrilled to be here and thank

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,559
you of course to the linux foundation

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,840
for putting all of this on

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,440
uh i hope you're all safe and well

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,200
wherever you may be in the world so

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,119
today we're going to talk about

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,480
doing open core well and i'm going to

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,359
share my screen and we're going to get

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,279
right into the action so bear with me

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,560
you lovely people all right

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,720
okay so um so

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,559
open core is a pretty let me go to that

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,800
oh hang on there we go open core it's a

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,079
pretty complicated subject it's been a

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,399
a pretty controversial subject um uh

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,760
across the open source world um and one

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,960
of the reasons for that is because

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,559
there's been a number of companies that

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,160
have sprung up in recent years that are

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,760
trying to balance this

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
this balance between an open source

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
project that adds a lot of value that

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
people can use and they can download and

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,840
they can contribute to

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
with a commercial product that sits on

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,480
top of it or sits near it

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,760
and over the years uh we've seen various

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
people expressing

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,280
uh some concerns about this you know for

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
example simon and matt and various other

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,439
people

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
and i think a lot of this this this

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,520
concern is quite reasonable

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,119
um and that's typically because kind of

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
the balance and the culture of the

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,159
participation

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
in in an open court project project is

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
just it's not quite the same as a

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
regular open source

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
open source project okay now

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,520
i've struggled with this over the over

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
the time because over the over the last

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,320
20 years that i've been involved in open

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,280
source we've seen

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
many um many companies be successful

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,759
we've seen the red hats and other folks

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
like that

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
and they've taken models that are very

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,079
very different but we're seeing a whole

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,759
range of different companies who've been

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,439
very successful with open core

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,119
and it all begs the question is this the

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,479
right thing for open source more broadly

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,000
like a good example of this is something

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,360
like vault which is a very popular open

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,520
source project and this is

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,759
this has been facilitated by hashicorp

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,240
and there's no denying their success and

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,920
there's been

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,159
a lot of people who've been incredibly

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,200
passionate about about the products that

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
they build and the projects that they're

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
working on all these different elements

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,000
so i don't really want to get into the

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,040
question of whether open core

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
is um a good model or is the right model

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
or is the best model to me

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
the thing about open core is that it can

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,920
if it's facilitated

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
correctly i think i think it can work

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,200
pretty well but i think one of the

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,720
reasons why we've seen some of this uh

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
some of these challenges with opencorn

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,959
some of this feedback and some of these

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,879
criticisms

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,280
is because culturally it's kind of

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,760
unusual to to to many open source folks

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
okay

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,599
we are a big a big collection of

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,520
cultures in the open source world you've

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,239
got open source and apache and you've

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
got

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,080
free software and all of these different

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,840
groups and it even subdivides into

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,120
specific areas such as you know the

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
ubuntu community and the debian

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,519
community and the fedora community all

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,760
of these different

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
all these different subgroupings so my

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,800
general view has been

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,239
i think open core can work well if it is

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,599
executed effectively

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,720
if i'm being completely honest with you

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
i think one of the reasons why people

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,599
struggle with it

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,640
is because many companies don't execute

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,319
it effectively

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,840
so what i want to cover in this session

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,360
is essentially my

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,959
road map of some of the things i think

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,720
we should focus on when doing

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,680
open core you've effectively decided

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,959
that you're going to work on an open

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,000
core project that's the way your

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,120
business is going to be structured

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,959
you're going to have an open source

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,920
project and then a product that sits on

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
top of it

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,920
and and and you're going to use the open

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,239
core model to generate revenue as well

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
as

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,080
building uh technology in the in the

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,159
open source project as well

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
now a lot of people i think certainly

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
when i talk to companies and i'm working

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,560
with companies around open core they

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,480
think it's a technology problem they're

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,080
like how do i configure my github repo

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,239
correctly and how do i get

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,319
um the right people involved and and how

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
do i incentivize people and how do i

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,040
how do i build the tech in a certain way

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,319
and i actually don't think it's a

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,599
technology problem i think it's a

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,440
culture problem

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,799
and it's about bridging two different

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,879
cultures you've got the open source

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,280
project over here

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,239
which is all about providing a level

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,959
playing field

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,080
open code review and issue tracking and

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,720
discussion on all these different

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
elements

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,239
and then you've got um the the company

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,760
over here

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
which is all about generating an

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
effective business and generating

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
revenue

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,000
so when we break open core down there's

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,439
kind of two primary components to this

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,879
okay we've got the project

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,120
and if you think about most open source

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,120
projects it is all about and as it

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,879
should be about a level playing field an

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,319
open source project really succeeds when

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,360
you've got a diverse range of people

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,080
participating

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
in terms of gender in terms of sex in

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,320
terms of race

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
and there's all these different elements

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,799
as well as ideas and background and

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,479
perspectives and approaches

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,240
now you've also got the product side of

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,520
things and typically with most companies

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,720
they get to make the decisions around

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
the products okay

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,400
so i think where we see these cultural

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,759
challenges is actually in this middle

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
ground is in this

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,040
this kind of connective tissue between

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,400
the project and the product

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,080
so i think when you look at the vault

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,440
and the hashicorp and another example

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,199
would be gitlab who i think have done an

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,759
amazing job

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,199
with their open core business is they've

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
really perfected that middle ground

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,040
they've nailed it they've got it down

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,639
and they've built a good cultural

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,280
connection between the project and the

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,960
product

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,800
the businesses that i think get it wrong

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,560
and the projects that get it wrong

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
there's kind of a division starts

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
forming between these two different

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
sides

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,840
so everything i'm going to cover in this

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,000
session is all about

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
understanding and refining that central

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280
middle ground okay

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,320
so i want to cover six principles i'm

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,840
going to try and get through these as

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,199
quickly as possible in session because i

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,720
want to leave some time

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,919
uh for some for some q a at the end okay

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,320
all right so let's get into the first

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,800
one the first principle really is

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,080
does the market and industry want your

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
project and products

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,080
right it might sound a little obvious

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,720
but there needs to be a need

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,400
um and uh and i think this breaks down

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,080
into a number of different areas

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,759
one is that open source really isn't a

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,800
panacea i've worked with a lot of

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,280
companies

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,479
in my career where they've got a product

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,759
and they think all we need to do is

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,919
create an open source project

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,000
we can bring people in um it's the

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,080
perfect it's the perfect situation right

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
we we gain excitement we get people

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
involved as part of the open source

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
project and then it's going to generate

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,759
a ton of leads and a ton of revenue

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,199
and in many cases that doesn't happen so

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,080
open source is not going to solve all of

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
your problems

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,080
we need to first of all break it down

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,080
into does your project actually

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,759
solve a pain point does it add some kind

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
of value does it do something that adds

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,039
value in the world

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
just being open source itself is not

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,400
enough just being free software itself

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,440
is not enough okay

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,440
so does can you create a project that in

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,039
itself completely standalone can add

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,639
value to the world

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,960
now the next question in my mind is

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,759
going to be is there a realistic

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,479
project project product market fit in

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,400
there

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,080
does the product that you create add

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,600
something valuable on top of that

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
project so a good example of that would

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
be matamos

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,720
matamos is an open source chat platform

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
it's similar to slack

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,400
and you can go and use the open source

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
version completely by itself and get a

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
load of value out of it a lot of people

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,240
do that and they've got a lovely

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,759
community wrapped around it

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
but then they've got an enterprise

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
product that sits on top of it that

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,440
helps with

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
you know corporate integration all these

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,520
different elements so there's a logical

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,759
there's a logical value on both sides of

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,479
that equation but this the next question

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,840
is going to be

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,319
are people can actually pay for the

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,520
product now sometimes it's amazing how

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,880
many businesses actually

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,240
leave this question to kind of some

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,639
other time and they'll cover that later

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
on

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
but this is really important okay

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,240
because how are they going to pay for it

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,599
and how much are they going to pay are

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
important questions

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,560
and then we also need to be clear on

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
what participation looks like especially

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,440
with competitors

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
if you're building an open source an

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,880
open core project you're going to have

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,400
to be comfortable with your competitors

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,240
potentially participating

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,840
and contributing to that project just

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,440
look at any typical open source project

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,039
look at linux lots of people

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,199
are contributing and participating in

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,960
linux from radically competing companies

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,199
okay

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
so the second uh area here is going to

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,080
be who

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,440
are your target audience right who do

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,960
you want to bring into this

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
and again this might sound like a bit of

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
a baseline element here

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,199
but i think it's really important

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,120
because there are many different

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,919
audiences out there there's users of the

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
software

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,599
there's customers who buy the product

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,879
there's what i call inner developers

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,360
these are the people who contribute to

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,800
the core open source project itself

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,560
and then you've got outer developers

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
these are the people who will build

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,080
a technology that sits on top of it such

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
as plugins or apps that sit on top of a

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,319
platform

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,759
you've got contributors in different

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,800
forms people who write docs people who

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,879
do translations

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
you've got commercial partners who will

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,440
maybe go and do affiliate

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,039
marketing and and run partner programs

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,879
these are very different audiences with

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,639
very different needs okay so we need to

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,120
be clear and prioritize who

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
who our audience should be because to be

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
completely honest with you

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,360
you're never going to be able to satisfy

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
everybody all of the time so we need to

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,039
prioritize and focus on the right pieces

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,120
so with most of the companies i work

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,800
with on the open source project side

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,279
they care most about inner developers

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,039
and users on the product side they care

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,000
about customers so we need to make sure

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,919
we design

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,959
the journey for both of those sides

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,479
because they're very different what a

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,320
customer needs will be very very

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,159
different to what an inner developer

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,680
in a project is going to need the way i

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,880
would recommend you do this is to use

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
this model i've been

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,760
kind of developing over the course of my

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,279
career i call it the community

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,040
participation framework

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,399
where the best experiences in the world

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
are journeys you know if you go to

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
disney world if you go to a good

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,680
restaurant if you buy a video game

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,279
the first steps in that journey are very

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,480
carefully orchestrated

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,000
to make sure that you can have the best

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,680
possible experience we need to do the

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
same thing with our communities

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,440
so i you know in a nutshell and i cover

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,480
this in my other talks and in my book

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,160
people powered

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,760
you define your audience which is the

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,600
little person there on the left

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
you on ramp them to to generate

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,080
something of value which is really

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,920
critical

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,760
and then you nurture them from being

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
initial casual participants to regulars

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,080
and then onto core

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,839
and the little lumps in there are the

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
incentives that you drop in to move them

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,080
forward

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,760
so if you want to build a great open

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,519
core project you need

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,279
to build an intentional journey for your

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,880
open source contributors as well as your

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,720
customers and they should be separate

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,760
if you make it the same journey that's

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
where you're going to start getting into

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,760
hot water

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,600
all right so let's get on to the third

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,160
one now this is

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,120
this is a big one do you have an open

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,959
accessible

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
project infrastructure now this is often

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
where a lot of companies who i've worked

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,440
with in open core

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
this is where they often start right but

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
there's a reason why this is number

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,680
three

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,279
of my six areas that i want you to focus

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,760
on and the reason for this is that

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,600
um we need to figure out the cultural

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,279
pieces first as i mentioned earlier on

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,560
this is this is a culture challenge

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,399
it is not a technology challenge um

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,920
now this number three here is the

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,760
technology piece of things

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,279
but if we don't have a clear have

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,040
clarity on our audiences and what they

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,640
want and how we engage with them

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,720
and the standards of conduct and

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,519
expectations if we don't have those

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,600
clear

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,839
then all of the technology decisions in

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,920
the world are not going to

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,040
fix the the lack of trust and the

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,480
cultural challenges that you're going to

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,800
face between these two different parts

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,440
of the

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,279
of the fence okay so when i think about

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,000
the open infrastructure pieces this is

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,440
all about

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,320
defaulting to open okay um use an open

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
source license

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,360
now i'm not going to get into whether it

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,640
should be a permissive license or a

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,399
copyleft license

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,720
i will leave that as an exercise for all

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,040
of you to go and enjoy that debate

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,560
um but have some kind of open source

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,360
license you can't have an open source

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,959
project

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
if you don't have an open source license

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,200
so open call requires the

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,880
the uh the the open source license you

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
absolutely need to make sure that you

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,519
have open code issues and documentation

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,120
i kind of see this as four priorities

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,800
here okay

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,800
the most critical priority is going to

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
be open code you just cannot have an

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,519
open source project if you don't have

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,360
open peer-reviewed code

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,440
the second is open issue tracking this

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,959
is where people file bugs and defects

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,800
and other bits and pieces

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,839
um the third is going to be conversation

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
you need to make sure that people can

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,640
discuss the project and what should go

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,720
into it in the architecture

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,320
and then the fourth is road mapping not

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,800
all projects have completely open road

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
mapping

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,160
i'm okay with that i'd love open road

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,360
mapping if you can do it but it's not a

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,120
core requirement

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,360
but if you want to build a real open

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,079
core community you absolutely need to

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,320
have open

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,920
code issues and communication and the

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,959
documentation piece kind of fits into

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,120
that too

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,720
so um we make sure that we've got that

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,079
peer-reviewed workflow

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
and what's important about that is that

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,959
when your engineers in your company

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,560
um submit a pull request it needs to be

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
reviewed out in the open even if the

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,279
only people who are reviewing it in the

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,200
early stages of your project

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,959
or other engineers in your company

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,880
that's fine we have to adhere to the

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,839
openness if you don't do that you're not

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,360
going to earn

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,320
the respect of it being a real open

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,519
source project okay so

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,120
and that's one of the reasons why the

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,760
the on-ramps are so critical because you

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,079
can bake

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,680
that peer review process into the

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,160
onboarding experience for example

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,760
of your inner open source developers now

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,279
the open communication i think is really

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,480
important and this can sometimes be

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,839
difficult for companies who are less

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,200
familiar with open source

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,600
who want to go down an open core

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
direction because it's culturally normal

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,880
to go into a meeting room and have a

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,240
conversation with a small set of people

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,720
but it's important that we don't do that

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
we need to make sure that we are

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,160
having conversations out in the open

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
where possible now there are exceptions

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,200
to that rule for example if you're

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,920
discussing security defects or you're

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
discussing

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,120
something that only relates to the the

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,399
commercial product you can have that

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,000
privately that's fine

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,440
but for the open source project we need

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
to operate out in the open

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,800
so the open communication channels and

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,200
meetings are essential

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,959
and as a general rule just try to avoid

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,480
code dumps again this is a cultural

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,519
difference between some companies and

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,519
some projects

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
where companies will think i dump this

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,000
massive chunk of open source code in

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
github

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,120
they're going to love it well not really

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,480
because it's actually an it's an

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
incredible amount of work to understand

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,519
that code

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,600
and and break it down and and make it

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,600
maintainable you know i i will point you

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
to star office as a historical lesson

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,279
for that particular

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
that particular piece all right so let's

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,680
get on to

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,440
number four now um i think this is

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
this is really important possibly one of

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,839
the most important elements of this

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,680
is what is the relationship between the

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,320
community and the company

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,440
this is where it is at when it comes to

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,800
open core

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
remember what i talked about with the

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
project and the product you've got that

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,839
that connective tissue in between

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,440
if you don't have a good relationship

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,480
you're gonna really struggle and this is

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
not something

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,600
you can just do once this is an ongoing

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,320
thing we build

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,120
trust as an ongoing day-to-day basis we

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,120
are judged

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,880
on the on the content of our actions not

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
just the words that we say okay

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,639
so i've got a lot to cover in this so

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,320
first of all

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
if you want to build an open core

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,519
business and project you need to

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
understand those cultural norms of open

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,000
source

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,279
because that is going to be the baseline

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,399
if you don't understand how an open

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,000
source project works and you're not

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,120
willing to commit to that

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,480
and the norms of that then you're going

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,240
to struggle with the open core model and

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,399
i just recommend that you don't do it

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
i've actually worked with four or five

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,760
companies now

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,959
where i've come in and they've asked

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
they've been interested in open core

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,800
model and i've come in to kind of help

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
them

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,160
build out the strategy and then i've

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,440
actually recommended for them not to do

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,720
it because i've not been confident

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,560
enough that they can actually

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,920
a understand those principles and be

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
commit to those principles

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,040
and if you're not willing to commit to

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,320
them it's going to be a disaster so we

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,519
set expectations around what that

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,079
participation looks like and then we

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,760
have to

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,519
equalize that community participation as

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
much as we can that's what i covered

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,399
earlier

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,399
on around making sure for example that

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,279
the the the development work is done out

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,120
in the open

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,639
even if it's the just engineers from the

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,079
company

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,680
now a critical element of this is going

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,760
to be providing training

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,279
and incentives for your staff you know

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,320
it's easy for us in the open source

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,760
world and for people who've been around

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,440
open source for a long time

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,880
to get kind of snooty about um about

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,240
about how you kind of um you know well

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,680
they should know how to do this it's

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
really easy it's not rocket science to

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,240
understand open source it's actually

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
really weird for a lot of people and

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
businesses

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,519
so you need to train them you need to

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,800
give them incentives around the right

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,000
kind of participation

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,360
there's a lot of engineers out there

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
who've never worked with open source and

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
we need to make sure that they feel

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
comfortable in doing so

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,839
and then you recognize and reward

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,399
participation within the community

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,639
itself

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,000
okay so this is really important you

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,440
never ever want to funnel all of your

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,959
engagement through a community manager

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,000
this is one of the biggest anti-patents

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,120
i've seen in my

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,880
line of work which is building

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
communities is a company will think i

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
need to build a community around open

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,600
source i'll hire a community manager

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,600
and then the entire company funnels

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
everything through that one person

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,639
open source people don't want that they

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,639
want to talk to your community your

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
staff members directly okay so that's

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,079
that's really important and then never

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,279
ever ever ever ever

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,639
spam users or or sell their information

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
or anything like that that completely

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,440
breaks down the trust

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
all right so i'm going to get into a

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,920
couple more i want to be mindful of time

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,839
and

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,959
hopefully leave a couple of minutes for

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,320
questions i know i'm getting through a

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,240
lot of content but i wanted to make sure

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,959
this was absolutely worth your

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,320
you know 25 minutes or whatever so this

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
one is about building

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,759
really strong dependable trust and

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,480
relationships now

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,519
again what i think of businesses that do

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,279
open core well

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,199
it's all about they've figured out a way

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,600
of facilitating

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,120
that trust and doing it effectively okay

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
um git lab i think are one of the most

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,800
wonderful examples of this right

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,680
get get lab contributors to the project

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,279
generally have a pretty good

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,880
relationship with the gitlab company

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,880
because the git lab company has gone out

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,399
of its way to be as open as possible

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,759
if you want an example of this go and

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
read their company handbook it's

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,079
completely out in the open

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,360
it's pretty remarkable okay so um

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,800
you've got to be intentional about

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
diverse high quality community

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,079
experiences you've got to

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,079
remember the model that i showed earlier

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,680
on about the the on-ramping and the

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,959
casual and the regular and the core if

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,399
you don't if you're not intentional

00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,920
about shaping that journey

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,120
then you're gonna essentially boil

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,240
everything down to the lowest common

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
denominator

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
then it's really important that you

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,319
build that relationship with your key

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,360
contributors don't just

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,039
see them as consumers of your community

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,400
help them to come in and shape ask for

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,000
their input tell ask them

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,559
what is going wrong how can we improve

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
how can we refine what we're doing

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,839
you want to make sure you incentivize

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
the right kind of mentoring you're more

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,799
seasoned members of your community have

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,760
to mentor the newer folks have your

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,760
staff members

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,360
take time to go and provide mentoring

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,799
and support the community you need to

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,440
make time in your staffs

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,240
uh just day-to-day work to actually

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,600
invest

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,960
their time in the community they're not

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,799
just going to be able to write code

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,080
consistently all of the time

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,840
and then you you are going to get

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,240
criticism at some point with with open

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,240
core it's it's completely normal

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,360
frankly anything to do with open source

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,559
you're going to get criticism because

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,039
there's a lot of

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,480
very good very decent but often very

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,400
vocal people out there in the world and

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,600
they keep us honest okay so i'm

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,280
sure i'm going to get criticism for

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,480
delivering this presentation and that's

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,679
fine because that's how we get better

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400
that's how we improve

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,000
so we need to uh be reasonable and

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
measured and be a listener

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,760
when it comes to that kind of criticism

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
okay all right so i'm going to get into

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,360
the final one here which is number six

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,120
and this is about open accessible

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,120
and inclusive leadership i am going to

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,000
be having a few minutes for questions if

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,880
you've got questions

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
you want to get in then feel free to pop

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,520
them into the old chat channel

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,039
and i'll get to them as quickly as i can

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,960
so this one i think is is is again

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,400
it touches on the cultural element you

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,679
know some of you may have been

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,679
coming to this session and think oh he's

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,120
going to tell us all of these specific

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,720
technical things i should do like what i

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,320
should put my readme.md and what i

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,600
should put my contribute in md

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,280
and how my um how my peer review code

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,880
process should be working and

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,039
you know how many slack channels i

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,760
should have we can get into that level

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
of detail

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,960
right there's i have a separate

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,640
presentation which i do which

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
kind of is packed with all of those kind

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,200
of detailed uh technical recommendations

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,760
but it's like an hour long okay

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,880
to me the most important thing again is

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,039
about culture

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,320
and the thing about leadership is that

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,280
psychologically

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,480
we mimic our leaders okay we all do it

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,559
and this is one of the reasons why if

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,640
you've got great leadership at the top

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,679
and they they're they're inclusive and

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
they're engaging

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,120
and they're collaborative and they're

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,919
open to criticism and feedback then you

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
get

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,760
you in many cases get that kind of

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,960
behavior in the in the community in the

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,880
organization they're at

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,400
not everybody but in many cases that

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,600
happens but if you've got bad

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
divisive uh you know bigoted leadership

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,640
then you're gonna get some of those

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,799
behavioral patterns as well okay

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,240
so um this this one's really important

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,840
clear governance for the project i think

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,919
is absolutely essential you

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,600
absolutely want to make sure that

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,120
especially if it's a larger project and

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
you want lots of different organizations

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,760
to be involved

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,360
you need to have objective leadership

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,840
now a good example of this is the linux

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,600
foundation right they have leadership

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,039
which is out there in these different

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
projects and that provides an

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,000
opportunity

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,360
for um for different companies to come

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,919
in and feel like it's an actual

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,280
level playing field okay um you also

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,559
want to base that leadership and actual

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
participation and not

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,640
just you know people who are a big deal

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,600
or a big shot you want to make sure that

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,679
people come in

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,960
and it's uh you know they've got real

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,320
merit right

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,240
especially for example in technical

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,520
steering committees you want to limit

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,600
and ideally avoid

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,720
any kind of specific privileges for any

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,520
commercial entities

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
if they're going to come into your

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,919
community they've got to earn their way

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,200
in they're going to

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,440
earn a place where they can come and

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,280
actively participate you've got to

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,280
really define very clear policy

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,880
when it comes to that that bridge that

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,919
connective tissue between the product

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,919
and the project

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,159
so this is especially important for the

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,000
company you've got to make it very clear

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
how your engineers how your participants

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,440
operate in the community

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,600
so it fits in line with the open culture

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,120
which is the open bit in open core

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,039
and then always being open and

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,320
transparent in what you do and this is

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,159
the final one

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,440
if you if you wanna if you need a legal

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
entity for your open

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,520
project go to an existing foundation

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,200
don't set up a new one a new dedicated

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,640
foundation it's incredibly expensive

00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,440
it's incredibly complicated and it takes

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,799
forever

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,159
just go to an existing foundation

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,200
whether it's the linux foundation apache

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,960
or something else okay

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,679
that's the place to do it all right so

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,159
we've got just a couple of minutes left

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,919
one final point like when i mention open

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,720
core and twitter elsewhere people start

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,799
fighting

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,000
and we're all learning you know when i

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,679
first got involved in open source

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
in the late 90s we hadn't got any of

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,640
this stuff figured out and we've learned

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
over the course of the last 10 or 15

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880
years

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,559
because we've shared interesting

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
insights and ideas okay

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,000
so i think we need to explore all kinds

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,720
of models with open source and how to do

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,039
them well

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,039
um and open core is one of them so i

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,120
just encourage us all to have a view of

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,640
of being have been um open and

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,280
transparent in terms of how we

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,880
have these conversations um and then i'd

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,080
certainly love to hear your feedback let

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
me know on twitter in the chat and

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,120
comments and elsewhere

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,280
and i'm going to wrap it up and get to

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
some questions all right hang on let me

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,720
stop

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,679
sharing my screen let me go to

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,679
hang on bear with me

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,080
all right let me go to the questions now

00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,280
we've only got a couple of minutes i'm

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,559
going to blast through these as quickly

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
as possible

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,320
eduardo silva any advice for how to

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,240
avoid friction on features in open

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,679
source versus the product

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,360
i think the general view that i would

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,120
take here is that the project

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,480
the open source project should be the

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,400
features that are going to be broadly

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,360
and generally available to everybody

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
and you want to make sure that the

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,200
product is going to really i think

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,640
commercial integration and optimization

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
is the best way to focus on the product

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,840
but it depends

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,440
largely on what kind of what kind of

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,880
technology you're building

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,200
what i think is very important is that

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,480
you set the expectations of what happens

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,600
if someone creates an open source

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,720
equivalent

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,720
to the um the commercial feature and

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,080
to me you should never squash code let

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,520
people have that code available

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
elsewhere but sometimes you may have to

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,400
have a policy that says we won't include

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,840
this because it competes with the

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
commercial product you need to draw that

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,600
line

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,840
yourself in terms of what you feel

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,600
comfortable with that

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,039
uh lucas galvini uh galvanini

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,720
once i have a small community what point

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,400
should i invest more at what point

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
should i invest more time in

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,520
i would at the beginning absolutely

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,520
focus on the on-ramp

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,520
um creating that in identify your

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,320
audiences create the on-ramp

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,919
um and and certainly in the first few

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,440
stages of someone joining the community

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,880
make sure that people have got access to

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,159
good quality mentoring

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,520
i can't go into detail about this

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,880
because we don't have enough time i

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,240
don't want to pitch anything too hard

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,720
but definitely go and get my book people

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
powered

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,760
it walks through how to go through that

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,799
step by step uh

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,720
nithya nithya ruff who is an amazing

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,080
person uh some of the criticism about

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,760
open core is around advocating for

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,360
license restrictions or change

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,559
to allow business models can you comment

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,880
on this um is it about using open source

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,400
osi curated licenses only or not

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,840
allowing license changes

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,159
i think you need to use an open source

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,080
license um i get why we've got these

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,600
licenses that are propagating

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,360
in terms of restricting what people can

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,880
do it's not open source use an open

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,760
source license is my personal take on

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
this

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,000
uh jono uh this is gordon half what is

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,360
your take on clas

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,600
um um i think clas are

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,880
fine um i mean i think it's part and

00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,919
parcel of running a large scale open

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
source project

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,840
i just think you need to make sure that

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,799
um the process is clear people

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,159
understand their rights

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,159
understand what they're signing i think

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,640
it's totally fine liz rice what are your

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,520
favorite

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,279
good bad uh examples of open core not

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,559
pure open source projects working well

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,400
in foundations um not

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,080
oh i see open court i mean i gave some

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,799
examples earlier on i think i think

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,039
vault

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,640
hashicorp uh gitlab i think great

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,600
examples i think matamos is a great

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,120
example

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,720
um in terms of bad examples

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
i don't know actually i mean i don't

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,159
really i'd rather spread the world as

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,520
rather spread sugar around the world

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,480
than vinegar

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,000
so let's just focus on the good stuff um

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,559
and then i think i've got like 20

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,720
seconds

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,240
to answer a steve wally question any

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,200
advice in keeping customers and

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,400
community separate um i don't think you

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,919
should keep them separate i think the

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,880
customers should be welcomed and be part

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,400
of your community

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,240
but i think the cultural norms of both

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
sides need to be very clear all right

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,880
