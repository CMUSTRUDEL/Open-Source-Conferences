hello everybody

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,720
and uh welcome to the session called

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,280
becoming data driven

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,880
well becoming a data driven organization

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
uh my name is mandy chessel

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,720
i'm the leader of an open source project

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,720
called odpi algeria

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,560
i'd like to talk a little bit about the

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,519
background of this project

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,560
uh why why we created this open source

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,599
project

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,960
and the value that can come from

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:35,280
from using it within an organization

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,800
um the story starts back in 2013

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,320
i was working with the ing

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,360
bank this is a global bank and they were

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,039
interested in building a data lake

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,640
and they had a number of requirements

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,760
because they're a bank they have

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,199
the a lot of regulations around how they

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,760
use data

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,280
and they're also very concerned that

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,640
their customer data

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,680
wasn't lost they knew exactly what was

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
happening to it

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,159
and it was being used in an ethical way

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,040
so we came up with this

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,360
architecture for a data lake that looked

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
at

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,479
all the different requirements that they

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,759
needed for data

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,600
um and uh and it became

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,880
a very successful architecture within

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,360
the bank

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,360
and has been used with many different uh

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,000
organizations around the world

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,880
so i spend a lot of my time working with

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,040
companies

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,280
on their data strategy how they make

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,079
better use of data

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,799
and ensure that it's properly governed

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,159
so

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,280
the experience that we had with the

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,720
uh that data lake architecture

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,159
resulted in a number of books

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,799
um and it was very well received um

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,759
because it helped to guide people on all

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,880
the decisions that they needed to make

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,240
however there was a problem with it

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,439
in that it was an awful lot of effort to

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,399
build so

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,000
this is a sort of cross-section through

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
the different technologies that

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
are used within a data lake and at the

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,720
base you can see

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,319
certain barely standard commercial

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
products and you can use open source

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,680
products in those spaces as well

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
but um an awful lot of what made the

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,120
data lake

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
a data lake was actually handwritten

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319
components that the organization needed

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,440
to build

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,720
and there was an awful lot of

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,360
integration between those components

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,000
as well so data lakes became very

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,480
expensive to build even when you had

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
a fairly well-defined blueprint to

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
create

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,480
them the other thing that we discovered

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,680
was that as an organization becomes data

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,720
driven

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,480
everything changes um the way that

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,000
projects are funded

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
typically they're funded sort of on

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
application lines

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,760
data-driven organizations need to fund a

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,390
lateral flow

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,400
of data between the data silos

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,360
[Music]

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,000
and then so then that that creates um a

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,840
completely new way that uh sort of

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,040
resources need to be uh um

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,879
need to be distributed around the

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
organization

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,920
it becomes very important that

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,120
development projects

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,200
are using uh real data um

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,840
to you know in order to test and and

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
manage the services that they're

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,760
building

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,400
the regulations around data

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
such as the gdpr actually start to

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,120
combine

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,159
the governance domains between

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,799
the data privacy people the data

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,720
governance people the it infrastructure

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
people the security people and so we

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,319
need to start bringing

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,879
uh that metadata together that they're

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,959
using the policy metadata

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
and so what what's happening is that a

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
huge number of tools

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,840
used by many different professions

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,519
need to be integrated in order for that

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,840
knowledge that's being

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,159
created by one group of professionals

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
can be shared and used and linked

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,760
to the knowledge from other

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,919
professionals and that that

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,440
that body of knowledge is what we call

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,919
metadata

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
um and so having gone through this

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,400
process with ing

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,520
and a number of other very large

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,080
companies we wrote another book

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,400
that basically said you know this is the

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,600
reason that data lakes are very hard

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,280
to write which are to create and also

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,600
why it's hard for an organization to

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,560
become a data driven organization

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
um and one of the things that uh was in

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,960
was in this book

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,240
in this book was um the idea of

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,000
a maturity model for an organization

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,120
here i'll show that to you

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,720
um that actually starts from you know

00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,680
sort of where is my data that's this

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,800
very low

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
um data data awareness and then sort of

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,600
how should that

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
then knowing how it should be governed

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
that's governance awareness

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,880
then starting to embed that into all the

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,000
technologies that are working with the

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,000
data

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
that's embedded governance then building

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,320
up to allowing

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
the business users to own the settings

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,039
of governance so as they

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,520
make changes to those settings uh they

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,680
um

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,080
the data lake and the other processes

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
that are managing data change with it

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,400
and then finally something called data

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,919
citizenship which uh comes from

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,240
forester is the idea that all employees

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,479
are

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,400
enabled with the data that they need and

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,360
they work with data as a

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,479
as a normal part of their operation so

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,280
these different levels

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,120
um had different types of technology

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,639
integration requirements

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,560
between them and when you started to

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,160
look at any organization

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,720
you realize that this is a huge

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,280
requirement to get all this metadata and

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,840
tools integrated

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,400
and so what we proposed was that we need

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,400
to use an open source project to

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,560
link together all the different metadata

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,039
standards and provide a platform

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,039
to enable an organization to create that

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,800
data driven

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,720
layer to link together all the tools

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,080
that they needed

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
and we sort of started to think well

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,400
what's an example of a good

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,600
um a way metadata work is working very

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,919
well

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,199
and one of the examples we looked at was

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,080
photographic metadata so if you think of

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,440
a digital camera today when you take a

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,360
photograph

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,000
an awful lot of information is captured

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,319
about where you were

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,520
the time date settings of the camera and

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,440
things and that's

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,639
captured in a standard way and stored

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,800
with the photo

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,039
so when you then load it up into a

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,479
program um you know sort of a photograph

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,319
management program

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,440
all of that metadata is available and

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960
then you can add to it and share it

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,960
and that's really what we want to enable

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,919
with all types of data

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
um since most data particularly within a

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
business

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,400
has no metadata associated with it

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,960
so we came up with what we call the

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,560
the metadata and governance manifesto

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,039
and this talks about

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,720
the requirements for managing metadata

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,319
that's required by a data driven

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,000
organization

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,919
so automation is key open standards

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,240
um open interfaces making this metadata

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,240
visible and usable across a wide range

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,759
of technologies all of these

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,919
um pieces require

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,240
both open source projects and different

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,720
vendor technologies to come together

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,599
and work together to allow an

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,120
organization

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,599
to make better use of their data

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,199
we then looked at what types of data of

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,960
metadata do we need

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,720
and this is a sort of very high level

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,720
patchwork quilt of the different

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,599
standards that we brought together

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,199
to describe the data assets and that's a

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,800
broad definition that's

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,000
the thing the um sort of

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,120
it's sort of data stores obviously uh

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,800
feeds and data data moving in in

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,240
different feeds and

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,840
apis and event type

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,199
in data sources uh so the wide range

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
there's the infrastructure that sits

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,080
underneath

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,159
it there's the lineage that's the flow

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
of processing that actually created the

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,279
data set

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,479
all the different governance

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,719
requirements from

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,519
policies and terms and conditions

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,120
classifications

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,519
and different types of procedures that

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,640
have to happen around data

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,200
glossary describes the meaning of data

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,959
and

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
and you build sort of ontologies of

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,120
different domains of

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,399
of metadata the collaboration is the

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
feedback from the people who are

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,880
actually using the data so

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,440
likes and comments and reviews and

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,959
things on the different data assets

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
then we've got the data standards and

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
reference data so this

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,720
helps to reduce the cost if things are

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,120
more consistent

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
and then finally metadata discovery is

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
uh is

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,920
where you have automatic processes that

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
are looking into the assets

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,440
and decide i i'm basically calculating

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,560
the profile and various other things

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,240
um that are being used so there's a wide

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,160
range of metadata

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
and if i show you the next picture this

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,959
is just sort of the next

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,959
uh level of detail doesn't seem to have

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,080
been displaying very well

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,279
um oh i see

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,480
um and so um sorry i was a different

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,040
picture i was expecting

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,360
so this picture is showing um sort of an

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,399
example of that type of metadata so

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,279
at this bottom layer you have um

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,880
the uh um the sort of structural

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,160
information so this is what a lot of

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,360
people think of when they think of

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,360
metadata so

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,959
the database schema is an example of

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,040
this structural data and it shows you

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,480
the fields that are in the data

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,360
and an idea there's some sort of

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,120
symbolic name of what that data means

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,079
um and then the next thing that we add

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,440
is uh links to glossary terms if you

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
remember the glossary

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,760
and this starts to give you a much

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,120
clearer definition of exactly what

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,880
this means and there'll be an

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,839
explanation of of

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,399
of uh sort of it it's real definition

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,000
associated with this label

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,640
and then we can get really fancy and

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,040
start linking it together to show

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,720
how values relate to one another so we

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,480
can start to say well these are all part

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,040
of an employee which means

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,040
potentially they could be personal data

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,519
because we're bringing it together

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,720
and then finally we can be very um

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,480
explicit

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:58,000
and start to tag uh the metadata with

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,880
um the uh with

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,440
flags to say which which uh pieces are

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,720
sensitive

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,720
and this picture which was the one i was

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,079
expecting earlier it shows you

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,480
um some of the detail of that metadata

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,440
structure and and for edgier we've

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,240
actually defined nearly 500 types

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,680
that are part of the metadata

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,680
requirements

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,600
and the linkage between them for a

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,320
data-driven organization

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,839
so it's a huge undertaking uh that we're

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,720
we're

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:34,079
uh aiming to uh support

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
through the algeria project

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,360
i mentioned earlier that um that we're

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
trying to connect together many

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,160
different tools and there are many

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,560
different tools involved

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,240
so imagine that the fluffy cloud that's

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
open metadata and governance that's what

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,160
the

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,480
odpi exeria project supports

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,560
and then it has connection points to all

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,800
the different types of tools

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
that need to exchange metadata and it's

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,720
not just databases um

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:06,240
it is reporting tools and security

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,240
and different developer tools and things

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,279
like that so there's a huge range

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,000
of um of uh uh

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,560
values i see a great potential question

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,600
coming in

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,959
nope um and uh and so that's really what

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,320
ajiri is doing

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,959
but of course um

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,399
it's not the world is not to sort of the

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,680
place where you could just have one

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,959
single database

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,000
that everything is connecting to in fact

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,839
many tools have their own database with

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,240
metadata in them so what a jira is

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,120
trying to do is to create a peer-to-peer

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,760
protocol between these repositories to

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,680
um

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,600
allow them to allow them to exchange the

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,639
metadata that they need so

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,160
they don't need modifying basically we

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,160
create connectors that link them

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,680
together and exchange the metadata that

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
each repository cares about

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,680
the other thing that um when you start

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,600
looking at pictures like that

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,399
it looks quite straightforward but

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,560
actually the real world is

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,399
multi-cloud multi-platform

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,240
highly distributed and so our solution

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
has to work in this environment and

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,880
again

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,240
a single centralized place that

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,560
everything is connecting to

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,440
really doesn't work so when i said this

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,760
is a peer-to-peer distributed protocol

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,000
uh the orange here that's gone into the

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,839
the picture is really showing

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,839
where the metadata is located and the

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,360
dotted line shows the integration that

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,560
algeria does

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,240
under the covers to create the illusion

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,800
that there is one single

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,800
virtual view of metadata that each of

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,800
the repositories are connecting to

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,839
but actually they are um they are

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,399
all part of uh you know they were they

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,560
are actually

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,839
separate um but connected through the

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,720
algeria protocols

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,000
the other thing uh that makes this a

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,639
little bit harder

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,800
is that different capabilities different

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,560
technologies have different capabilities

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,800
when it comes to integration

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
so for example a relational database

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
typically

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
is what i would call a passive

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,680
technology it has open apis

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,399
but it doesn't send out any

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,440
notifications when it's schemas change

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,279
so we need to to periodically poll it

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,600
and validate that we've got all the

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,519
metadata that we that

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,519
is all the schema information that's

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,720
been defined in that repository so

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,480
that's a passive um technology um

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,560
something like apache cassandra

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,639
is an active technology and it creates

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,959
an event every time a new schema is

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,120
created in cassandra

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,399
in its own format so what we have to do

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,519
is to listen

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,639
um and then convert it to our format and

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,560
bring it through

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,440
so we have um specialist servers

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,040
that are sitting listening or polling

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,839
different technologies

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,560
to continuously automate the capture of

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,600
metadata from different technologies

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,040
we also have apis that um

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,160
that uis and uh other sort of scripting

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,560
tools and things

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,839
can allow um sort of more manual capture

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,279
of metadata

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,040
as required and they connect into

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,320
specialist interfaces for the different

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,600
types of tools

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
which are then brought into the

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,079
ecosystem and shared

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,800
so when we look at um

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,560
the uh sort of a connected environment

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,920
what you see is in the center there's a

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,440
thing here called

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,399
cohort a and that's a set

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,399
of tools that are sharing metadata and

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,079
the cohort is built dynamically it

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,600
automatically configures itself

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,800
as new members join or leave and when

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,800
a member joins they pass information

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,480
about themselves and that automatically

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,880
configures the other members

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
so that they can now issue queries on

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,600
the new member that's just joined

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,079
the cohort and then connected off of

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,079
those

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,920
uh sort of co-op members as we call them

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,360
are other servers the sort of governance

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,959
servers that are connecting into

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,000
different technologies

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,759
um and providing and and sort of

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,240
gathering metadata

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,839
we also push metadata so in this picture

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,839
you can see at the bottom

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,519
there's metadata being gathered from

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,600
different data platforms

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,199
but then at the top um on the left hand

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
side you can see that

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,360
we're actually pushing metadata to

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,079
apache ranger and a data virtualization

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,560
tool

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,560
to dynamically create secured views over

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,920
the data that's being added

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,240
to the ecosystem so even though the

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,440
metadata is gathered in one tool it can

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,040
be consumed and

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,839
used by a different tool and even though

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,839
these tools are surrounding the same

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
data

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,920
the other thing um that we need to

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,440
be mindful of is when you think about

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,839
that distributed

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,120
environment we've got some some

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
technology that's running in a

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,959
centralized cloud environment

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,799
needs to be highly scalable needs to be

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,919
continuously available

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,600
we have other places where

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,919
it may be a small team that has a

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,199
variety of requirements so we might need

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,880
to sort of have lots of different

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,240
servers sitting on the same

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,880
platform so that it uh so that we have

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,880
a sort of multi-tenant or a sort of

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,919
consolidated environment for small

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,440
situations and then in the iot space we

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,000
may need to run on something as small as

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,880
a raspberry pi and so the ageria

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,280
technology

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
has um i think called the omag server

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,760
platform that hosts

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,440
all the uh integration technology and it

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,840
can be configured in lots of different

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,799
ways to allow us to go from the smallest

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,919
machine

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,039
up to the largest cloud environment

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,960
using the same technology and just by

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,960
altering it to its configuration

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,919
so the aim is that when we um when an

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,960
organization

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,480
is using nigeria so in this picture here

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,600
uh the uh the blue is the light blue is

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,200
is a geria

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,200
and you can see that there are lots of

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,679
different technologies that are

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,880
connecting and supporting different

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,919
communities so there's a sort of

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,000
community

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,200
of different professionals uh connected

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,760
at each point

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,559
and algeria will gather the metadata

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,520
that is

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,039
that is of value to that community by

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,360
their interaction it uses their

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,200
interaction and their activity

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,440
and its configuration in order to

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,200
determine what metadata is gathered at

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,640
any one of those points

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,480
but the result is that um one group of

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,240
users might create information about a

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,400
data set

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,960
that is then shared somebody else may

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
add classifications to it to identify

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,280
where sensitive data is

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,760
that might then go on to configure a

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,679
security tool

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,919
and may also create reports for the

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,799
privacy team so that they can see

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,160
that private data is now being deployed

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,120
to a new location

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
so you can start to see how the value of

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,400
of the knowledge

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,200
is is shared and augmented and shared

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
again

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,880
um as we bring this um this ecosystem

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,880
together

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,080
now uh technology is important um but

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,520
this open source project

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,320
also focuses on creating

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,120
a secure and conformant environment so

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
that

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,400
technologies from different vendors can

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,080
be connected together safely and they

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,240
don't corrupt one another

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,520
and also we're interested in in in

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,919
helping

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,679
people who are trying to transition

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,480
their organization to become more data

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
driven

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,640
with education examples suggested best

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,559
practices

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,160
that then link down into the algeria

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,160
technology and show

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,320
how it can be used because this is an

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,760
incredibly complicated topic and there's

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,799
an awful lot of people

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,360
being given data-oriented roles that uh

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,400
um that they've never done before and so

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,919
the the aim

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,559
um in the juria project is to make sure

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,240
that we

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,480
um we help people as much as possible

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,840
both in the technology that we provide

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,679
but also in the

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240
the advice and the best practices that

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,559
are linked with it

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,640
uh we are um completely open project

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,159
uh everything we've done has been

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,320
created through github

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,600
we have a number of companies that are

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,799
working together

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,080
to create this common technology

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:41,280
and so everything that we we show

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,400
we use is available through our various

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,159
github repositories

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,640
um the the technology itself is

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,080
organized into three layers

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,000
there's what we call the developers

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,039
toolkit at the bottom which

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,960
uh is all the libraries and plug points

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,799
and connector interfaces

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
to allow you to build your own

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,760
integration environment

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,679
depending on the technologies that you

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,200
need you use

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,120
then above that is what we call the

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,960
integration platform and these are the

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
pre-built connectors for different

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,200
technologies

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,600
so these are the things you don't have

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,000
to write and then there are some

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,280
uis that make it easier to monitor

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
what's happening

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,360
in the integration environment and then

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,799
finally we have the governance solutions

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,679
that sit on top

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,240
and they um exploit the fact that we now

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,720
have

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,720
this view of metadata view of the

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,440
organization and its operations

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,559
that has never been visible before until

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,360
the solutions start

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,960
to take advantage of that and allow

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,840
people to

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,000
a more powerful use of the metadata that

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,360
they've created

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,799
so that was a bit of a whistle stop tour

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,440
on um on odp algeria and what it what it

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,360
potentially can do for your organization

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,960
i have some time for some questions

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,720
um so we can put the questions slide up

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,880
i don't have a um any questions

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,880
there now but if anybody would like to

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,559
leave leave anybody got any questions

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,760
i'm happy to

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,400
answer them now um

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,600
otherwise i will move you over to the

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,200
links page

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,000
and you can see here we've got a number

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,480
of um press releases and external things

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
but

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,840
really everything that you need to know

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,320
um

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,520
is in our those two github repositories

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,840
that i'm showing you

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,039
the data governance one is the one that

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,840
contains

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,480
all the best practices um and then the

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,480
algeria one is the source code and all

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,960
the documentation for the exeria

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
software

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,840
so that's it so if there are no

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
questions

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:08,320
