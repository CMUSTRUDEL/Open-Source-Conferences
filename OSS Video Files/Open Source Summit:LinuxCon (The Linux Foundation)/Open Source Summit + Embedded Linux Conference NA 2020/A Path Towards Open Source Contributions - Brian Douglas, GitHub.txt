hi my name is brian douglas and i'm

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,319
going to be giving a talk about

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,359
open source contributions uh in

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,000
particular

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,160
open source contributions from

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
communities that are underrepresented

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,240
um i've got a unique experience i'd like

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,000
to share um so just keep that lens

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,400
but before i actually start i wanted to

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,600
jump into a concept so

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,480
um hbcu is a it's an acronym used in the

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,560
us for

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,920
historically black colleges or

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
universities

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,519
uh and this was a necessity that came

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,559
out of

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,760
um well basically out of segregation

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,680
segregation

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,600
um we're coming at the time of this

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,239
recording we're only a few days away

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,719
from the

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,399
uh anniversary of juneteenth which is

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,320
the the actual mark

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,559
of two years after emancipate

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,760
emancipation proclamation which is

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,120
um the the law that actually freed all

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,960
uh enslaved peoples in the us

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,239
it took two years until the last person

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,879
was actually freed

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,160
when actually let them know in texas so

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,479
that's a big date for

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,159
for black people in the u.s african

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,119
americans

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,240
because it marks a time where not only

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,159
were we

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,840
blocked from access to a lot of things

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
we were also oppressed but

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,320
uh i sailed this because three years

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,720
after that date we actually had

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,400
one of the earlier hbcus one of the more

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,520
successful ones as well which is hampton

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,880
university

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,840
hampton university is actually was

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,920
started in 1868

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,600
and the goal was really just to teach

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,439
black people in the u.s

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,119
skills and trade and things to actually

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,360
get them out of like the systematic

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,119
things that were sort of oppressing them

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,840
and give them a way to basically make

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,079
money and and have a lifestyle

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,439
this is one of many black colleges in

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,320
the us that were created around this

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,159
time

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,439
and one of the the feuds actually remain

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,720
until this day

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,079
one of the actually alumnus of of

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,159
hampton university is booker t

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,680
washington and um but we don't go to

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,399
more detail i just wanted to build

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,759
just a context around there were a group

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,560
of people in the u.s who really just did

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,720
not have access to information

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,239
and the historical black colleges they

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,800
still are around thanks to the civil

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,720
rights

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
movement back in 1964 that was

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,400
established

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
to basically honor these institutions

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,239
that were around

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,280
at a time where people in the u.s could

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,800
not have access

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,000
this type of information it's like

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
regular information that we just take

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,720
for granted

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,319
and i think that sort of same context

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
and the same lens actually lends itself

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,000
to open source and

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
i'll go deeper in that story not

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,200
specifically to black colleges but

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,560
more about the access to information

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
that's really the goal around this talk

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,160
before i jump into that i actually want

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,879
to talk about my path in open source

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,760
and my path actually came around the

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,959
time

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,400
2015 node.js was actually pretty

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,959
up and coming and i had the task to

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
create a group a group of black

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,599
engineers

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
and designers and business people who

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
wanted to collect

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,040
and build startups build ideas together

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,040
and this group is called steamrollers

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,080
it's no longer around today but it was

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,280
built on slack

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,159
and another another um platform called

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
typeform

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
because at the time slack you could not

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,720
actually invite people to your slack

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,120
group without

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
manually sending them email so we wanted

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
to automate the process

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
of inviting more people to our group and

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,159
the way we did this is well the way i

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,000
did it because i was actually nominated

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,599
as a tech lead i was uh

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
despite being a junior engineer i

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
actually had the most technical

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
experience

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,519
and was able to build an automation

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,480
uh basically a bot to whenever someone

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,280
submitted their names

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,319
to a form or to the type form it would

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,480
then send an email

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,360
to join the slack room super trivial

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,959
it's something that's actually

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,159
super solved today um but yeah so my

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:54,080
my interaction was really just to

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,439
to um to make this work and

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,040
the best way i can actually make it work

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,239
is through javascript or specifically

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,720
node.js

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,640
and uh what i like about it is that

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,879
node.js actually it was

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,640
pretty available um this the solution i

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,599
found was actually open source

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,720
and i found it um through this guy chad

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,319
he actually

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,239
had a stuff open source and i went i

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,200
went on github found this profile

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,880
because i had a lot of questions

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,320
actually did not really know how to use

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,639
node.js properly

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,240
um i was at the time only writing ruby

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,600
code for work

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,520
and then offloading all my front-end

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,560
javascript stuff to another

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,919
developer so i had to learn how to do

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,520
node.js and i learned how to use this

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,720
project because it basically solved all

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,720
the problems i wanted to do

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,400
except it just wasn't working properly

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,680
and at the time there's a whole iojs

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
thing that was happening that i wasn't

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,479
aware of

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,720
and chad was able to actually get me

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,240
through that

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
not easily it was like actually a lot of

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,080
back and forth through our weekend

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
to the point where he actually solved

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
the problem and what i

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,639
appreciate this nick's experience and my

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,720
experience in open source is that chad

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,320
never once despite me emailing him in

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,639
his personal email account

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,320
he never once said hey uh please stop

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,759
emailing hey this is not the proper way

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,520
to do open source hey

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,199
you're doing it wrong he actually just

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
answered my questions and he answered

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,080
the questions where

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
i got to the point where i it worked and

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,360
i was able to move on

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
and get the project run up and running

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
um but also the entire time he was

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
actually in thailand

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,840
uh at a k-pop concert which he showed me

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,120
a picture here and i was super

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,919
appreciative that he took the time out

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
of his

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,639
his day his week his evening to actually

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
answer my questions and help me along

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
um and i think there's a lot there's a

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,160
lot to like learn from that story and

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,680
that i want to share with other people

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,400
too like going forward like

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,440
someone actually spent the time to to

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,080
mentor me

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,080
and and grow my career into open source

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,960
and i'm super appreciative of that

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
now today open source is pretty

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,800
synonymous with most development

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
um it's i don't think you could write

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
code full time at any company and not

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
touch

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,479
an open source project i mean there are

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
at least 10

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
organizations that don't use open source

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,120
which i have

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,639
a bunch of server data from blackduck

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,360
which is a security company

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,120
and here you can see the majority of

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,800
companies are using open source um

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,319
it's actually pretty synonymous uh looks

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,000
like 96 percent of the

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,440
thousand applications that are audited

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,080
in 2016 contain

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,680
something open source so as i mentioned

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
open source is pretty synonymous like

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,759
when

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,759
it's like ingrained in the way we do

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,199
code today

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,840
now according to the some actual hiring

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,600
data from

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,600
uh the linux foundation as well as dice

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
jobs and appreciate everybody putting

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
this information out there and really

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,840
helps

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,440
help my story but also helps everybody

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,880
else to sort of understand

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,400
that open source is super valuable like

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
opens there's a lot of companies that

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,520
leverage the github profile or your

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,639
contributions or

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,400
to either identify

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,680
candidates but also it's a good way to

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,199
actually source candidates

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,039
if you have an open source project out

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
there and you're getting contributions

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,240
it's a good idea it's a good way for

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,199
people to actually

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,720
engage the company itself or the company

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,440
itself to engage

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
those developers so if i get some all

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,000
that

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
that i just those last few slides that

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,400
open source is actually really valuable

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,400
for your career you can't really move on

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,720
without it

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,720
so with all that being said i work for

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,400
this company called github

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
i like to imagine that everybody's first

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
issue is or sorry everybody's first

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,599
experience could be their first issue

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,520
and that's a quote that i sort of

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,120
butchered from stan lee which uh he was

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,400
in the context of comic books

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,440
that i want to set the stage and i just

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,880
want to make sure everybody knows what

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,479
github is if you don't know what it is

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,319
it's a collaboration platform

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,240
for developers it's a way for you to

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,160
sort of connect the people to the code

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,759
uh and that's that's what it is and i

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,560
personally am a developer advocate at

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
github

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,599
that's my name i'm brian douglas and

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,919
this is what i look like on the internet

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,879
as well so thank you for the opportunity

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,479
thank you for the opportunity to be

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,800
actually

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,720
listening to my talk uh and this as well

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
as the linux foundation for

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,240
uh hosting this wonderful open source

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,160
summit

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,479
i also joke that i'm a beyonce advocate

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,879
and this is intentional because

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,840
github is a lot of users and beyonce has

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,360
a lot of listeners

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,599
and i like to say i go to bat for the

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,199
hive and that's what i do for

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,199
for github uh specifically i'm also an

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,879
erg lead for

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,120
sorry i'm a co-lead for the one of our

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,680
black ergs or the black erg

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
at github this is an employee resource

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,639
group

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,599
that's what the erg stands for and it

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,680
really focuses on

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,960
retention growth of the black community

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,360
at github as well as

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,080
the black community that uses github

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,319
specifically

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,560
so the black cat is something that came

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,320
up back in 2017. one of my colleagues

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,839
at github is who's still there and i

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
actually co-lead with the the black the

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,599
cat crg

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,959
um she came up with the idea of like hey

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,120
we have all these active cats who had

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,279
like the woo trader cat we've got some

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,640
cats that represent the indian community

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,560
uh we've got japanese

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,080
uh representation of cats like why don't

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
we have a black cat

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
um and i think everybody sort of just

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
said yeah

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,880
we should definitely have a blanket cat

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,360
so right off the bat

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,800
because github is built on github i can

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,160
go back and see all the issues so this

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
is actually excerpts

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,000
of people screenshotting different ideas

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
for for octocats

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,120
and they were looking for prominent

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,399
black figures so figures to the same

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
caliber of like booker

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,920
um but we ended up not falling on any of

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,680
these octocats

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
um or sorry any of these black figures

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,680
we actually

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,399
decided on benjamin banneker uh and the

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,920
reason

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,000
for benjamin banneker is benjamin

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,399
bennicker uh despite

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,880
the existence of hbcus benjamin banneker

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,000
did not actually attend in hcbcu

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,560
um he actually uh

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,080
uh was self-taught and taught himself

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,200
science and math

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,320
and astronomy all on his own i

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,160
personally have never heard of benjamin

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,640
manicure until i joined github

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,480
and i think for the majority most people

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,160
haven't heard of benjamin banneker

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
um but i think one of the biggest deals

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,519
about benjamin banneker is that

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,360
he um he actually helped out with the

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,959
civil engineering in washington dc

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
but he also wrote letters to thomas

00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,279
jefferson and he wrote letters to thomas

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
jefferson

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,959
on a regular basis to the point where

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,760
thomas jefferson started understanding

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,959
the fact that

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,880
perhaps um black people were were more

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,440
than just you know three-fifths of a man

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,279
and that they were actually able to uh

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,200
have educated conversations which was

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,720
not a common concept

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,040
at the time so i say all this because

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,519
the benjamin manacat i think is really

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,160
important to the black the cats because

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,800
it actually is a representation of we

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,959
are seen

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,720
and we are heard at github and we

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,680
represent a very strong voice at github

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,839
2 as well though

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,959
we aren't you know a ton of people i

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,399
think i said today

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,920
uh we have uh 60 active members of

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,839
of the blacktights that doesn't

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,360
encompass all black

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,360
employees at github but these are all

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
active members who who

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,480
join on meetings and actually push

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,800
towards ideas

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,200
2019 we had a black account mini summit

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,000
so github itself is a remote company

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,519
we're focused uh all across the world

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,079
our user base is

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,600
actually across the world as well and we

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,920
all get together

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,360
once a year to all basically see each

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,279
other in the same room

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
and actually work on different projects

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,760
and different goals

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,760
and the goals that we sort of came out

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,360
of that in 2019 was

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,959
one our main top line goal was to

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,399
attract and empower black lives and tech

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,480
and that's what i was talking about of

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,680
internal focus but also external

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,200
um and out of these goals

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,279
one of the goals i worked on personally

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,000
was open source and education

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,320
we had a really strong goal of like

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,959
there

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
is there is this thought around the

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,200
pipeline

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,079
of black engineers being very small um

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,640
the hbcu market uh historically black

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,600
colleges

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,360
exist because pipeline of getting people

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,120
in education actually giving them to

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,639
complete education higher education

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,959
specifically black individuals

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,880
has historically been a challenge i know

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
it's better much now today

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,720
but when you when you think about um

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,320
recruitment

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,480
uh and education uh of

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,560
black individuals uh i don't think uh

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,240
when you start thinking about tech

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,240
hbcus don't really come up a lot in the

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,880
conversation so there's more and more of

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,040
a reason for us to constantly try to

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,320
talk to the top of the funnel at the

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,560
pipeline if you think of

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,480
onboarding engineers as a funnel you

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,560
know 16 17 year olds

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,720
college students education is really

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,440
important and one thing that we found as

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
well

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,839
is that the country uh quite a few uh

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,120
african countries but specifically

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
nigeria

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,480
as far as open source contributions and

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
contributors

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,399
uh ranked number four and it was a big

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,440
deal as far as growth

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,720
uh back in the 2018-2019 year

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,639
and i bring this up because

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,079
out of that open source education we

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
came up the idea of doing an

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,120
international hackathon it's something

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,000
we've actually wanted to do for

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,600
quite some time instead of jumping full

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
force into the international hackathon

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,760
we actually went to

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,720
this other idea which was taking the

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,279
concept of a

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,880
hackathon focused on collaborating and

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
growing open source or the black

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,000
community

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,160
empowering open source uh we came up

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,200
that idea called floss and code

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,200
and flossing code was and still is it's

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
a scalable reproducible hackathon in a

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
box so

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
anybody at github can basically take

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,680
this concept of floss and code

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,360
and take it to their community so it's

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,720
not specifically for the black community

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
it's not specifically for

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,880
the latin community or even just the

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,600
general community at all as a whole

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,680
people can take this concept internally

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,480
and host that event

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,920
on their own and floss if you aren't

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,680
familiar i mean again

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,279
every issue could be someone's first

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,639
issue we actually

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,480
we leveraged this term and the way we

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,880
went to sort of quote unquote market was

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,440
free license open source software

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,120
i realize free as in libre open source

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,120
software is a thing i know that's uh

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
that's the preferred acronym

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,880
um but honestly uh it really doesn't

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,199
matter because what we're really focused

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,000
on

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,440
is actually educating individuals

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,199
specifically black individuals for the

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,199
black cat's sake

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,120
of open source and that's exactly what

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,680
it did so the majority of the

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
room did not even know what floss was um

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,240
they knew of it as the uh

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
the popular dance back in 2019. when i

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,079
when i think about open source i think

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,000
of this

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,920
idea of if you don't got sauce and you

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,519
lost it's a quote actually taken from

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,360
the godfather of trap music which is

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,320
gucci mane uh and this is one of the

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,800
interviews he died

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,399
in back in the late 2000s and it's

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,560
really focused around

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,920
access to information like if you don't

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,519
really know what you're doing

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,120
it's it's hard to know what you're doing

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
and i think that comes in the

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,600
really comes in the the limelight of

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,120
open source when you think about

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,440
how a lot of people just don't know how

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,360
to get started people don't really know

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,720
what to do or i'm in the the existence

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,160
of open source

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,800
but i wanted to point out that this the

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,519
focus for the floss and code event was

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,240
really

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,519
uh we went through the black sororities

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,279
and fraternities

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,399
and we actually reached out to them and

00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,959
said hey we're going to host event in

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,320
atlanta

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,079
would you please come by and we actually

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,959
hosted this in june

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,320
of last year and the real focus was just

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,279
teaching educating

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,959
existing engineers and black students on

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,480
how to do open source

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,399
the focus was actually bringing remotely

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
four different maintainers of different

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,040
projects so this is shelley from the

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,839
electron project

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,760
and also providing support so we had

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,519
nine black decats in the room

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
who are also providing super on the

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,880
ground as well as a group of in the

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,880
github engineers who are providing

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
support through slack channels uh and

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
the focus was hey

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,199
we're gonna teach you about open source

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,560
so we had a

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,320
panel we had some talks and

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,000
we let them know that open source exists

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,079
we let them know through stories

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,920
of different students who got their

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,279
first jobs through open source

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
and leverage those stories so they

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,759
encourage people to do open source on

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,120
the day so

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,199
it was not a hackathon it was actually

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,079
more of a hack day and the goal with the

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,199
goal being

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,440
everybody's going to have their first

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,639
contribution open source today

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,399
local also i wanted to point out that

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,000
this was all based in east elena i

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,839
didn't actually draw that correlation

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
east atlanta east atlanta is actually

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,639
predominantly black

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,680
as well as um yeah it's a predominantly

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
black neighborhood

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,519
uh it definitely has some of the more

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,839
poor residents in the area

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,120
as well and that was one of our focus

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,399
too as well we wanted to not

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,680
focus on the underserved area uh just

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,839
generally like the inner city

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,839
we want to actually focus on the

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,240
underserved area just generally in the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,880
city

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,519
uh when i attend atlanta events or

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,759
conferences

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,199
i don't usually attend them in atlanta i

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,959
always end up attending them

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,720
uh for tech conferences outside of

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,920
atlanta instead of the suburbs so i

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
bring this up because one of the

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,680
the local residents who was an uber

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,680
driver actually shared

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,120
um that he'd never seen anything like

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,560
this he had been a part of atlanta

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,199
communities and a lot of

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,720
tech events as well um but what would

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,160
blew him away is that we were actually

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,320
shipping code and we were actually

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,880
learning tangible things to the point

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,720
where

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,160
he actually stuck around for like a good

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,720
hour um after

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,240
even once his his ride was complete um

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
he actually stuck around

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
learned about open source uh and

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
actually we exchanged

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,600
contact information as well uh which is

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,079
super appreciative that

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,880
even someone who wasn't traditionally an

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,039
engineer

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,559
um was able to get value out of the

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,559
event as well

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,640
i also wanted to point out that we also

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,919
had represented representatives from the

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,600
county commissioners as well as the

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
state representatives come through

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,839
talk to the event talk to the attendees

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,679
around the the value of having the

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,480
technical skills as engineers and to

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
pursue their

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,240
education as well and complete that

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,720
again the majority of the the

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,720
individual to room were attendees of

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,160
historically black colleges we wanted to

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,640
give that sort of

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
kickstart or ramp up into educating them

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,559
around

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,559
the idea of open source altogether we

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,280
had 75 attendees one uber driver

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,559
uh 47 opened issues 17 documentation

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,360
pr's four blog posts

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,080
and two tech prs merged from this event

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,880
alone

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,240
uh it was quite the success if we had

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,600
one pr opened

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,360
would have been a success but i think we

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
overexceeded our expectations

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,360
around having black engineers learn open

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,559
source

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,440
we could not done this without the

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,280
partnership of ohub opportunity hub

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,640
and they basically had gave us a

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,440
connection to our dj

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,799
as well if you did not notice in the

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,160
background we do have a dj in the

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,960
background so the entire time the event

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,200
we had a dj

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,640
playing we had an after party as well

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,640
and then we had a food trucks

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,679
as well just to celebrate the fact that

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,120
open source exists

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,880
celebrate the fact that we just learned

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,880
and did something um

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,400
pretty awesome i also want to point out

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,400
that we ended up shipping the

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
the nigeria hackathon 2. based on this

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
concept that we actually learned through

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,000
atlanta we were able to ship that same

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
experience

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,679
in nigeria and lagos which i'm super

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,799
appreciative that we were able to do

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,320
that as well

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,320
so i just wanted to reiterate that this

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,640
is about access and information

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,160
at a time where information about open

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
source is not freely distributed i think

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,760
that we have lots of information

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
out there i think if you googled enough

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,559
you can actually find it

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,320
but i think what we need to do is

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,440
actually let people know that this

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
accent this

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,360
information is free access to open

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,360
source is free but also access to

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,400
improving your resume improving your

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,280
your

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,120
viability of getting jobs is also

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,760
available to you

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,720
uh i always i like this quote about um

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,760
from mlk

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,799
around i believe we ought to do all we

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,640
can and seek lift

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,160
ourselves by our own bootstraps but it's

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,000
a cruel just to say that a boo

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,440
to a bootless man that he ought to lift

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,520
himself by his bootstraps

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,480
and like i think this really this cruel

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,080
gesture this this idea around like hey

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,160
you have the information just go and do

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,360
it or i'm going to walk into

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,440
an open source project and this

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,919
contribute day one like i think that's

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,600
sort of

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,760
naive and i think that sort of puts a

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,760
lot of uh it sort of perpetuates this

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,200
sort of injustice and the the lack of

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,360
information sharing that we

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,520
we have as a community a tech community

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,280
and i just want to just call out and say

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,960
like the the path in the open source

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,320
is a little bit broken i think it sort

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,480
of leans on

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,679
individuals who have the time have the

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,600
capital have the

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,799
the experience to be able to jump in

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,200
there and do something

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,880
uh and it also leans on a lot of like

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
expectation that you should already know

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,080
about something like this so i think

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,600
there's always going to be opportunity

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,080
for us to continue to teach

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,039
and grow communities and then we can we

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,159
don't have to actually

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:21,520
rely on hey looking for pipelines or

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,559
are trying to leverage um existing

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,400
communities

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,760
um if you're looking for black engineers

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,240
you're looking for female engineers if

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,520
you're looking for latin engineers

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,159
we should already be working on that

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,039
that's sort of into the funnel

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,480
the path of open source i also talk

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,000
about this this term intentional

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,440
gatekeeping like

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,440
if we're not doing everything we can to

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,000
make things easy and approachable

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,120
for individuals to do open source uh

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
we're we're

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,320
we're creating a gate for people to

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,120
actually get involved

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,880
and i i'm very i'm very adamant about

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,640
saying it even internally at github is

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,559
saying they're still missing parts

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,320
to getting involved in open source like

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,360
github is truly at a place to discover

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
open source

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,159
um why is it that every time i go to i

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,200
need to i go to contribute to a project

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,720
i don't know where to start um and

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,240
there are some really good information

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,159
out there that's available to

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,480
anybody who wants it which is open

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,000
source guide uh part of

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
four members of my team who have moved

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,640
on to do other things within a github

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,960
like get up sponsors

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,679
um started this thing called open source

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,600
guide which is

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,640
a lot of free information to starting

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
your own open source project

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,360
contributing

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,200
understanding licenses all the

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,120
information is out there

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,280
good first issue it's like another good

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,120
project is a good idea too as well

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,720
uh and it's a way to label your issues

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,559
for people to know

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,320
coatrio is another project that i've

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,679
known since i've been an engineer i knew

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480
about this before i even got in the open

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,960
source

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,039
of a way to get issues delivered to you

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,880
by email every morning

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,039
and it's like a really good way for you

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,080
to not no longer struggle

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,280
through understanding like what is there

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,120
to get started

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,880
but i would say this last three three

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,760
slides we're really about

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,120
the information being there but i think

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,720
there's still a broken piece

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,200
where we don't know what to do with that

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,880
information just because it's there

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,240
so i personally i built a project called

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,240
open source

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,360
open source and it's an open source

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,559
project to manage your open source

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,799
contributions

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,919
uh i built this back in 2016 the end of

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,320
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,679
and it was really focused around me to

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,720
saving repositories

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,080
and taking notes on the discover later i

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,559
really built this

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,559
project out of actually i built floss

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,159
and code out of the idea of this project

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,039
because i knew there was a imbalance

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,799
of information and i wanted to mirror

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,559
these all these ideas into

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,840
basically building a flossing code that

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
i could have like literally every

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,720
weekend

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,159
with myself where i can learn about open

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,200
source talk to maintainers

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,320
and contribute back uh one more note

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,799
that i just want to mention

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,799
the idea of mentorship is great but i

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,240
think sponsorship is always going to be

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,679
a step above and there's an obvious

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,120
feature that github has which is called

00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,679
github sponsors you might not have heard

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,960
of it but

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,440
just know that it exists i personally

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,280
have been

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,640
borderline depressed i don't know if i

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,520
can openly say i was depressed in the

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,120
last couple weeks

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,600
just being a black male and seeing

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,480
everything that's happened in society

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,280
it's been quite hard to watch and i say

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,799
that because

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,440
a couple weekends ago i just basically

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,760
was just

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,720
sort of fed up on this my involvement in

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,720
open source and

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,480
knowing that i'd done stuff like floss

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,240
and code i wanted to give back continue

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,360
to give back to my community

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,520
and it went so well that i had i think

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,360
roughly around 14 people respond

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,480
and i sponsored all of them because i

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
wanted to give back to the community

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,440
that i come from i want to give back to

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,559
the community that maybe i didn't even

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,320
grow up in

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,320
there's engineers from uk's and

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,440
engineers from africa

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,080
engineers from um huntsville

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,279
alabama i wanted to give back to this

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,640
community because i feel like

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,320
valuing and sponsoring their career um

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,400
and their involvement in open source is

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
only going to help the situation down

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,240
the road so when we start talking about

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,840
getting black individuals on board seats

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
and black individuals maintaining and

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,480
working as

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,760
engineers at company like we don't have

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
to have that conversation five years

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,120
from now because i think if we continue

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
to look at the community that needs the

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,600
most help

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,600
or communities that would like to

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,240
advance themselves into open source

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,720
like we should just do it and i feel

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
like

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,240
sponsoring is a way i can i can help and

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,440
i can invest in this community and i'm

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,799
not this is not a call out for everybody

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,760
else to do this it's just me sharing my

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,480
story

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,600
um and sharing monica's story monica

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,240
she's been involved in

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,919
react ladies pretty early on actually

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,600
sort of got it off the ground

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,360
and doing some really awesome stuff and

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,000
doing some teaching on egghead

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,400
and i found monica of roughly a month

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,880
ago

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
and i've did the call out and monica

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,720
responded

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,400
and now we have 49 sponsors actually

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,360
sponsoring monica and i think

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,279
her career will now be directly impacted

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,880
uh because of this event that sort of i

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:59,039
just threw out there and i think

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,559
uh this idea is like really

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,480
not about the money i don't github

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,240
sponsors it is about you know

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,520
giving money to engineers but i think

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,799
it's really more about the access the

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,320
access information

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,120
uh because i think what we really need

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,880
to do is in this sort of unintentional

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,039
gatekeeping i know this is not

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,400
intentional for people to say hey you're

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,919
not allowed to do open source or hey

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,120
there's not a path for you in the open

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,120
source today

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,159
i think we could end that and literally

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,919
to start investing

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,279
in in communities start investing in

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,799
people

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,640
and i would really encourage you let's

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,080
start freely giving access to open

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
source if there is somebody with

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,480
questions

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,039
take the time to respond to them even if

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,880
it's in the wrong form if it's the email

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,039
that's fine push them back into the

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,320
issues or the stack overflow

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,440
but follow through and if especially if

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,000
you have the time if you don't have the

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,159
time

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,520
consider stop doing open source because

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,200
i honestly think that

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,039
open source really needs to be inviting

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,400
and it needs to have to be a pathway

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,320
for more and more contributions for

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,000
people who don't look like us so thank

00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:11,840
you very much my name's speedwell

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:11,840
on twitter and i'm also bdugie on github

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,679
