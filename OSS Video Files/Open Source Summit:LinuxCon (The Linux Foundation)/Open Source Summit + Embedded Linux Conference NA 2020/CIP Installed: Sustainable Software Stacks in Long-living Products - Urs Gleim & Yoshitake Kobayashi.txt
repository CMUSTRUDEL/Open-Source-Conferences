okay welcome everybody so we are pleased

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,880
to have you here

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,679
so uh our talk is called

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,400
cip install sustainable software stacks

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,160
and

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,160
long living products cip stands for

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,439
civil infrastructure platform and in

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
this talk you

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,119
will learn what this is what the purpose

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,279
of this is

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,160
who's contributing how you can

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,560
contribute

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,519
and first of all let us introduce

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,840
ourselves

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,840
so maybe yoshi will start

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,960
hi i'm yusi from koshiba and also

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,120
cip and i'm work i'm working at the cip

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,000
as a technical student committee chair

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,239
and

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,480
to discussing more technical directions

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,360
about that

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,360
thank you for coming

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,120
thanks joshie we are doing this talk

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,239
together so i'm

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,360
first line with uh siemens

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:11,280
and um we are

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,760
just about to get started now

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
so uh civil infrastructure and industry

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,280
trends

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,040
so what is coming and what is upcoming

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,640
and surprise

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,240
uh it's a lot about internet of things

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,520
iot

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
and you all see or we all see around us

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,520
a lot of

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,479
devices get connected like cars for

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,799
example

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,920
not just uploading data but also

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,759
uploading

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,040
or exchanging information with servers

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,520
in order to enable

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,960
new business business models and uh like

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,399
like car

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,479
sharing uh apps and things like that

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,439
but also in industry in the city area

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,439
there are a lot of

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,759
systems which get connected at the

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,799
moment to enable

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,920
also we are just gathering

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,520
data to do predictive maintenance to do

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,119
better quality inspection

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,560
uh optimizations regarding production

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,599
and so on

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
and uh the same is true for for smart

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,640
cities so there are

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,160
a lot of hidden systems in the city

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,280
which get connected

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,440
to gather data about power consumption

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,400
and even and and traffic flow and so on

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,360
and get more and more connected to each

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
other

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,840
and uh data is matched uh

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,160
energy function weather forecasts and

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,599
everything

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,560
uh but the special thing compared to

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,480
maybe these typical handwriting devices

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,080
we all know

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,440
is that there are still these

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,599
old systems behind ensuring

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,840
the normal operation of the whole

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,560
infrastructure like uh

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
controlling the trains on the rails uh

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
like uh

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,239
also smaller systems like ticket gates

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,360
all the hundreds of system

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,480
managing power grids for example are in

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,959
the power plants

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,400
controlling turbines and similar devices

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,519
and many more so building automation is

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,959
controlling light

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,480
uh the fire safety products

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,720
uh there is always telecommunication

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,120
equipment which uh which helps us to

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,159
also do these broadcasts here

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,640
um which is is running in the background

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,760
and we highly rely on the systems not

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,239
the

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,799
healthcare and i already mentioned it

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
also

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,080
to the industry so this is a smaller

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
domain or an

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
affecting area everybody but there are a

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
lot of

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
automation systems uh helping to run the

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,159
production

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,159
and at the precision we needed and the

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,519
efficiency we

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,239
needed and when talking about iot the

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,200
question is

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,439
um what's so special about all the these

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,439
systems and why does it need

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,680
why do we have the need for a project uh

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,920
created uh in this area

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,680
area so if you look at classical

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,160
consumer iot devices so

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,400
it looks basically like this you have

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,000
light bulbs or other devices

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,080
tvs connected to a central server

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
and if you look if you compare this to

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,880
systems

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
installed in infrastructure systems and

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,880
industry

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,479
yeah you see this immediately it's much

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,960
more complicated

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,720
uh there are more systems involved

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,680
interacting with each other

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,360
and we have what we call these

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,280
industrial great

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,560
uh requirements like uh robust

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,400
24 7 operation and uh

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,080
even operation if certain things do not

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,000
work like the the connection to the

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,320
cloud for example so if

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,639
you use your smartphone it does not

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,680
it matters too much so it's maybe

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,520
annoying but

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,880
it does not affect anybody else

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,360
in the in brighter case uh what we have

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,240
is we really have to ensure that all

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,440
these systems

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,840
i mentioned are constantly working

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,199
and also another topic is the bottom

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,759
line guaranteed latency throughput and

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,000
repo

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,600
responsiveness that's because of these

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
systems are interacting with the

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
physical

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,759
world so you really are interacting with

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,039
physical processes with real traffic

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,880
and so on so um we

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,639
really have to guarantee times here we

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,639
are talking about real-time

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,400
systems and this in total is what we

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,919
call

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,720
industrial grade systems in addition to

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,400
this

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,639
um one other

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,680
speciality if you want of these systems

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
is that they live

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,400
quite long so if you look at some

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,120
control systems

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,639
they look somehow like what you see on

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
that slide so they are really

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,400
old and that also means the systems we

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
built today

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,160
will stay there for a while and we

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,199
somehow have to

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,479
ensure that the system can work such

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,400
such a long time and all this together

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,840
we are living in a connected world that

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,880
opens up

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,440
much more possibilities of cyber attacks

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,440
so

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,639
security is also the big question how to

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,360
ensure this

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:45,199
and we really have a lot of devices

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,199
and at the moment we have a lot of

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
devices which are

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,000
yeah have different we

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,039
had to have different computer or

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
software architectures

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:09,120
uh in okay okay

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,759
let's go to the next slide uh so this

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
summarizes basically what are the

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,720
challenges

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,759
um so we talked about industrial grade

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,639
systems real

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,639
reliability some sometimes functional

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,800
safety

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:30,240
uh and uh real-time

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,680
capabilities and um

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,280
then we have to build sustainable

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,960
software stacks so

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,400
systems are living for for decades not

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,360
for years we have to ensure backwards

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,680
compatibility

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,520
and i i'm just getting the message that

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,639
the audio is quite bad

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:59,840
so maybe we will try to

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,840
to switch to the phone just a second

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,800
oh sorry um this is

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:18,720
talking uh the audio is not working well

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,199
so we need to switch from pc to

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:27,840
phone so please wait a moment sorry

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,840
about that

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,760
so um

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,600
okay so

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,600
it should be better now can you hear me

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,399
yeah i can hear you thank you very much

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,000
for waiting

00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,200
okay so this slide summarizes what

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,399
i was talking about so uh our

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,480
systems which are uh part of

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,519
civil infrastructure which are part of

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,279
industry

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,040
have to be industrial grades in the

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
sense that they have to be reliable

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,279
sometimes we have functional safety

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,240
requirements

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,480
they very often need to fulfill

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,519
real-time capabilities

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,959
these systems live for a long time like

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,959
uh decades not years uh

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,839
we have a need a strategy how to

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,560
exchange things so this backwards

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,760
compensability

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
and uh security-wise uh yes we have also

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,440
to

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
consider how do we ensure security over

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
the years

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,880
that means uh security value

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,480
vulnerability management this

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,600
means we need a robust software update

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,240
concept

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,160
and of course behind that we have to

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,040
ensure that there are no regressions

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,760
in the system and how do we solve these

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,440
challenges

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,880
so uh systems become more complex

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,920
and one thing is

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,800
that a development which we see on this

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,079
slide

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,200
which is true for for the whole i.t

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,440
world that we build more and more

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
and so-called on so-called commodity

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,839
components which

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,959
are open source mostly and this

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,760
proprietary differentiating part gets

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,360
percentage-wise smaller and smaller in

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,880
those systems

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,720
and that's why

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,079
we also said why don't we also team up

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,279
for these domains so for people who

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,000
build

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,720
systems which which have a long lifetime

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,839
and have these industrial requirements

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,600
and then start to

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,760
uh start to to develop a strategy on

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
this and not only a strategy but also

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,320
really

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,760
developing uh software will come to this

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,680
so uh one part of this

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,480
is um that

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,040
at the moment we noticed or a couple of

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
years

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,320
ago we noticed that we even in these big

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,760
companies like toshiba

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,519
hitachi siemens and and others

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
we have a lot of different software

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,000
stacks around which

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,399
all have to be maintained and so

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,120
there was a strong demand for a

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
harmonization to agree on

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,600
starting with the linux kernel to to

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,160
agree on the same kernel to agree on the

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,839
same packages used the same sources

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,560
the same infrastructure and so forth

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,120
that's why we created this project which

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
is called

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,240
civil infrastructure platform and

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,120
this basically consists of

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,880
parts which are the foundation for

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,800
industrial

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:04,000
linux distribution so and since we

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,200
started small and had a few partners we

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,760
started with the

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,320
kernel which was the most pressing

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,920
demand

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,040
at that time and said okay let's team up

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
for the kernel

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,200
and extend the existing long-term

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,040
support initiatives

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,600
uh up to 10 years maybe more but that's

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,639
something we we thought we could commit

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
on

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,240
and then and this is happening now

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,519
extend this

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,480
by the packages which everybody needs

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,040
so for very small systems they can be

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,200
pretty sure that this is in

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,880
and so we are continuously

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,880
extending extending this sorry

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,079
so how does is this used then in the

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,600
company so

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,240
um we take the lower parts out of this

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
project out of the civil infrastructure

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,360
and then

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,560
we have a layered approach and put

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,000
domain specific

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:06,399
extensions on on top most of them are

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,279
then coming from from

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,399
from the debian releases in this case so

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,360
they are not

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,480
part in the upper areas of the cip

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
project

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,160
so the maintenance and the development

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
of these packages is then in the

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,920
responsibility of the respective

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,160
units of the companies but at least

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,440
we have a common base and we are

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,519
continuously

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,160
extending this and yeah the next slide

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,360
basically

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,079
shows uh the same so we of course

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,120
use what is there in terms of long-term

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,199
support

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,839
so the debian long-term support and

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,760
extended long-term support programs

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:53,519
and this together then results in a

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,800
sustainable maintainable way of

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,440
or base for

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,120
for distributions and a lot of people

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,079
were asking us why are you doing this

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,320
why i'm not just jumping to the next

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,680
to the latest kernel version the reason

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
is

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,040
that there are a lot of restrictions

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,560
behind

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,680
their certification for example

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,120
and switching the operating system so

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,160
switching the kernel and

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
packages above to a newer version would

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,000
mean insis

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,800
these systems running the complete test

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,360
process

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,600
uh up to the system test doing the

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,959
certification again

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,120
and uh this is really a lot of work

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:42,000
which is uh which we try to avoid

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,320
so in many cases it's easier to backport

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,720
security patches for example

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,680
it's less work and if if we share this

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,519
work like we do in this program

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,800
it's it's even less compared to

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,120
doing this alone so the setup of the

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,760
project is

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,680
the setup of the project is is like this

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,399
so how does this work we have several

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,240
companies

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,320
so this is renaissance siemens toshiba

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
code thing cybertrust hitachi moxon

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,800
platoon at the moment

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,000
who teamed up and these companies

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,440
provide two things

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,800
basically so this is uh their own people

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,199
this is developers and maintainers

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,279
on one side and this is budget on on the

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,040
other side and

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,320
there is an error between budget and

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,240
developers

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,120
this should mean that we can extend our

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,000
team of developers and maintainers by

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,199
using

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,199
some of the budget to to hire additional

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,079
people

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,759
from the kernel community or from

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,399
different projects

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,519
or just people who are good at what they

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,720
are doing

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,639
and so we have a common budget we do a

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,839
cost sharing on the things which we want

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,079
to drive

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
this is developers and there's an error

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,759
down

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,800
uh this means we are also funding

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,920
projects which

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,040
are important for us like if we have

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,639
requirements

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,759
uh which we wanted to place in debian

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,560
packages or in

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,160
we want to push also some real-time

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,120
linux efforts

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,920
we are also funding certain tasks in

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,480
these

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:31,440
respective projects and uh

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,920
the policy or the strategy here always

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,079
is

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,079
we we don't want to create something on

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,519
our own so the policy is

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,240
upstream first so we are always working

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,519
together

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,639
with the upstream projects we are using

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,839
whatever is

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,160
there and we we are trying to push back

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,480
all the changes we need

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:58,000
to to the upstream projects

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,880
so with this i would like then to switch

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
over to yoshi who goes a little bit into

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,959
the detail

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,959
of of the the actual work of the project

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,559
and the progress

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,720
of the last year all right thank you

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,919
very much

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,880
so uh from now on i directed something

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,760
about

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
current latest data subject for cip

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,319
projects

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,640
so crp is uh arranged

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:31,280
to solve our key issues

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,480
um state relax

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:38,240
and also reliable and so on

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,520
so they currently um have a lot of

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,120
issues um as you can see in this slide

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,799
there are a lot of bugs but some of them

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,080
is only clouded

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,760
so we're currently focusing on the six

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,799
activities and this uh first one

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,559
is a super long time support then we

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,640
expand our activity to

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:06,880
real time and testing and so on

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,919
so the reason why we

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,960
expand our activity step by step

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,400
is we prioritize for

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,679
each director topics

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,480
uh from the request of our customer

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,720
requirements

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,000
and also our actual requirements for

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,000
civil infrastructure

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,400
so

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,440
yeah so this is a

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,720
city governing structure and the project

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,240
market so each project

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,919
focusing on the scopes for

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,960
cip current workforce so every

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,480
uh cip activities it is on

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,039
to ensure uh industrial grade

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,280
for uh civil infrastructure and critical

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,919
infrastructure systems

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,840
and some of them are focusing on the

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,400
sustainability for example

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:09,600
uh city core and things

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,520
just a lot on the cfd colony and cfd

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,580
core itself

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,120
to expect its uh stabilities for the

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,240
[Music]

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,440
infrastructure systems so this

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,880
kind of works on from

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,960
our technical experience and also each

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:34,559
working groups working on the specific

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,559
topics to ensure its goals

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:43,200
so as well said we have a

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,240
strong absolute cost policy

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,760
so crp you know as you can see in chevy

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,280
project

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,720
there they also have many projects

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,320
already learning to solve their uh

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,840
goals for example our cip

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,960
needs to real-time future to use linux

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,080
in the industrial controlling systems

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,120
but lesson leaders project has already

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,679
exist

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,000
so that means this ambiguous project is

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,679
upstream for us

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,840
cfp tried to contribute this kind of

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,919
machine project

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,679
first to

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:29,600
to involve its goals

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:34,159
and then i used the swim called results

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,159
in the cbd processor platform project

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,760
for our use cases and that

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,760
is the result of cid open source space

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,600
area

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,840
so in the left side corner

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,960
there are many contributed projects by

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,480
cipa

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,560
but we also have other interest projects

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,919
like software data

00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,880
[Music]

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,280
hypervisor or something like that so

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
this

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,440
kind of innovative projects currently

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,400
are considering

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,600
to use by cip members for the future

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,720
candidates

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
in the cme base layer so this is a

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,440
structure how we

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,799
work with upstream community and also

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,080
to create open source space area

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,360
so this circle is

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,400
most important for us

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,520
to create our open source space layer

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,000
for industry systems

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,000
so let me describe more details for the

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,200
each working groups

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,240
and from now on so this side

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
so she i need super long-term support

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,480
called

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,360
development so we have a cip current

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,720
team

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,919
uh in the cip project and

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,600
the project mentoring by beijing he is

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,799
also

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:07,200
working on a debian account adventure

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,200
and also county uh works for the

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,840
stable releases so he mentors

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,760
our mentor is a experienced college

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,039
developer

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,240
but we also like to have

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:36,080
more experience from

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,120
experienced stable mentors so that's why

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,640
we have this structure environmental and

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,240
majors

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,440
and under the mentor on antenna

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,240
we have a couple of developers to

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,360
maintain

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,280
and to review the cfd corner and

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,559
purchase

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,679
rivers is upstream corner so our

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,960
stream is mainline also uh several

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,919
releases

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,360
so currently uh there are six several

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,400
releases when you

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,440
see the current code site

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,240
and we picked up the serial killer

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,679
versions

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,600
for safer long-term support so

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:23,039
our first one is version 4.19

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,320
where we currently maintain

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,200
the latest versions and 4.4

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,799
is our first year is the super long-term

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,080
support career

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,360
so to create some support

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:41,120
we first pick up the

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,720
kids color then we start

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,000
work with long-term stable teams

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,520
so that means

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,960
we also review the punches and

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,240
also post the review results

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,240
to uh the stable

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:06,880
waiting list so this is how we work

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,880
together with a stable current game

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,039
and the next slide should also cause

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,360
related topics uh vietnamese

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,279
scholarly development is also uh

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,520
currently ongoing

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:24,720
um but unfortunately earlier to me

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,720
match is not may 9th yet

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:32,720
so we address the activities to mainline

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:36,000
our main idea from next column

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,200
because uh currently uh the same

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
color patch is separated with a

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,559
mainline column that means if we want to

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,640
use

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:52,480
a stable column which is very

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:56,799
we need to create a stable rd color

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,880
so let's mix twice

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,279
which is that we need to maintain stable

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,590
corner cornea and stability color

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,760
so when this color

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,679
[Music]

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,960
is masked we also directly contribute to

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,559
the

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,840
stable study stable project

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,799
so that makes much easier for not just

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,840
only uh

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,960
any expert users but also our

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,400
use cases so this is why

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,159
we usually contribute to the data media

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,720
scholarly project

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,840
and after uh we joined the director of

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,679
iraq's project

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,840
uh there are a lot of progress

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,400
so we are looking forward to mainland

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,080
earlier

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,000
current purchase so

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,360
and this is a current version from

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,480
project city url

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,919
so our first uh cfd current

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,279
is a 4.4 and that is released

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,960
on 2017

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:06,320
november on november 2017

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,559
january so this is our very first year

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,559
and it's about three years from now

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,279
[Music]

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,640
uh and the

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,159
next one is focus 19 that was released

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,600
uh one year

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:38,559
and a half years ago and project the os

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:42,159
is on 2029

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,880
so so um

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,279
maybe uh some uh i think it's also good

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,159
to

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,240
know uh what is the next call invoicing

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,480
so we're currently running to

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,480
check

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:12,159
next one so

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:16,400
this is called developing statistics

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:20,799
um so in total uh cf24.1 corner

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:24,480
is a releasable 45

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:28,000
times and yet um

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,880
it's released 29.5 times so we

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,080
are currently released almost

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,970
periodically

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,069
but um after a few years later we

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,069
[Music]

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,799
changed the release video

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,799
because it's

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,840
stability from the

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,679
what we are doing

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,600
under the next phrase shows that crp

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,919
core cp4

00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,679
is user mostly focusing on the user

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,279
related programmers

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,360
and our goal for crp core is provide a

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,440
reference implementation with cfpco

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,559
packages

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,559
and currently we have two one for tiny

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,760
and totally used for small iot devices

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,799
and controlling currencies the other one

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,799
for them

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,840
that is for a much richer environment

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,159
something that i will be gathering and

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:39,039
the currently

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:42,799
both intentional is available on the

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,799
website when you go to

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,120
you gpro.com find both crp calling

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,320
so we are we are using

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,050
debian to create a csv core

00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,170
on this area and that is

00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,170
[Music]

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:18,320
to create our best ratio

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,159
so this structure is uh we are working

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,679
on

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,880
and so the testing is um

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,640
yeah she provides this environment to

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,320
test achieve the higher rp core packages

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,200
so um currently uh we invoke a

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,080
distributed testing environment on aws

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
with java

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:45,120
and rsi

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,840
and this is the structure for the gfd

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,320
so we have two profiles who share the

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,679
core

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,679
and each uh cfd core profiles create the

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,720
root card systems

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,720
by using uh

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,440
the corner and also other departments

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,880
and when we create each uh proper glute

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,640
file system

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,919
we learnt on the labor environment

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,520
on uh cfd device hardware

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:20,720
so that is controlled by lava uh

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:24,960
ews and the results are also going to

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:36,240
give you to show the current ci um

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:39,520
i'm foreign

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,440
to uh ci projects

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:48,840
to to improve

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,960
their activities so to make a more

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,840
stable

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,840
our victory here

00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:01,519
so um in asia we currently

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,720
have uh six seven

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,760
reference board and one um sports

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,279
candidate

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,320
on that so each uh transport

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,200
and speeds are shear dslts

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,000
but um some of those i only support are

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,720
the latest cips that yes

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,960
that's because uh the old account

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,000
doesn't support newer hardware

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,600
so we we are currently trying to

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,600
increase our different sport

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,320
to make more stable

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,679
and also more useful

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,600
colors so that's the principles i

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,440
decided by a cfd different

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,399
standing committee so if you drive to

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,559
uh increase for our reference board

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,919
please talk with us

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:57,120
so this is the kind of a way

00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:01,039
to involve

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,240
this project

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:08,000
and this one is security working group

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,799
so security is one of the most important

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,080
topic

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,600
nowadays because in iot and industrial

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,399
iot

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:21,440
uh devices connected to your network

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,559
to provide their functionalities

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,559
which means also that kind of

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:32,640
devices there's some security disks

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,120
so in security working group course

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,919
at the beginning we address the provider

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,679
guidelines and different implementations

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:44,399
to ensure

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,760
standard requirement so currently we

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,880
focusing on the

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,880
uh iec 2643

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:56,080
industry standard and

00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:00,080
in our activities so

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:04,399
as you can see the nice sidewalks

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:07,519
and also yellow uh building boxes

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,799
so we just implemented test cases

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,799
to ensure this kind

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,640
in the schedule for iec 264.3 as with

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,840
this requirement

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,120
and our current latest status

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,039
is the new drug

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,440
to have a gap assessment with fabulous

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,320
certification body because that's how

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,210
somebody

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,559
uh certified

00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:50,080
[Music]

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,600
the college degree to ensure

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:57,039
other cyber standard so

00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,159
without a certification body assessment

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:03,840
we can't see anything this is uh such

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:07,840
almost certified or not so

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,840
we just started

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,480
cyber security assessment with uh

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,679
transparency somebody so

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,560
that is very interesting and we look

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,839
forward

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,839
for this result

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,639
and the last one is a software update

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,839
so our goal is for the updates

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,119
to cooperate common solutions also

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,040
update foreign core so nowadays many

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,800
devices connected to the network

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,079
and we have to manage all of them and

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:47,760
we just use our specific

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,960
solutions but i'll be interacting

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,320
create more direct solutions for our

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,839
industrial use cases

00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,320
so currently uh we use sw update

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,320
for the

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,560
based updating systems and the data

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,000
business system is currently controlling

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,640
it's a home

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
so we currently create our joint

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,760
implementations by using both

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,280
uh process tax

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,720
and uh this is a safe update over here

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,800
so yeah this is a bit complicated

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,760
but then yeah this is our latest

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,280
thoughts

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,560
so um yeah when you

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,320
use this recount you can

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,680
make sure the uh the consistent

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,119
image is exactly the same as

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:49,119
we expected and also that is

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,240
security loaded and also installed

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,520
so this is an important feature for

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,520
industry use cases

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,839
so all implementation is available on

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,119
the website

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:08,480
and you can also find our status update

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,760
in cfp cursor wiki

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,520
and currently our implemented uh

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,920
different implementations but

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,200
um this is still our number four

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,400
quarterback

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,119
so our future plan is we address input

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,839
required

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,839
code for more stable and flexible

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
implementations

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:47,440
all our tip is allocated to ensure

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,920
the secret uh suspect area

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,720
and also collaboration is our most

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,760
important

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,119
aspect to realize our open source

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,119
platform

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,320
well thank you very much and let me i'll

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,960
change to

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,960
us who are concluding this talk

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,359
i know i needed to unmute sorry

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,880
um yes so um

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:22,400
as we said i think we motivated uh why

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,000
uh so-called open source base layer how

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,280
we call it for industrial

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,960
grade software is is really needed

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,520
and i think we are doing this the right

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,119
way

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:40,720
so there are several big companies um

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:44,079
which which teamed up and create

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:48,079
this so it's big companies all

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,160
of them have in common somehow to have

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,160
products which are long living which are

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,200
living in industry environments which

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,920
are living in

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,680
city and traffic and and so on

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,280
requirements

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,920
and um also

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,800
with renaissance we have a semiconductor

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,920
on board

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,320
and they are providing their their

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,320
boards

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:16,800
with cip support

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,480
out of the box and we saw this in the

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,800
test setup on your

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,000
slide slide we have four test labs

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
running up and running

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,320
ensuring that there's no regression and

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,119
i think the way to success is here to

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,920
not build

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,760
new things so to team also up with the

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,680
other open source projects to work

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,720
upstream

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,400
and it also helps to to

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:48,720
harmonize the tool changed

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:52,240
and to also work on this to improve

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:56,000
the tool chains to build uh linux based

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,960
embedded systems and uh to to ensure the

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,800
quality of the releases at the

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,760
at the end so that's basically

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,320
the main conclusion um again we have a

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,599
slide

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,079
uh showing all the

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,880
um showing all the companies who are at

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,240
the moment

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,359
actually contributing and we

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,400
of course hope to

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,480
to get others on board so be it

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,800
from the industry space from the

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,960
infrastructure space

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:34,640
or from the from the semiconductor area

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,839
and i think

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,359
this will get more important

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,000
in the future and uh especially also in

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,680
times like

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,680
this we see how important these

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,599
infrastructure is for us

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,400
and that's important to have a

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,599
sustainable not only hardware but also

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,150
software

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,680
supporting this

00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,320
[Music]

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,760
you'll see on that slide we'll upload

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,839
the slides by the way

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,800
to scared.org this was one of the

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,760
questions

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,160
um and there you will find all the links

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,839
so

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,960
feel free to to join the mailing lists

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,280
so

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,319
it's it's it's an open source project so

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,440
everyone

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,480
can can contribute or just

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,800
read it and of course

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,920
there's the website and uh

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,560
yeah the linux foundation entry pages uh

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,960
and uh yoshi already mentioned the wiki

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,119
which is also open to everybody

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,000
and last but not least uh of course

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,079
there are

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,079
git repositories which we refer to

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,720
that's it i think we have a couple of

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,599
minutes left

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:53,839
for questions so um feel free

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:56,319
to ask questions maybe use the

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,040
the the questions panel there are some

00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,319
questions

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:04,839
already so maybe we

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:07,000
we start uh with the first one which i

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,359
found

00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,480
[Music]

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:15,680
one question is is there a dedicated cip

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:20,400
layer available for yoktor

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,920
maybe yoshi this goes in your direction

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,119
okay um so we currently uh

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,400
use this yogurt other tools

00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,440
um just except to use we currently if

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,319
you are

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,599
other tools are from but i will

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,440
currently uh

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:43,359
use a devious source code

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,720
so which means we don't use

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,359
uh it's actually a your source code

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,359
a reason

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,839
there are no futures for the long-term

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,720
support uh in the usa projects

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,800
but that is why and also has more than

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,319
five years manchester europe

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:10,480
so this is why we actually uh

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,280
live in a source called this is back

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,319
so that is the answer for these

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,359
questions

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,680
so yeah sorry it's not a part of the

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,880
question yes but i'm not exactly

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,880
using yourself itself

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,880
yeah the thing is the commitment about

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,640
the releases

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,400
and and the support and uh

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,280
for us uh yorkto is uh at the moment not

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,760
committed to

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,319
to to have a release plan so it's it's

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,480
uh

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,839
it's done in some cases in some cases

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,040
not and so it's

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,760
uh we are conservative uh and we need

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,079
a long-term plan and so debian is as far

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,440
as

00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:01,119
uh the base which

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,480
which allows us to build the systems

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:07,920
okay then there's a questions on uh

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:12,960
verified and secure boot um

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:15,280
what actually is uh is the plan there

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,280
um

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,319
i'm not sure what is meant uh there's

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,599
uh yeah the the

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,880
the question is uh that should be done

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:35,200
more basically and um maybe

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,400
um we could also refer to the security

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,880
working group they're actually

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,359
discussing what to include into cip and

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,520
whatnot

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,640
regarding the actual question regarding

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,440

important change as well industrial use

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,800
