hey everyone

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,639
back for the back for the big event

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,000
our annuals open source survey that the

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,119
new stack does

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,720
with the linux foundation the to-do

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,520
group here

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,720
i am joined by chris andersek of the

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,760
cncf

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,920
chris here we are again

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,199
how are you hey how's it going sorry got

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
a little audio hiccup

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,320
um good to be here uh happy to have an

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
opportunity to talk about

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,719
our latest uh open source survey uh

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,320
program survey uh results from the tutu

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,120
group

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,559
definitely and these are different times

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
around chris aren't they

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,320
it's a here we are virtually we could

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,559
have been

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,079
uh in austin under other circumstances

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,280
i'm sure that's kind of a happy

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,600
cliche thing to say right now

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,399
definitely i i would have appreciated uh

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
walking to

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
the conference venue uh you know instead

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,240
of not being on airplane but i'm

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,439
thankful that we're uh home and healthy

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,159
and are able to

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,439
uh spread uh you know wonderful ospa

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,280
open source program knowledge

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,840
uh to the world today ospo open source

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
program

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
knowledge yes that is what we're here

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,360
for and i'll just

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
take a minute to talk a little bit about

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,040
the new stack

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,840
the new sec has been doing this research

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,520
with the with chris over the past

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
three years and so we're starting to

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,960
have some baseline

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,920
understanding if you're not familiar

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,759
with us

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
the new stack provides explanation

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
analysis of at scale

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
development deployment and management we

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
primarily

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
serve a readership of developers

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,119
engineers devops and

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,119
i.t professionals we like to think of

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,360
ourselves as a trusted resource

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,560
and we try our best to provide that

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,960
through the explanation

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
analysis that we provide you can go the

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,759
new stack dot io

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,880
for more about us

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,000
now let's get in

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,800
to the data just some basics we

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,680
conducted this survey over the time

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,800
frame of may to june of 2020

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,920
they were solicited through social and

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,440
email lists we had about a thousand

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,480
people responding 672 completed the

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,280
survey

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,440
and 17 responses were excluded what i'd

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,239
like to say is that these numbers are

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,879
are less than we've seen in prior years

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,959
um

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,480
we had uh some um

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,640
challenges in actually getting to the

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,480
1000 number total but

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,080
it does equal 2018 numbers and

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
we've been trying to find some reason

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,640
for that and i

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
i attributed in part i think just to the

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
times we're in and chris i don't know if

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
you have any

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,200
any other thoughts on that yeah i know i

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
i mean i you know the

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,080
our thesis of essentially we would see

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,120
uh a larger survey turn out uh due to

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,959
everyone staying at home

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,800
definitely did not play out i'm assuming

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
just you know with the challenging times

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
everyone's operating in

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,400
um it's it's kind of hard to kind of get

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
everyone's attention on a specific

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,159
thing but overall we still received a

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
lot of responses

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,680
and it's enough responses to try to

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,319
deduce

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
some interesting uh you know uh

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,920
takeaways

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
uh from the results i would say that

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
chris

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,159
is pretty active on the github site and

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,120
that's where actually you can find all

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,959
the data

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
and that's at github.com and you can see

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,400
the link there to do group survey

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,519
so you can go there and see the full

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,000
results and

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:48,879
and slice and dice them as you wish

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,159
so we now are building this baseline

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,319
we're building this a

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,159
capability to see some

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,799
some numbers i remember last year when

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,879
we were in leoncrys and

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
you were saying oh well you know we're

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,840
still a little early here

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
in the data collection we're still

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,640
trying to understand a little bit more

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
about

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,400
what's going on here but i think we're

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,439
starting to see some

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,360
i don't know if you would call it

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
benchmark information but i think it's

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,079
getting closer to that i think you'll

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,680
see it

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
in the numbers that we have there are

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,759
some fluctuations

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,120
um but but number one there's this

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,360
widespread adoption

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,759
you know we are seeing that more than

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
half of the companies out there are

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,440
are saying that they have open source

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,040
programs now they're in various stages

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,960
of development we've seen

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
established programs like vmware for

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,800
instance with with dirk over there dr

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
condole and what he's done and he's

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
really actually

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,080
been able to make a lot of real i think

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
substantive changes to the overall kind

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,479
of vision for vmware and how they are

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
uh changing their views and how they're

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,639
changing their perspectives about open

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,320
source

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,759
they've made a number of acquisitions as

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,080
well and so that

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,440
plays into it and as well i will have to

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,199
mention vmware as a sponsor and they

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,360
were the sponsor of this survey as well

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
the cncf is a sponsor as is the linux

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,479
foundation at the new side

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,320
now i don't know chris is that is that

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,560
would you basically say that now we're

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,560
seeing this summary data

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,520
i mean not quite benchmark what what are

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,600
you still waiting for

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,280
you know i think you know the whole idea

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
of putting this survey together was to

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,240
formalize essentially

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,840
uh some kind of uh

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,440
you know essentially you know

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,520
a lot of companies that we've interact

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,280
with are you know experimenting with

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
open source establishing open source

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
programs and there was never kind of

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
data out there

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,240
on you know uh how large are they what

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,080
are open source programs used for and so

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
the idea was always to kind of

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,960
you know have some kind of thing we

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
could reference as an organization given

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,280
that the 2d group essentially is an

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,880
organization of peers who have built or

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,400
building out open source programs across

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,160
the industry so our idea was always just

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,639
to have concrete data we could point to

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,720
because

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,080
a lot of times when people are kind of

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,759
early in their open source program

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,400
journey whether it's a formal

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,800
ospo or informal they're always like

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
well

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,720
how is it done at potentially another

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
organization how large is there aspa how

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,919
many people should i hire should i just

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,319
have one should we just keep it informal

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,000
and so on so just having more data that

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,400
we kind of share based on the trends of

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,759
what's going on industry is very useful

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
um you know for people as we're trying

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,759
to figure out staffing and also benefits

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,319
given that

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
each ospo tends to have different

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
purposes depending generally how the

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,360
business works so you know

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,440
some ospos are very heavily compliance

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,440
focused because they're shipping

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,880
you know you know millions of devices

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
and software on those devices so they're

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,759
distributing software so compliance

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,680
tends to be a little more paramount

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
are kind of more newer age you know web

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
companies where they're distributing

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
less software and physical devices

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,120
uh it's less of a compliance thing and

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
more of uh you know how do i ensure that

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,599
i get roi

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,599
from software that we're contributing to

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,440
or investing or open sourcing

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
ourselves you know you mentioned vmware

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
as a kind of a example ospo but there's

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,840
other organizations out there like

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,680
spotify

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,599
uh you know google with chris de bona

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
and so on that you know are kind of

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,440
you know more of our web companies focus

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,120
and they're really trying to

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,479
either improve their brand and prove how

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,680
efficient their engineers are developing

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,880
and so on so this is just it really

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,880
provides us

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
a data set every year we can reflect

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,360
upon and say here's how things are

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,599
changing

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
here maybe new industries here were some

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
needs that we kind of focus on and we

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
share everything public that link you

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,560
mentioned earlier everyone every year

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
could open up issues

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,160
on our github repo ask you know ask

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,319
questions modify questions

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
and do whatever they want um and

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
participate with us

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,759
excellent maybe you could tell us a

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,919
little bit about the to do group because

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,840
they actually have had an important role

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,680
in in the development of open source

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,520
program offices

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,039
sure i mean we initially started the

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,960
organization a little over

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,639
five years ago it's been informally

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,280
running for longer than that when

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
essentially

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,080
uh a handful of us that were running

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120
open source programs at the time mostly

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
in the bay area

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,400
uh we had companies you know like

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
twitter which i was there's google

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
facebook dropbox and so on we're sharing

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,919
basically a lot of information of

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
you know how did you deal with this

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,840
problem how did you you know

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,360
what tooling did you do to you know help

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,599
improve

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
you know uh and measure roi for your

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,680
open source project so

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,759
we kind of started informally we

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,039
eventually formalized the organization

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,800
uh and brought it to the linux

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,919
foundation to provide a neutral home you

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,120
know for us and kind of handle all the

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,080
back office stuff and essentially

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,960
decided to

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,560
let's go spread the notion of you know

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
open source program management

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,280
uh to the industry given that it's kind

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,760
of a new new field or new type of job

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,919
you know description why not have a you

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,880
know single body that's responsible for

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,599
stewarding

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,120
you know uh what an ospo is how it runs

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
and sharing practices

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,560
amongst each other and you know it's

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,240
been fairly

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,399
successful we have a great set of guides

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,880
that we produce that you know show how

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,120
you

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
start an open source program to how you

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
potentially retire

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,880
project that you know may not be popular

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,360
anymore how do you

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,040
run your events and so on so um overall

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,040
i think we've done a great job and i

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,680
think we're all firm believers that

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,880
you know if you go back you know 20

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,720
years or so ago

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,760
i think i think it was in in in 1995

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,279
when the first

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,120
um uh chief security officer

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,560
was essentially crowned or created right

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,920
and and they were essentially dealing

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,360
with security issues

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,040
at the time it was very early stage i

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,040
still think we're in the early stages of

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,399
open source program management where

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
more and more companies are going to

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,800
have

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,560
chief open source you know people

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,640
directors of open source and so on and

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,080
that will continue to grow just like

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,680
security grew as a center of competency

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
for for companies open source is going

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,360
to be a necessary center of competency

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
given how much open source

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,519
is being used i mean we saw from heather

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,399
miller's keynote today that it's

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,040
you know all the data shows that 98 of

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,680
software

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,519
you know ship these days has open source

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,800
you know em embedded in it uh for for

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,920
the majority of it so we're only gonna

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,040
continue to that trend so you're gonna

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,959
need open source

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
program offices to help manage that for

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,800
organizations

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,160
yeah and i think that that's reflected i

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,160
think in the funding

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,079
in many ways it is stable now there's

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,120
some caveats to that but let's

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,959
let's get into the more of the details

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,399
of the research and so we're going to

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,839
look at some trends

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
and especially around program office

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,079
adoption

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,839
uh one of the fine one of the things i

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,440
get out of this is that

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,839
you know now that we do have three years

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
of data we are seeing people

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,440
using open source there's no question

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,480
it's a i think

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,160
the median right there mean is about 82

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,240
really if you look in that first in the

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,440
first number so

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,120
that to me that seems like that

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
that that's not going to go down right

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,279
that that number i think is

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
is fairly rec them number is like

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,040
showing that

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
yes you know open source contributions

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,399
are

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,000
seriously important organizations and

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,480
and people are consuming open source

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,839
code

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,079
in products or services yeah no

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,600
def i mean it's interesting where i

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,760
think this number should literally be

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
like 99 percent or 100 it's it's hard

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,880
for me to find

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
any piece of software these days that it

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,839
does not have some open source

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,360
bit associated with it but you know

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
everyone you know there are some

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
industries out there that are

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,640
different and things are closed source

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
but i do expect the consumption number

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,720
to continue

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,240
to kind of increase uh over time uh and

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,240
on the production side

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
as more open sources use eventually more

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,120
companies will contribute

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,040
upstream and you know i think we look at

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
the data we're seeing a small

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,040
uh uptick in that i think one of the

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
goals for the to do group and

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,720
ospos in general is to ensure that

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,839
number kind of continues so we could

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,000
kind of

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,200
ensure that you know uh if you look at

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
the research out there if companies

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,440
contribute to stuff they depend on

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,040
it does help influence uh business

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
results and i think in general that's

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,079
the true key to open source

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,760
sustainability is to ensure

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,200
companies and organizations contribute

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,600
to software that they uh depend on

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,639
so in other in the other kind of

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
questions i looked at

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,880
you know the data about collaborating

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,440
contributing initiating or influencing

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,160
open source project and again it seems

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,519
like we are reaching some

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,440
some um reflection that there's some

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,639
that there's some data the data there

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,839
shows that there isn't

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,680
going to be major aberrations and

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,680
what we think about like for the date

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,120
about collaboration

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,360
um you know for instance

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,240
it's uh it's one of the larger questions

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,480
that marks

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,839
you know how we're thinking about

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,760
participating in open source

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,800
organizations a lot of this too i think

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,720
reflects

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,480
how uh influential the open source

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,200
communities have been that have had a

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,120
higher profile external to open source

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,079
program offices which helps kind of

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
reflect

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,880
on you know the the actual recognition

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,240
of open source and the recognition of

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
open source program offices

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,680
definitely would you

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,040
uh would you add anything to that about

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,200
the uh about the

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,639
collaboration with peer across open

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,519
source projects or foundations i don't

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,079
think that the

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
that the foundation uh the foundations

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,320
have had a part in this i mean we

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,639
we base a lot of our cover on projects

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,000
for instance that we're following

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,920
sources i mean found foundations are

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,959
there basically just to serve behind the

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,360
scenes you know any

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,120
any project or you know thing that gets

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,480
large enough you want a

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,720
neutral entity or a fair you know set of

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,480
rules to collaborate right businesses

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,279
are inherently kind of cutthroat

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,279
and you know compete in in the market

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,040
and if the rules aren't fair for people

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,560
to collaborate on a project

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,399
whether it's something like kubernetes

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,120
which is widely used or something like

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,160
linux

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,440
uh the rules you know companies don't

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,800
don't want to collaborate if the rules

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,839
are fair it's kind of like you know the

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,440
analogy would be

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,120
you know a sports match you know maybe

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,279
you play you know

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,360
uh baseball right and if the roles were

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,240
somehow you know set up in a way where

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,600
one team is able to have more people on

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,519
the field than in other

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
like you know why would you play that

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,560
game right i kind of view foundations in

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
a similar world where they're there to

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,240
kind of really

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,000
enforce fair governance and kind of keep

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,040
kind of the ip clean so companies could

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,680
actually build

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,279
commercial solutions or or safely build

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,480
products on top of things without

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,959
without worrying it

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
the the really cool little bit um you

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,480
know that i kind of

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,079
think here is i'm seeing more and more

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,320
end user companies out there

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,639
contributing open source projects and

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
doing new stuff for example

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,000
a company called spotify which i'm sure

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
many of you you know have used or heard

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,040
of

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,720
uh has developed some really cool

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,920
developer portal technology called

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,680
backstage

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,360
essentially it serves as their in-house

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,800
you know developer portal that hooks up

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,880
all their different tools and

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
they decided to just share it with the

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,600
world so if you go to backstage.io you

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,040
could check it out but

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,959
you know they're essentially a music

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,720
streaming company you know

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,880
but they decided to share what they

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,440
built with everyone to help get others

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,120
improved

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,720
to to improve it because you know it's

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
not in their line of business so

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
what intellectual property really there

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
is related to music streaming

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,880
they're just trying to improve how the

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,839
developers build the software so i think

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,440
you're going to continue

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,760
to see more and more of that trend of

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,920
end users out there you know not

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,240
traditionally vendors contributing more

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,040
uh code out there to collaborate with uh

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,040
peers in the industry

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,160
yeah and i think it's important to to

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
point out it's not

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,680
entirely altruistic either i mean

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,240
they've had to like create their own

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,160
tools

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,399
and many times i mean if you look at the

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,000
history of of open source over the past

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,639
five to ten years a lot of the atscale

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,560
companies

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,399
just couldn't use off-the-shelf tools

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,480
and so they started building projects

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,440
and they needed people who were their

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,440
peers

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,480
to be participating as well so they

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,759
could get some feedback

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,279
from health exactly i mean you look at a

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,040
project like envoy

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,440
that came from lyft right you know

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
lifted scooters and you know

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,920
ride sharing and they were not happy

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,360
with nginx at that time because there

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,560
were certain features that they couldn't

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,560
get out of the

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,000
pro edition um and the open source

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
edition that they couldn't contribute

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,079
back up because it was in the pro

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,519
edition so they're like

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,360
let's go build something from scratch an

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,240
envoy was born and then envoy is a

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,040
you know a a service slash reverse proxy

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,279
that is used

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,800
all over you know uh the place these

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,519
days so it kind of just shows how an end

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,040
user

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
that may not be happy with their

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,639
existing you know vendor relationship or

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,199
tool they're using like hey we could

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,959
build it

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,240
ourselves you know is i think this all

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,079
goes to the trend of

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,279
you know you know digital transformation

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,079
and companies becoming software

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,839
companies

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,279
as you know you build out a software

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,680
competency you're going to start to

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,079
build

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,199
cool solutions that solve problems for

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
you that may

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,120
solve problems for others that you

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,880
decide to share

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,680
and we are starting to see some interest

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,040
among companies that are not necessarily

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,519
at scale

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,199
consumer internet technology companies

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,040
such as

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,759
spotify or lyft we're starting to see

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,800
companies who may be in more business

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,920
settings

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,679
having a much larger role for

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,760
open source and initiating projects and

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,319
participating projects i think of

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,079
bloomberg as an example in the financial

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,919
sector

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,760
absolutely i mean you saw from today's

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,199
keynote from gab from the

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
fintech open source foundation

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,760
foundation or finos is they're

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,480
essentially getting

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,679
all these uh say traditional very

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,160
traditional finance

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,679
uh heavily regulated companies a safe

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,919
place to collaborate and share

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,480
uh software and ideas so yeah i think

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,720
you're definitely

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,840
definitely right with that point is

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,919
there any data here

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,360
from this year and this first slide that

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,039
you think is

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,960
noteworthy or interesting that you'd

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,120
like to that you'd like to highlight

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,039
just the simple trend of more companies

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,320
contributing to upstream and releasing

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,000
new projects i think that's just

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,600
reflective of kind of what we see

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,280
uh in public i think other than that

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,000
that's no surprises as

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,600
far as i'm called uh as far as as far as

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,400
i can see

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,160
great so we're looking at the top open

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,360
source activities

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,320
in the enterprise and one of the things

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,960
that we still see

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,120
time and time again is compliance income

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,880
how compliance is still a focus

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,880
for for open source program offices

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:24,400
now in this in these results

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,440
we are seeing that open source code

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,240
is being used internally quite a bit

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,840
uh they use it to you know at least some

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,760
of the time it's like you know i think

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,679
how the question was was asked and

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,840
so when you think about that then that

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,280
compliance makes sense doesn't it

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,480
chris in terms of it because they have

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,640
to make sure they're using the right

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,960
versions of everything else

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
yeah i mean it's just it's a legal thing

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,360
at this issue

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,200
to ensure that you're compliant right

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,799
you're using software under a specific

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
license and you have to ensure that from

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,600
a legally

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,840
you know kosher point of view you uh

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,200
comply with those uh terms so yeah i

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,160
mean compliance is always going to be a

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
focus of

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,000
uh a lot of open source um you know

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,000
program management program management

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,880
making that process a lot more efficient

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,679
for engineering teams and so on i think

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,280
is also

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,960
kind of an important goal but yeah i

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,960
mean this is this the

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,080
this is no surprise here as far as i'm

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,160
concerned

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,440
the contributing uh code upstream is

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,160
super interesting

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,840
um you know i think that is growing over

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,360
time you know from my discussions with a

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,600
lot of companies out there

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,720
uh you know not enough companies

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,799
contribute stuff

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,760
upstream um you know a lot of companies

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,840
just kind of go on

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,280
about their lives and you know just do

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
what they need to it's you know open

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,080
source is usually all mutual

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,320
self-interest at the end of the day but

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,480
i really like to see that that number

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,760
uh improve uh over over time

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,960
yeah it fits 51 so it's it's gone past

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,960
that halfway point

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
but that's also reflected in the seventy

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
percent of companies

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,120
who are regularly including open

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,039
sourcing their products right so

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,240
you know if they're using open source in

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,000
their products and they're gonna they

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,640
should be participating upstream to some

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,640
extent right

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,600
yeah go ahead

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,520
yeah i know i i mean it's it's a

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,919
cultural change for companies to

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,840
contribute upstream uh it's not easy

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,360
there's generally sometimes legal dances

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,799
and other things that are done so

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,360
for companies from a more traditional

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,200
setting uh it it it takes time

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,320
so and a lot of this data i see go

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,159
there's things that go

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,760
that that go hand in hand like i was

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,280
mentioning before like

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,600
if you're going to be just being

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,039
upstream projects prior to coping 19

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,000
you'd be traveling to conferences

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,440
because you'd be meeting with people

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
on the end user question because we're

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,400
focusing a lot on end users at the news

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,840
tech and we find that

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,640
the end user stories are really

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,720
interesting we we talked to the you know

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,799
wikimedia and you know which runs

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,320
and there's there's all kinds of scaling

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,280
issues that they're having you know for

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,360
instance because

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,120
they might you know people may not know

00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,679
it but the wikimedia actually runs you

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,000
know the

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,240
you know the wiki software that is used

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
by tiny organizations and very large

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
organizations

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,880
and is used in wikipedia itself and so

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,400
when you're

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,159
so now they're they're thinking of all

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,640
kinds of issues around scale and

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,720
wikimedia is quite involved

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,799
in the sea in in you know in in the

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,799
kubernetes community and the cncf

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,799
and the cloud native ecosystem do you

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,200
have any perspective you can provide

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,120
about

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,120
what kind of increases you're seeing in

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,840
the cn staff around cloud native

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,880
projects in terms of end users

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,799
participation

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,080
i mean i think in general more end user

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,640
companies are

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,440
participating in open source uh projects

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,039
it's not just

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,720
traditionally vendors which has kind of

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,400
been the history of open

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,840
you know open like massive open source

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,039
participation like i mentioned before

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,559
you have companies

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,600
like lyft uh you have uber spotify

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,159
uh the banks uh bloomberg like like

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,480
these

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,559
organizations are all finding ways to

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,000
participate in in the upstream because

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,000
they've realized the pain that

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,440
you know if you're not part of

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
contributing upstream

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,559
it's hard to influence the direction of

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,320
you know

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,320
a project in my perspective

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,840
okay wise did i skip one no this is the

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,760
next slide here

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,280
um yep you know i i

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,360
they people have these open source

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,799
program offices they're going to create

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,159
they're looking to increase adoption

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,360
they're looking to promote open source

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,440
culture

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,960
improve license compliance there's some

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,720
interesting kind of variations in the

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,280
state if you look at it on github

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,960
that shows for instance that you know

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,480
that we'll get to this in a minute but

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,159
how the open source program offices are

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,200
actually narrowing their focus to try to

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,799
be more

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,960
you know just so they can do more with

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,720
what they have um

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,360
but this again is information here that

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,520
shows

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,720
that open source is part of

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,720
organizations

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,159
it hasn't changed much in three years i

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,200
i think we can pretty much kind of

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,400
summarize it this is

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,400
what we've been talking about for the

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,600
past 10 15 minutes

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,520
is there anything else you'd have here

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,960
absolutely no i

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,240
i think it just kind of shows that

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,440
companies are you know having open

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,799
source programs

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,320
whether they're formal informal and

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,600
they're creating policies to kind of

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,520
ensure that

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,600
you know their organization runs more

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,240
efficiently from creating progress

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,440
products to other engineering practices

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,440
yeah so i think we can move on

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,799
now there's some interesting there's

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,320
some data here that

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,280
uh that i think is is interesting though

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,559
because

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,600
it does show that for instance

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,240
that we're starting to see more focus

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,360
again

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,440
on on the program offices overall

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,880
now you might look at this data for

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,760
instance and say oh

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,440
look owning and overseeing execution of

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,640
open source strategy

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,600
it's gone from 67 to 53

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,799
which is a healthy drop but when you

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,919
look at the data a little bit more

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,039
closely

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,159
you'll notice that first of all there

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,279
was

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,960
some um there's some there's some more

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,919
focus in these offices

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,640
but the but still the open source

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,679
offices

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,640
are participating in the open source

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,760
programs they are

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,880
part of the strategy but as this but as

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,240
the number of projects

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,840
increase you can't do it all you have to

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,200
be able to focus on

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,440
you know on the core values of the

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,480
organization

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,240
yeah i mean it's this data is kind of a

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,240
little bit variable in some places where

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
compliance seems to have like ping pong

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,600
back and forth

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,559
and there's been kind of a decrease of

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
you know owning

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,679
you know overall execution of open

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,320
source strategy and i think part of that

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,760
is

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,440
every open source office is a little bit

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,919
different right obviously the informal

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,799
ones

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,320
are not going to be fully you know in

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,159
control of open source strategy that may

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,080
be delegated down to the actual business

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,760
unit and kind of the informal

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,600
open source program is there to kind of

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,360
assist to ensure you know practices are

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,760
being followed compliance is

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,559
you know being respected and and so on

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,279
so it's

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,000
kind of interesting to you know see the

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,440
data because

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,440
you know in some ways since open source

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,760
is becoming super commonplace

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,279
a lot of the business units or products

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,279
you know are kind of owning

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,640
you know uh some of the overall

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,880
direction of whether

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,320
you know their stuff will be open source

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,679
or parts of it will be um

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,159
you know open source and the open source

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,640
program really serves as a kind of a

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,200
a service role um you know to the

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,120
organization versus actually overseeing

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,720
the whole strategy for for for the

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,159
organization but we'll see that's just a

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,120
thesis we'll kind of you know it'll be

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,400
interesting to kind of dive into the

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,240
data in the future to see

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,159
how that's reflected across different

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,679
industry verticals and so on so i'm kind

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,640
of excited to dive into that

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,320
later we have a question actually and i

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,320
thought we should just ask because we

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,000
you know we don't have a lot of time

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,240
and uh it comes from

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,840
mo shoujoji who's asking what are your

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,080
recommendations for government

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,760
sector software and cloud-based services

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,080
and i think he's probably asking about

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,799
open program offices in particular and

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,440
open source

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,840
yeah i think so so there's two things

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
here

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,600
one um you know i'm uh uh so

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,840
uh there are governments out there that

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,840
you know like the canada uk

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,360
uh kind of have open source program

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,240
offices within kind of their digital

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,400
services

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
organization so i think as a government

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,520
entity having some type of

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,159
uh office for you know whether you know

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
it's a

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,480
digital transformation whatever you want

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,760
to call it something that's kind of

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,080
dedicated into

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,799
improving the consumption of open source

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
within

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,559
a government organization is important

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,799
um you know i'm a firm believer that

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,480
you know uh tax-based revenue or revenue

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,679
that's essentially used to build

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,039
software in a government setting that

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,799
stuff should be open source

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,880
to begin with and so having somebody to

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,640
help uh improve that is important you

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,600
know there has been work

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,279
um out there by certain organizations

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,919
within at least in the u.s there's been

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,080
a uh

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,360
source uh an open source policy that

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,039
they've open source for all the

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,640
government to ensure that you know some

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,000
level of software that they're building

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
is actually open source uh france uh has

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,279
also

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,080
been developing a kind of generic open

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,279
source policy

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,640
to be used by um the uh you know eu uh

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,520
member countries that you could find

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,679
online

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,039
uh but yeah i think in in general like

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,720
having you know

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,159
an open source program for a government

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,000
it should be no different really from

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,520
you know in a company you just you're

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,640
just optimizing for different things for

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,080
a government you generally

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,320
want to optimize the production and

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,080
usage of open source software to either

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,679
save money for your constituencies

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,960
and so on so hopefully that answers your

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,240
question but i will send out some

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,960
information with kind of links for those

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,919
policies for for governments but yeah

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,360
we should we have given that we have a

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,720
few minutes left alex maybe we'll kind

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,840
of wrap up on kind of one

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,919
um uh one point maybe i i think given

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,080
its time it's coveted times maybe should

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,200
wrap up the last uh point regarding the

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,080
funding levels

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,240
i believe that's uh yeah there there it

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,240
is

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,000
so uh i i i it's been interesting at

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,039
least you know

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,200
um with with my cncf

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,360
had on and cloud cloud native had on

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,360
i've actually seen

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,799
an acceleration of people and

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,799
organizations out there

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,640
accelerating the move to cloud and

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,760
spending more money to kind of get there

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,480
with the thesis that they're going to

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,480
save money in the long run i think open

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,960
source is a huge part of that journey

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,840
i think we've seen in general that uh

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,399
even though

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
um you know we're living in very kind of

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,120
unique pandemic times

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,880
there is a desire to increase uh

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,520
funding for open source programs in

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,200
these times most people are neutral

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,760
uh and very few people are looking kind

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,919
of um you know decrease around around 10

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,520
so i i think in general open source

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,720
tends to be very counter cyclical when

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,399
it comes to

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,000
tough economic times if we looked at the

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,159
last recession

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,600
things like red hat you know boomed and

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,240
open source companies in general were

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,360
seated

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,760
a lot of the time that i've done

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,279
extremely well uh you know these days

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,360
given all the kind of open source

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,120
you know ipos out there such as

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,799
and elastic and so on so

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,320
i i think we'll see similar things where

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,279
companies are going to step back

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,039
and look to invest more in uh ways to

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,399
optimize how they do engineering and

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,679
other cost efficiencies that they could

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,480
look for and open source is going to be

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,840
a huge

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,080
uh part of that in my opinion yeah

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,039
just uh some vertical industry data that

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,679
we haven't

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,799
uh had time to get put into uh you know

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,360
into this survey

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,320
but for instance i mean you're talking

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,559
earlier about

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,159
you know vertical industries that are

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,120
increasing their usage of open source

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,679
software

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,840
our data actually showed that 42 of the

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,279
31 health care respondents

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,039
said they are at least sometimes

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,360
contributing upstream

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:44,399
and that in 2019 that figure was 23

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,440
and we think we can contribute attribute

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,799
that to the kobe 19 projects

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,880
yeah i mean it'll be interesting to

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,399
slice the data once we fully open source

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,320
it out there so

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,679
i look forward to kind of getting that

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,640
done given that we're kind of

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,080
i think we hit our time uh limit as far

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,360
as i'm concerned maybe not i thought we

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,799
had 30 minutes maybe you correct

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,520
me i i'm just going to keep going until

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,799
they tell us

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,799
let's do it let's

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,840
the top five benefits for existing

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,039
programs in 2020

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,399
um uh increase innovation awareness of

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,080
open source

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,600
uh and commercial dependencies one thing

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,440
that i that i think is interesting and

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,640
maybe this will change this year

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,159
is that i i i think of open source

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,640
program offices have historically been

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,320
almost like knowledge management

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,240
groups they actually have they have so

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,640
much knowledge that they

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,000
they have and traditionally knowledge

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,600
management groups don't get a lot of

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,279
funding and i think it's true of open

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,480
source program offices they haven't

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,640
had significant amounts of funding and

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,600
that then affects their visibility

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,600
internally

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,000
um adding you know inside of an

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,880
organization

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,880
yeah is that changing do you think that

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,080
we're going to start to see more

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,519
pretty more bigger budgets and more

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,480
visibility a higher level it's so mixed

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,080
across the board

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,000
i mean if you look at an organization

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,519
like google or intel they spend

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,519
tons and tons of money on huge amounts

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,320
of staff other organizations tend to be

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,840
a little bit smaller

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,399
sometimes it's individual or it's

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,760
part-time i think you know

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,440
i don't want to look at it purely from

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,720
like a fiscal perspective i'd like to

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,399
look at more from like an impact

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,240
perspective like what you know what what

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,679
does an open source organization

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,159
you know what impact does it have for

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,279
the overall you know organization in

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,919
terms of like you know

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,120
uh either efficiency or you know what

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,200
they're able to kind of

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,240
uh impact from like a business results

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,519
perspective so

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,000
i don't think that's always inherently

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,080
tied how well-funded an organization

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,679
is but you know we'll see how the data

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,519
you know changes year over year i'll be

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,399
curious to see how things evolve

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,919
in the post kind of covid uh era and and

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,120
see if truly the the

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,200
theory that open source is a

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,120
counter-cyclical uh thing

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,240
during during tough times and we'll see

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,279
if there's more investment i don't know

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,919
we're still very early

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,200
we did the survey in may and june so you

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,360
know understand that that

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,360
at that specific time slice of the

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,279
pandemic that's the kind of data that we

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,960
are working with right

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,440
again i mean i talked about the

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,159
challenges um awareness and support

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,880
uh this is what people are saying um

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,880
budgets

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,559
uh influencing open source project

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,559
internal awareness of the programs

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,039
we need to wrap up in just a minute so

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,000
we're going to have to run but

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,279
i think maybe just in conclusion we

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,600
should just say

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,679
hey this has been another year for

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,679
another uh

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,840
another example of the of the

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,720
advancement of open source

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,360
um i'll wait to see if that actual 82

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,840
number goes up to 99

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,799
to chris and and how that'll affect the

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,399
other numbers

00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,919
um but it seems like we're not we're

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,840
still on an upward increase

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,120
it does seem that there is some kind of

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,840
like

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,840
i don't know um like like some flatness

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,840
in open source program offices and

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,120
and in terms of like i'm looking to see

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,399
what's going to like help them get to

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,480
that next level maybe

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,840
in conclusion you can help us understand

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,279
that because it's so critical to open

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,360
source overall in enterprise

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,720
organizations

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,000
yeah i mean i think part of it is an

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,240
awareness thing i think a lot of

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,679
companies don't understand the needs for

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,360
formal open source program management

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,200
unless they felt pain whether it's a

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,279
compliance thing or

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,960
you know something that an engineer uh

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,399
done i mean i i think the the analogy i

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,519
use go back to

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,679
house you know uh secure chief security

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,919
officers and security offices

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,519
um you know were formed it wasn't until

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,039
i think the mid 90s where the first one

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,960
is for him and now is due to

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,559
security incidents and over time almost

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,640
every organization now

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,000
has someone responsible for security

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,480
because they probably

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,080
have felt some pain right and i think

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,679
you know a similar pattern will will

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,640
play over time with open source program

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,559
offices where

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,919
companies will uh learn from their peers

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,679
in the industry and they may have felt

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,120
pain that they're like oh my gosh we

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,120
had a compliance issue we need to

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,519
establish an open source program office

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,119
or

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,440
oh cool look another organization out

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,760
there um you know has

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,720
uh an open source program so we're going

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,440
to learn from what they did

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,800
but on that i look forward to you know

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,079
collaborating with you in the future and

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,320
everyone can kind of see the results

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,599
on tutorgroup.org just find it on our

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,839
github um

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,280
thank you very much thanks chris thank

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,800
you very much thanks to

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,399
the open source summit for having us

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
today we look forward to more research

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,839
on this topic

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,839
