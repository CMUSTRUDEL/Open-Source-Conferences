hello everyone so welcome to the do you

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,870
see a new new experience for the Yocto

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,170
project and openembedded both at ESC so

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,969
I mean as everybody knows this is the

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,480
first time for everyone what it is going

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,740
to be a virtual event so I'm Nicolas de

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,380
Shannon the Yocto project committee

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,330
manager and with me we have Phillip

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,820
Bannister

00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:32,759
Phillip hello so the boss is always a

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,370
very interesting exercise so we are here

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,680
as speakers but really what we want to

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,780
do is we want people to ask questions

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,090
and we want someone from the audience

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,280
which answer the question so our job is

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,070
to find questions and to find who can

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,140
answer the questions so we have started

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,800
and we have prepared a few slides to

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,899
just get started and get let's warm up

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,469
so we'll go quickly through the slides

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,059
and hopefully we'll have questions so

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,210
maybe there are few things we have to

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,240
say about the logistics so there is the

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,420
live chat I think I mean you can ask

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,100
questions and you can raise your hands

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,740
if you want to talk or say something and

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,960
we have Jennifer from a left today that

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,049
will help us get you put you on stage

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,780
when once your eyes yet so we'll do our

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,150
best to use this tool I'm told this is

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,210
we are the very first people that you

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:30,360
use it today so if you raise your hand

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:37,020
we give you will give you the make at

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:39,030
some point okay so yeah and if you have

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,670
anything I mean just asking the live

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,729
chat we are tip and I will try to keep

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,280
an eye on a live chat as well so some

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,740
project updates quickly we like to do

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,040
that since the last Ike last time we had

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,009
the buff which was at Elte we've made a

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,439
number of release for the octo project

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,680
so I mean you have all the numbers all

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,000
the BIOS release so we'll be quite busy

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,670
the engineering team has been busy with

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,550
people around the world the one thing to

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,989
actually really highlight and think and

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,450
I hope we are going to talk about that

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,200
today is a 3.1 which is the very first

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,880
project

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,150
LTS

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,660
is finally which has been done in April

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,520
and yeah so that's I mean one of the

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,200
reason why we need a dog in the LTS is

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,570
because we've talked us about the lack

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,010
of LTS at many buffs before so hopefully

00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,930
we can talk about why when what is being

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,040
changed now that we have the LTS so

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,160
that's just to give you an idea about

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,050
how we are busy and who are the

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,620
developers and how many developers are

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:45,290
actually contributing to the is some

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,140
also I mean values updates about the

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,060
project so since the the last thing we

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,150
talked to is we had some membership

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,850
updates you probably have all seen the

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,650
news Microsoft has joined the product as

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,020
platinum and we have two existing

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,620
members who have abated two platinum

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,080
Cisco and anxieties and also a few

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,720
months ago a GL the automotive-grade

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,790
Enix's have joined the project and again

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,620
this is very important for us the

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,100
membership is actually what found the

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,510
project and they also here to involved

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,400
in the day-to-day direction of the

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:23,330
project and that's very important for us

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,600
and we welcome all our members because

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,460
without saying the project is almost 10

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,810
years old and that's quite a milestone

00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,820
so we talk about that I mean a long year

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,370
sadly we are not all together for this

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,410
anniversary but that's that's a serious

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,120
milestone for the project and we are be

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,790
able to all the work done over the years

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,240
and hopefully what's coming for the next

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,940
ten years I think we talked about that a

00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,980
few times but we have some we have

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,680
Joseph which who is a very active

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,340
community member from the project and

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,400
openembedded

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,560
and he's doing very often once a month

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,740
once in a few weeks some live coding

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,959
sessions on Twitch which is like a video

00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,030
streaming platform if you don't know

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,190
what it is I encourage you to go and

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,270
ping and find Joseph is here yet she's

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:16,310
here today and is basically just hanging

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,920
out with is computer and doing something

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,900
with eye open and very dr. whinging show

00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,080
it's showing you how to redo it and how

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,580
to use it it's it's fun and it's

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,680
actually are being watched more and more

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,949
so I encourage you to other

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,320
into these things last time we thought I

00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:35,870
think I mentioned that we were moving

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,669
the infrastructure side of all the list

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,289
mailing list for the ecto project and

00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:42,080
the open and ready to go that I oh happy

00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:43,910
to report that it's done and we don't

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,190
have much to say because it just works

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,550
and that's good so now all the lists are

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,650
hosted in Cooper you finally some

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,419
question we have very often people I

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,729
mean who want to start and they start

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,110
with like a simple bug fix a simple

00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,030
thing and get something mail chain

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,400
upstream for the other project open a

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,490
beginning of them of our project we have

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,820
a specific wiki page with some entry

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:12,430
point for for people who want to start

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,430
and end contributing on small small bugs

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,949
okay a couple of more highlights so the

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,990
LTS I'm not I'm going to skip this one

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:26,270
there was a talk earlier today and I

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,680
mean it's been discussed hopefully any

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,570
people know what they are and I'm sure

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,580
there will be questions but yeah your

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,849
project as its first IDs which is

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,070
creating hash equivalents and about

00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:41,300
produce ability I've been enabled by

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,710
default now so they have been available

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,900
for quite some time but they were not

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,820
enable so if you notice any change if

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,789
you find an issue with these things feel

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:53,300
free to reach out to our community and

00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:54,800
we would walk with you but each so it

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,669
doesn't come as a surprise actually

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,470
something which is enabled by default

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,509
one more date something like that a new

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:07,159
mini project that we've started

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:09,620
it's a chi not me we are in the process

00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:10,940
of doing a migration for the Yocto

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,460
document you have to project

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,099
documentation from what it is today

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,990
which is based on doc book and we've

00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:19,729
chosen to move to Sphinx it's been a

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:24,199
it's been a decision that has been a

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:26,620
fool by the project ESC the migration is

00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,300
just starting now so if you are

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,680
interested and if you use the octo

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,720
project documentation like probably

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,430
everyone out there and if you like this

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,830
documentation and want to contribute to

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,659
the next version of the documentation

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,820
feel free to join there is a dedicated

00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,870
mailing list doc mailing list on the

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,720
list

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,790
at all and there are many reasons why we

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,210
do that if there are any questions we

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:52,910
can quality dive into that so in terms

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,770
of maintenance and what we want to do

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:59,080
with the documentation we felt it was

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,080
actually like that to do the make a shoe

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,110
if you want to break this one yeah

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:12,260
so I'm Phillip Alistair I'm also on the

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,760
openembedded board which is basically

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,570
the build system that got the whole

00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,060
Yocto project started and we hosted a

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,940
workshop in February in Brussels the day

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:26,120
after Falls dum and we had sponsorship

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,790
from the Yocto project so Thank You Nico

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,060
we have recordings that should go live

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:36,380
real soon now and you can get a link to

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,870
those from the URL on screen there which

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:43,910
is also should be findable from the open

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:47,630
embedded web site and we had probably 20

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:49,820
25 people there and it was very well

00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,820
received and we would like to do

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,830
something similar again because it's

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:59,540
very nice to have you know one day of

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:01,160
just concentrated talks so please talk

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,900
to me about you know running this

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,030
virtually unless you know the world

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,630
improves dramatically in the next few

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,340
months we should think about doing one

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,470
of these virtually to see how it goes

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,540
and I'm very interested in getting

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,420
people to talk about what they're doing

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,400
who are not normally presenting at

00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,630
things this is a smaller environment a

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
little bit easier to get your feet wet

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,660
so we would like to get more people

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:33,680
talking about their work it's clear the

00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:36,800
next slide Nico this is the list of

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,590
talks at this conference and you've

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,420
already missed the LTS talk that Nico

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:45,890
did earlier this is the ball and one

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,830
that I would like to just call your

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,510
attention to is on Wednesday Joshua want

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,150
is going to talk about reproducible

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,640
builds and hash equivalence which we

00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,740
touched on recently on a

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:04,880
slide as something some recent work in

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:07,700
the project okay next slide and we all

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,110
know I feel any out of my day you know

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:18,280
it's so this is the interactive part

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:21,320
part of the boss and for the audience

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,690
one thing I always like to hear is what

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,030
are we doing well and what can we do

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,930
better especially things that we haven't

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:32,660
thought about so this is sort of throw

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,580
it out to the audience and see if anyone

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:38,360
has any questions if you have questions

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,490
please type them into chat so if you're

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,470
if you've been to the buff before I mean

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,960
you know how we like these things like

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,090
any kind of questions and there are in

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,060
the room I mean I mean I can organise

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:52,340
many developers from different places of

00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,810
the projects so we can hopefully answer

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,490
lots of questions and any questions you

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,580
have if you've not done the buff before

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,050
you know that I mean we will make sure

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:17,210
that we find the right person to answer

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:20,150
your question okay okay yeah okay so

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,890
we've got a couple of questions I'm

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,080
brand new to yard two and I want to

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,710
start compiling a lessons for arm where

00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,180
should I start

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:35,930
do we have anyone from arm here who can

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:39,260
answer that okay what we can at least

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:43,100
give the genie and so there are octo

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,840
project documentation we have the Quick

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,360
Start Guide which will guide you through

00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,830
at your winning your first beat and you

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,260
might choose to just be the forearm

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,530
that's fine and you will end up with

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,000
something that can walk in like a qmu

00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,720
theater platform that could be our more

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,590
anything this

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,540
so I mean since you asked for all

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,550
especially there is an arm community

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,960
around openembedded and the octo project

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,370
is dedicated mailing lists

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,100
it's called beta arm

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,809
at least up to the Lord so feel free to

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,550
join at least and then you can show any

00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:22,319
questions or any specific arm questions

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:23,639
you can ask them ok and I'm still

00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:26,519
learning how this works we have any

00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,459
special questions tab as well

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:33,029
Nico and I think Richard is going to

00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:36,569
have to answer this one we have I have

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:39,180
immensely enjoyed using bitbake the

00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:42,420
build tool behind Yocto I often like to

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,059
use bitbake without parky is there a

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:50,160
simpler way to use bitbake without Oh a

00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:52,170
 ini well I'm guessing that's meant

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,809
to say there it'll be the opening

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,009
but it build in and script all that

00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:57,779
script does is just add some

00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,189
environmental variables so if you don't

00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,170
want to use that figure out what

00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:03,959
variables you need to set it's usually I

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,350
think PP pass and go from there but you

00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:10,199
don't have to have it yes ok so if you

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:13,499
look in the top level of openembedded -

00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:17,459
core and this is what I do all the time

00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:18,809
there's catch me afterwards and I can

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:22,470
tell you and what the exact name of the

00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:25,350
script is and how it works yeah good

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,389
catch Richard I was thinking that he was

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,999
running bitbake alone without any

00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:33,720
metadata because I over complicate

00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:35,429
everything that's possible - but yeah I

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,319
knew that's why I immediately thought of

00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:41,759
you because you know that's the way it

00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:43,709
was designed to work ok yeah putting

00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,509
questions in the questions section is

00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:49,499
going to work easier I think because I

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:52,079
can't see it and the chat so when do we

00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:59,189
expect Yocto will support a read-only

00:12:52,079 --> 00:13:02,040
route FS with system D we have any

00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:04,879
system D gurus in the room who might be

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,879
able to have an answer

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:18,320
raise your hand okay let's skip that one

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,820
and hope someone answers it Nico we

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,510
might need to take these and take them

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,190
to chat afterwards as well so hopefully

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:29,270
we can keep a list of the questions that

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:32,390
we don't get good answers for so we also

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,070
have a question is CGL meta cgl still

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:41,570
being maintained does anyone know an

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:43,460
answer to that well there's a couple of

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,790
systemd one so I can quickly touch on

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,440
those for the system D read-only routes

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,300
FS I think it's a question of somebody

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,700
figure out and sending patches I think

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,290
it works in some configurations well

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,000
it's not perfect so it is just a

00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,980
question of sending patches there's also

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,950
a question asking is sis 5 and it going

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,840
to be dropped in favor of system D and

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,280
there's probably a similar question

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,370
where people are saying are we going to

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,200
make system D the default to cover those

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,230
ones I know we've talked about this in

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,880
the past buffs we were going to switch

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,650
over the system D as a default but

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,150
because of all of the changes it was

00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,310
just going to make to the testing matrix

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:22,160
it's actually made sense to keep system

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:26,840
5 in it as the default have system D as

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,490
the pocky alt consult the old distro the

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,650
alt of the altar into testing

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,500
configuration and therefore we test both

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,240
equally now and we have no plans to drop

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,130
sis five in it at this point both how

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:43,180
the users and yeah no plans to drop it

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:45,650
so we've got a raised hand that's Jenny

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,230
Jeremy wants to use the mint and a

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:54,020
format CJ want to say something hey

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:55,580
Jimmy can you okay basically I'm the

00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,500
current maintainer a couple of the other

00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,690
maintainers have been vectored off to

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,400
other projects so they're not active as

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,080
much but we are accepting patches

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,800
they're having little patches that went

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,230
in for Dumbo

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,740
did you have if you have things that are

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:13,570
the need to be fixed or updates by all

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,570
means cinnamon and you will possibly

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:22,790
right thanks Jeremy okay thank you so I

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,410
get questioned about ninja so we

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,820
actually lost good job so each other if

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,880
you want to come back he left Eurasia

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:32,120
and again are there any plans to move to

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:36,080
Mason dangers out of the default bid

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:42,250
mechanism which all you want to take

00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:47,660
this one house may be right you know

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:51,580
yeah it is a big move down India will

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,690
make some as the upstream move

00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,940
changing our quarry on toe

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,430
by default it doesn't make a sense that

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,920
we are actively switching as upstream

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:16,100
packages to for all the good reasons

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:19,760
everyone loves Mazal okay thank you do

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,800
you take that question we go do you have

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,130
pointers on how to easily create

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:29,440
bootloaders for custom balls that use

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:32,630
arm always five so do we have any

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,620
maintenance of baseball players would

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,620
like to raise the hands

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:54,300
now cam can we yeah

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:57,240
thank you yeah can you repeat the

00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,910
question once again yeah and get back to

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,449
the questions there are any pointers too

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,089
easily

00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:06,179
I think the oldies it is important input

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:11,520
row bios boot loaders for custom board

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:14,610
that use our obvious 5 so yeah I think

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,610
the boot loaders are basically primary

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:20,339
you know part of the sock development

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,780
rather open embedded provides the

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,589
environment for you to work with it

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:28,020
right so but we don't like have branches

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,990
or any of that sort that you would want

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,910
to do however we do have like at least

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,570
for respite there is open

00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:39,270
SBI right which is actually available in

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,669
matter is five I think it is in the core

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:46,020
now yeah I reason in the core method

00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:49,710
area so it is kept up to date to the

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,260
latest releases so but I think you have

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,679
to participate in open HDI you know

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,049
ecosystem to do the development and you

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,630
could use a you know your project to

00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:04,169
build and test and basically it can be

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,330
your build system but I think from

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:08,280
community aspect I think the upstream

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:15,750
respective upstream communities are

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:17,940
where you want to participate okay

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,520
one question about PowerPC someone is

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:30,600
asking what happened to PowerPC support

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:38,419
and if it's called reach out maybe you

00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:38,419
want to come back swimming you can

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,820
okay can your bike I don't know

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:58,100
yeah so the powerpc question right we

00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:01,490
still have our PC in the core code in by

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:05,810
PowerPC 64 for example the port was

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:09,770
added and our I think there is no woody

00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:14,450
call like you know each ball device or

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:19,280
anything talk behind it that is being

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:20,960
regularly tested no it's also like

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,870
matter of someone supporting it and

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,270
backing it and making sure that you know

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,990
it runs through all the tests and the

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:34,040
auto builder requirements for it to be

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:35,570
maintained there but it builds fine I

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,610
think as of now I think from testing

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,040
point of view is where you'd have this

00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,920
drop but if somebody is using it

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,770
according it it is still there and

00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:53,090
patties are still accepted if someone

00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:55,580
sends path is respective to PowerPC okay

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,930
thank you cam so we have a question

00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,200
interesting question about license

00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,810
manifests so I think we need you a child

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,970
there is a process to collect or license

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,880
information about the ship's open source

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,890
packages the generated license manifest

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,470
is a good starting point but the process

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:19,600
of correcting the copyright holders for

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:19,600
all packages is TMAO yeah

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,540
Alya there's some tools in there that

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,540
allow you to

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:39,720
we are losing you each other you can't

00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:42,520
hear me can now I'll try again done yeah

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,560
there's a layered mattress PDX scanner

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,810
which has some good tools in for

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,470
handling a variety of different licensed

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:52,720
situations so that includes not just

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,240
licenses but also copyright information

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,830
so it takes some open-source tools some

00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,750
of the main force ology some of them in

00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,640
other repositories pulls them together

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,150
and then allows them to find things like

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,890
copyright information so ultimately I'd

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,600
love to see more integration with some

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,760
of these things into the core of the

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,920
project but for now I would go and look

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,390
at master of Medeiros PDX scanner and

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,560
some of those tools because there's

00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:18,190
definitely tools out there that can

00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,980
collect that information and I'm just

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,210
not entirely sure which ones

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,070
madara speedy axe scanner is enabling

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,570
right now I think it does have copyright

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,220
scanning in there but if it doesn't it

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,450
should be easy to add using the sort of

00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:33,970
the process that's already there for

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:37,360
licensure okay

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:40,270
Thank You H on your question of video

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,660
should I continue go ahead if you see

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:47,500
one I'll take the next one okay so we

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:50,680
have an e SDK SDK question so prepare to

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,960
raise your hand if you know the answer I

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,660
don't understand the workflow of

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,330
bringing artifacts produced by teams

00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,650
using the SDK into my final image where

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:04,870
is the best place to get more

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:06,790
information about that would like

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:13,930
someone so where is a hand

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:18,850
I was hoping Paul would be here for that

00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:23,320
one which is back I'm not back I never

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,850
left I don't think I figured I get

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,710
removed as soon as somebody else raises

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:32,020
their hand I think do you want to answer

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,300
this question or I can certainly have a

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,520
try I mean bringing back Ian's artifacts

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,030
is usually a question of writing the

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,130
recipe to then go and build code

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,260
all the standard model of you know

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:48,000
contributing into a shared estate cash

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:49,290
and working that way it is sort of it is

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,520
the same sort of step as you would

00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,860
normally use for bringing things back

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,780
into a normal build which can then

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,910
inject them back into any SDK it's sort

00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,470
of designed to be circular all right I

00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,810
am a little bit disappointed we haven't

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,670
been able to develop the SDK further

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,260
than we have I think there's some good

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,710
ideas in there equally there's some

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,270
things that you know both Paul and I

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,950
would do differently given the

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,750
experiences that we've had and there's

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,580
ways we'd like to improve it so if

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,140
people are looking at that I think it's

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,000
something that probably needs a little

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,150
bit more work on its developer workflows

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,920
I think the ideas are good but yeah it's

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,870
unfortunately the people originally

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,890
working on that have been moved on to

00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,040
other things and there isn't really

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:31,050
development going on so it would be

00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,580
great if the new sort of generation of

00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:36,470
people want to step forward you figure

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,470
out way to take there that'll be awesome

00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,870
okay can you go I lost the window okay

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,000
please find it again instead I recommend

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,460
a tutorial in regards to creating a

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,670
Jenkins configuration file and setting

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,590
up a pipeline so that's a good question

00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:00,690
so we can see if anyone I mean they're I

00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,570
mean as probably everybody knows I mean

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,220
there is not one way don't you build on

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,440
this opening video build with the

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,780
optimum and everybody else more as they

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,840
always so that's for your difficult

00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,240
questions what I wanted to say before we

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,000
can ask the audience is that there is a

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,910
talk on the Yocto project dev Day on

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,550
Thursday on how to what you do see ICD

00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,500
with the octo project and get rap it's

00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,210
not drinking I mean it's it's a hot

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,670
topic it's something that many people do

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,520
in their own way and we actually wanted

00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:35,810
to show one of our committee members on

00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,920
how to do that whiskey slab can someone

00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:41,870
someone has anything to say about

00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,870
Jenkins and openembedded

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:57,020
I've done it but in very brute-force

00:24:48,950 --> 00:25:01,070
manner yeah I gave a talk at edinburgh i

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,500
think on living on master building with

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:07,630
with jenkins and keeping everything

00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,220
together so it is a very beautiful

00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:12,409
things it's also a bit complicated but

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,830
in terms of pipelines you know i would

00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:20,149
recommend when you're looking at the

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:24,740
groovy scripting language and doing it

00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:28,070
builds that way we we were building at

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:31,100
that time using the pocky container from

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,649
crops so all of our builds were done in

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,340
Pocky or sorry in the container in

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:39,190
docker containers there were some

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,690
gotchas in that regard in terms of

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:44,419
number of childhoods and things like

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:49,010
that that can get in the way these days

00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:51,529
I would probably look at Iraq which

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:54,279
basically wraps all your bit calls with

00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:56,470
a container Oh

00:25:54,279 --> 00:26:00,230
if you have any other specific questions

00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:05,090
in New York under the boot and I can try

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:07,250
to chair more and someone puts their

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,860
comments that they experiment with

00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:13,210
Jenkins and get let's see I and follow

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:16,460
engage Lexi I strike a simpler to use

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:19,880
and we've got a couple hands up or a

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,460
hand up they meet you all

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,250
yes I just said I added a chat to the

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,289
question about ESD case there is a tool

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,210
in there to export your custom content

00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:30,860
to a layer it once it's in layer that it

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,649
can go anywhere you wanted to do in my

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,049
project so that's a general solution and

00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:37,789
I also added a poly ok the author he'll

00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:39,529
be our dev day so if you want to see him

00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:40,970
he's also been haunting the booth so

00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:42,140
talk about there a tour is flat but

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,760
he'll be a dead things would ask

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:50,919
specific questions so we talked about

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,919
dev tool in general thank you

00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:56,380
we have those a hand hey come on

00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:02,330
okay you can hear me now just cut out

00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,460
for a second there yeah I just wanted to

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,710
say regarding the Jenkins I work for

00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,870
Wind River and I've been experimenting I

00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,850
guess last three years with Jenkins and

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:14,410
docker swarm and I put some stuff up on

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:17,090
our open-source labs page for creating

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,860
we're doing builds doing winter Linux

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,480
bills but it should be fairly the only

00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,060
should be a lot of that stuff is

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,310
relevant for building Yocto I'm gonna be

00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,130
talking about some of that stuff in the

00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,750
dev days as well so if you have any

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,860
questions I'm happy to talk about it I'm

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,170
trying to move away from Jenkins

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,520
personally I'm looking at kubernetes and

00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,870
Tecton and other things but if you're

00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,670
interested in those sort of details I'm

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,670
happy to talk I've talked about them

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:48,650
okay okay Thank You Bella I've got a

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,370
question here are there any interesting

00:27:48,650 --> 00:28:03,800
tools using the tinfoil API to bitbake

00:27:52,370 --> 00:28:06,070
internally or public we lose richard

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,070
again

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:30,900
lots of tools safety so Tim say devtool

00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:30,900
Oh which is back all in foil inside

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:38,169
there those are good places to start

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,770
people are starting to use it in other

00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,919
places

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:54,070
I can't think maybe the big the public

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:58,059
tools but yeah ok so there's some usage

00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:00,280
apparently I had another one I don't

00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:02,049
know what this question means I'm just

00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,900
kind of curious if anyone out here can

00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:08,590
help is there a group of people who want

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:11,350
to focus on support 4ft p.m. or physical

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:15,940
support this may also benefit from a

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:23,110
read-only root filesystem anyone have

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:29,380
any ideas going in any clarification for

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:32,169
the question all right I was kind of a

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,240
fishing expedition I guess are you guys

00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:36,160
definitely can ask us questions we don't

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,000
know the answer to but that doesn't mean

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,919
that there's not people working on it

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,830
because we see an incredible diversity

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:49,510
of abuse cases for this some of which

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:54,280
we've never thought of in our entire

00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:56,890
lives so this is an easier one I hope

00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,590
are there any plans for Yocto to support

00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:04,809
fetching build artifacts from sources

00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:09,070
like artifactory or conan nice is

00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:11,110
interesting I'm still here I've heard

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,299
people asking about that before it

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:17,350
should be possible by doing that as a

00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:19,600
fetcher module but I've not seen anybody

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,700
submit patches for it yet and I don't

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,970
have access to such things myself so I'm

00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,290
problem

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,700
unlikely to do it but they cook the coat

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,490
the ability is definitely there in the

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:35,470
codebase to add in the modules for it

00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:39,280
so Conan is for building binaries I saw

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:42,070
talk on this as far as them this is it

00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,520
sounds like they want to fetch binaries

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:50,920
built in another system and then build

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:52,540
packages alright if we don't have good

00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,150
answers for your questions we'll be

00:30:52,540 --> 00:31:02,350
around the chat for the rest of the week

00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:05,680
I can see a question oh oh you will say

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:08,290
something I would just like to add that

00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,810
there was an example implementation of a

00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:13,780
Conan fecha a couple of weeks or months

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:15,660
back on the mailing list and Paul Barker

00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:20,470
who unfortunately isn't with us today

00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:22,960
had severe questions or concerns about

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,600
the licensing problems with it because

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,680
you basically pull binary artifacts

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,720
without any proper licensing information

00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,750
from somewhere in the cloud and pulled

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,550
them into your build so unless the conan

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:40,980
folks actually get their stuff sorted

00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,980
out first we cannot properly do this

00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:53,340
yes dawn artifactory I think you know

00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:54,269
the setups are very proprietary or at

00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,100
least that's what I've seen

00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:58,860
so there are fetchers that are around

00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,559
that you're specific to implementations

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:04,320
is how you set up the factory and it has

00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:07,619
like exchange of credentials and things

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,600
like that you can say that it can be

00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,159
done anymore like generic fashion and

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,970
then the authentication part could be

00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:18,629
separated out but we haven't done that

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:20,279
but yeah so far haven't all that it

00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:23,600
would be a generic solution that would

00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:25,070
be appropriate in the core or elsewhere

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,809
[Music]

00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:33,720
so that's what I wanted to mention for

00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:38,129
artifactory and we've got one more hand

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:48,059
the hand went down thank you I think it

00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:50,460
was me and he disappeared again while

00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,889
we're waiting let's do this question I'm

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,590
just starting to learn about Yocto does

00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:58,519
it support Lu KS encryption for mounted

00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,519
file systems

00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:11,380
I know I've seen some talks about

00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,660
encryption for file systems and like I

00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,280
want to say there's one in the open

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:20,050
embedded workshop but I'm not sure if

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,540
it's that specific encryption yeah you

00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,940
know what was one of the things were

00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,750
supported by Intel IOT rekt it you know

00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:32,080
I realized clears old now but if you go

00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:34,810
look for that I can post the link into

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,380
the chat that was supported there and

00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:42,520
also there's some references on like in

00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:44,500
XP nice community board about doing Lux

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,430
encryption and so on so it's definitely

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:51,300
supported it's just a matter of setting

00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,740
up your configuration properly and then

00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:57,420
The Devil's always in the details in

00:33:53,740 --> 00:34:00,130
terms of what specifically your build

00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:03,190
system what your in being a building

00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:07,200
with your images you know so but flex

00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,200
has definitely supported definitely work

00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:21,109
okay I saw a question about the CP no I

00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,329
don't see a question anymore but someone

00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:26,389
was asking about the deprecation of the

00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:28,700
is eh CP which I just think I've been

00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:32,240
I've seen discussed embedding this IRC

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,669
like this week or last last week also a

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,720
chart you want to explain what's gonna

00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:37,720
happen with the HCP

00:34:51,639 --> 00:35:03,029
oh my guys feel free to jump in if we

00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:15,849
I'm flipping through all the questions

00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:17,980
anybody else wants to take also I think

00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:23,170
you were discussing the DHCP you want to

00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,700
answer this question okay so there is

00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,200
the answer that's what I thought but

00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,710
yeah yeah it's going to the answer is

00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,299
yes it's going to be replaced with Kia

00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:35,890
and it's going to happen on master soon

00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:37,509
so the next question I see that we

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:41,259
haven't touched on is anyone having

00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:44,769
success with selinux labels on our zero

00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:47,829
root filesystem is significant work is

00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:57,549
significant work policy work required to

00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:59,319
enable SC Linux and these are the

00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:02,020
questions where we need help from the

00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:05,219
audience okay so we have a hand up

00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,219
[Music]

00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:16,240
and once again please feel free to ask

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:21,520
in chat afterwards in case people are

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:23,590
having trouble with the platform so I

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,600
see boys and Makhan Singh the question

00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,210
you guys want to take to me come in and

00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:31,900
talk muck you know yet yeah I'll just

00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:33,310
talk briefly I was a maintainer for

00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,290
medicine Linux I may still be in the

00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:38,910
maintainer file that I've had no time in

00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:41,110
a while but generally speaking the

00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,030
expectation is that the SELinux

00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,530
infrastructure the support for the

00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,780
labeling all of that supposed to

00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,330
continue to work it's really down to the

00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,500
policy there is no standard policy so

00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,870
that is something that you'll have to

00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,200
develop yourself and it is not easy to

00:36:52,870 --> 00:37:02,520
do

00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:02,520
so keep that in mind okay thank you Mark

00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:10,510
okay so just looking at a time 37 38

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,770
minutes so we have something more time

00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:16,480
so how pretty more questions we come on

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,070
yeah what's happening nico is the guys

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,810
in chat are sort of answering the

00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,430
questions without opening their

00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:25,530
microphones and if we're looking at the

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,530
question list we can't see them chatting

00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,900
are you saying that they don't need us

00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,150
bypassing the system and making it a

00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,910
little bit tricky for us because we

00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:46,950
think nothing's happening and something

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:51,670
is so who has their hand up so this is

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:56,310
Hey hi Nico I would like to to repeat a

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:59,380
question from the ypg in your actually

00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:01,870
the question was is there anybody here

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:06,010
actually doing this for fun or as a

00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:07,870
hobbyist or are we all like doing this

00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:11,530
as professionals just to earn a living

00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:13,240
because that that's kind of like it's

00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:18,349
interesting whom we are actually working

00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:26,839
with that's a good question

00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:28,699
I see incised yeah so this bill is very

00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:30,849
much a hobby for me and I'm very I'm

00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:33,079
gonna do a lot of stuff on my own time

00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:35,420
absolutely nothing to do with my my

00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:39,349
employer but it's all still my day job

00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:41,959
so it's a lot of both and I think many

00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:44,059
of us actually fall into that camp most

00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:46,849
of us probably had more time and we were

00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,650
earlier in our careers and experimented

00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:51,920
more did more hobbyist

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:53,900
type things and just as life goes on it

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,619
you tend to get busier and busier and

00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,449
less at that time but yeah so you know I

00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:02,499
was working on 3d printer stuff and

00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:04,670
other things in the makerspace and I

00:39:02,499 --> 00:39:06,199
still have a lot of interest in like

00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,959
home automation and things like that

00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:18,019
like home assistant but it's just a

00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:21,259
matter of time oh yeah so I what did you

00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:24,650
say I use it in both realm so I have my

00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:29,630
home automation that is meant for a lot

00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:31,819
and stuff that there I use my grass

00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,969
berry pie as a gateway for my sprinklers

00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:37,279
and for my wash machine and stuff like

00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:39,859
entering the stuff that I use for them

00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:45,199
and professionally also a media project

00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:46,339
in the separate realm of things and and

00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,949
also I have interesting other

00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:51,529
architectures that doesn't matter

00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:53,900
professionally to my knee for example

00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:56,799
and just like those and I use the

00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,799
project for doing that

00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,190
okay I can see an interesting question

00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:10,180
here is there any super fun building and

00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:17,170
a symmetric multiprocessing SOC and if

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:20,020
so is that supported with ng mu so once

00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,970
you take this one and I guess we

00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,799
probably need to define asymmetric here

00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,980
but I'm going to assume it's like SOC

00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:32,289
with vials calls from different even

00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:34,390
different architecture maybe anybody

00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:44,789
wants to talk about that maybe multi

00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:46,779
config yeah hey yeah so you can do

00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:48,960
heterogeneous computing with multi

00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:53,650
config where you can compile different

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,420
parts of the system for different

00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:58,380
architectures even so that would be like

00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:02,349
your main cores or arm and your

00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:05,109
secondary cores or AVRs or whatever you

00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:07,539
want it doesn't need a little bit of

00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:12,510
work to get those toolchain set up but

00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:16,510
that is definitely supported there was a

00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:18,549
great talk from Microsoft I think it was

00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:21,160
ELC last year maybe is here last year

00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:24,630
and they explained how they actually

00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,220
build and use multi config to build a

00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:30,339
asymmetric systems for the algae's

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:33,579
affair so you might want to watch what

00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:36,609
they've done they did share like a lot

00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:42,309
of good tips and tricks about what they

00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:45,309
learned in the process so I think the

00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:48,220
part of the question was on qi mu and

00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:50,829
give me it's talk I don't think like you

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,440
can have in emulation in the same

00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:56,319
process so maybe I mean different CPUs

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,930
being emanating same process it will be

00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:01,000
in C if that was the case but I guess in

00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:03,460
new york like really looking to how the

00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,579
set of multiple key meaning instances

00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:08,980
perhaps run it but as far as building it

00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:11,549
concerned i think your project is all

00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,549
set for that

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,830
okay if any mainline can't do that

00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:48,130
okay I think we got most of that okay so

00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:59,180
is there any questions that we have nice

00:42:48,130 --> 00:43:01,070
thank you for liking my cat no no what

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:05,140
the sword order is on these cats who

00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:05,140
gives the questions thumbs up by the way

00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:16,280
yeah this ever anybody gonna build

00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:20,450
cushions and that I could change the

00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:23,140
order and assaulting yeah we're learning

00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,140
a lot today

00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,160
now can the attendees thanks Jennifer

00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:41,840
okay so do you have more questions we

00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:46,660
have a question maybe for you Jennifer

00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,660
is the audio going to be available after

00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,180
yeah each other I asked this question

00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,490
and so I think Jennifer we have two

00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,380
questions for you is the chats and the

00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:07,310
questions going to be call it somewhere

00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:12,890
and is this life going the video going

00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:15,850
to be available okay it will be a the

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:15,850
video would be on YouTube

00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:34,230
okay do you know if we'll have the chat

00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:36,510
available I think given the circumstance

00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,980
it was not too bad we already had more

00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,170
questions than we usually have at the

00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:42,390
ball store in the platform it's been

00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:49,050
almost working fine except with your

00:44:42,390 --> 00:45:02,970
child say about that any any more

00:44:49,050 --> 00:45:05,990
questions okay and if we have any you

00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:10,470
know follow-up questions we have the

00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:12,510
channel on slack and most of us should

00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,700
be around this week to help answer

00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:19,380
questions and try and clarify anything

00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:22,940
we didn't do oh here we have a good

00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:29,520
question in chat what can companies do

00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:31,230
to help the project so that's a very

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,770
interesting questions so there are many

00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:37,020
different answers I'm the first and

00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,910
obvious one is actually to go and join

00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:42,210
the project the Yocto project that will

00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:44,280
actually provide resources and I and

00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,140
help set the directions for min doctor

00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,470
project and open empathy technologies I

00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,680
mean that one is obvious but I mean

00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:53,670
obviously having your engineers

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,320
contribute to the project you don't have

00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,869
to be a member but she contributed

00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Center cheese so definitely contribute

00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:02,849
your use case I mean sending badges is

00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,160
one thing but also what we what we

00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:07,080
figure out in this version is both we

00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,660
are meeting users of the project that we

00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:13,050
don't talk to in sometimes you guys do

00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,730
things that we didn't think about so in

00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,080
we don't all the use cases so sharing

00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,869
your use case with us

00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:22,430
joining the mailing list and sending

00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:25,710
patches I mean obviously is something

00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:27,060
reporting bugs are testing master or in

00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,740
our that we are the LTS I mean

00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,720
contributing to the LTS is also

00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,190
something things that a company can do

00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,140
very often we see

00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,630
and we hear that when we actually go

00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,510
home into Evitts people just go and they

00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,579
get grown this thing and they go and

00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,619
they use it and they don't necessarily

00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,869
contribute even if they fix issues

00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:47,880
sometimes I mean they just fix issues on

00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:49,950
their own and don't set back so just

00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,539
contributing back the fixes and the

00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:56,670
improvements you do on your on your side

00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:57,599
would be a tremendous help on test cases

00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:00,569
yes

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,030
testing that's a good thing ham we are

00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:05,579
relying more and more on automation for

00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:07,440
testing like a mean face I think we gave

00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:09,329
some numbers but we're gonna or close to

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,369
to millions of tests where you do a full

00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:13,170
test and it's all to make it so it's

00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:14,940
it's many tests I mean self tests for

00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:18,270
the system but also on pts follow

00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,250
recipes so and more testing I mean that

00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,140
we have means that we can catch issues

00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:24,030
more often hand in quicker so that's

00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,859
that's always good so testing things in

00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:29,640
such a way that we don't test and assess

00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:31,619
who knows nice okay yeah I wanted to

00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,930
take this tool is available for anyone

00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:36,750
to run tests on their environment in

00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:40,650
report that result I think that would be

00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:45,359
a create how have their devices perhaps

00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:48,150
that they can test or they can run tests

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:52,349
on and report back perhaps that would be

00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:57,390
helpful and participation generally not

00:47:52,349 --> 00:47:59,549
only in code but also otherwise there

00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:02,720
are various other aspects of project you

00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:07,260
know starting from marking and

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,299
documentation in one technical aspects

00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,329
the project as well documentation

00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:15,119
perhaps that even got out there as well

00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:18,589
so obviously letting our engineers but

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:23,660
upstream that is one week day to

00:48:18,589 --> 00:48:23,660
contribute and also in finished product

00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:31,500
Ayten I mean how many good suggestions

00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:36,859
from which also I hope to get them but

00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,859
helping us Randy

00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:50,909
[Music]

00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:08,079
thanks.thanks so Andy but that's what

00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:10,880
the Bugzilla I should mention that

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,950
Bugzilla is the the back system we use

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,960
so every most of the change we do we try

00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:17,480
to use Bugzilla so if you can also have

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:23,569
your engineers label issues and help us

00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:26,750
on Bugzilla would be something on the

00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:27,980
day-to-day if you talk to each other on

00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:30,200
the day-to-day I mean they are issues

00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,930
every day that just come and pop so

00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,599
there are two meetings every week where

00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:37,400
the team called the community comes

00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,349
together I mean there is the technical

00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,910
meeting where they talk about the stages

00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:42,950
of the project and what's going on and

00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,839
what's going to be worked on and there

00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:47,390
is a triage for triage meeting where I

00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:49,940
mean people can join and help basically

00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,589
looking at bugzilla and and finding what

00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,200
other ladies shoes and doing some bug

00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:55,789
triage so again I mean you don't have to

00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,470
send patches you don't have to be a

00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:59,329
member to do all these things that we do

00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:01,720
cami you can help the project in many

00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,720
different ways

00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:14,630
let me have a look right there is a new

00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:17,539
testing manual which is actually been

00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:19,430
written like a week ago finalized a week

00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:22,160
ago so if you want to help what if you

00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:24,589
want on the same test that the project

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,700
is actually it's actually now they're

00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:27,700
well documented process

00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:50,790
we got a couple more questions I can

00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:53,250
find them if she thinks about Microsoft

00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:55,920
they actually have made a few talks

00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:57,540
annex and they explain what if what they

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,220
do with the Yocto project and why they

00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:02,130
use it so that can give you some hints

00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:07,110
about why they've Jerry I think I liked

00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:11,970
one of them as one of the answers ah

00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:19,590
someone put a little notification there

00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:21,660
was more questions someone is asking if

00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:26,850
we can replace Bugzilla with something

00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:30,290
better so I don't know if hey Charlie

00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,290
you want to say something about this one

00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:39,110
what's better these days that's sort of

00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,110
a general question

00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,030
don't mention close source software

00:51:51,789 --> 00:52:05,170
there may have been some questions but I

00:51:53,470 --> 00:52:07,510
can't find them so I'll just say there

00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:13,440
is a migration of Bugzilla to a new

00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:13,440
version of Jesus plan for the short term

00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:19,630
any questions on the question tabs so

00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:23,460
Paul Barker has a gitlab instance

00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:28,089
running if people want to play with that

00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:30,039
someone mentioned gitlab yeah that's

00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:33,069
correct actually this is a we have

00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:35,680
gitlab de comes slash openembedded if

00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:38,230
you don't fight it lets me offline and

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,819
then I can point you that's a place I

00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:42,760
mean if some people have asked for like

00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:46,270
hosting open embedded layers on it lab

00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,490
so we set up the main namespace

00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:51,010
open-ended so anybody is feel free to

00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,630
come to us and ask I mean and we would

00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:54,250
just make any project and if they want

00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:57,490
to experiment with using get life for

00:52:54,250 --> 00:53:01,680
the layers that's possible to do that on

00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:04,000
the opportunity to get lab yeah and I

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,369
when I set up the metal pipe on few

00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,069
layer I had to do an automation and II's

00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:11,410
collabs di for that so I put that link

00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:13,779
in earlier but if anybody has any

00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:16,480
questions about the approach that I took

00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:21,250
for that I mean I'm mostly copy actually

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:30,750
from his name now but a guy over in well

00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:36,849
containment but yeah old functional

00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:39,069
things like docker container and maybe

00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:41,650
I'll see you know fair amount at work

00:53:39,069 --> 00:53:48,329
like moving the entire project to that

00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:48,329
it's just there's a lot of made from

00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:57,490
okay Tim thank you all for coming

00:53:54,059 --> 00:54:00,010
any final words Nico

00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:02,560
yeah I mean thanks everyone takes to

00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:05,320
using this platform and

00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,030
having yesterday thank you and again we

00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,850
are going to be on slack for the last

00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:13,480
week and we are reading this on IRC I

00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:17,800
mean for the rest of the year we also

00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:19,360
have a yacht slack channel as well as

00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:22,240
the embedded one but most of us watch

00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:24,670
both of them yeah that's that's not the

00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:27,070
Yocto slack we are using the conference

00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:29,500
main slack server and we have a channel

00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,480
there we usually don't use like I mean

00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:38,050
it's actually a good question whether we

00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:46,000
should have one discuss or awesome

00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:49,360
things similar okay so thanks everyone

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,860
wherever you how I mean have a good rest

00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,830
of the day and good morning good

00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:54,670
afternoon good night and enjoy the rest

00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:58,290
of the conference

00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,290
