hello and welcome to

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,559
training the next generation of open

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,360
source developers my name is jeremy and

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,040
i'm the

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
director of technical community at

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,600
datadog if you have any questions or

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,400
want to follow up after the talk

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
hit me up at linuxquestions on twitter

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,240
and i'd like to this to be

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
as interactive as possible so don't be

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,680
shy i know we are pre-recording this but

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
i'll be there for the live qa

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,679
and have left plenty of time for you to

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
ask questions at the end

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719
and would love for you to implement a

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
program similar to this at your

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
organization when this is over so

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,040
would like to answer any questions that

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,120
you may have along the way

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,960
with that said let's get started so what

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,559
is datadog and i do want to note here

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,320
that this is in no way a product pitch

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,840
in any way shape or form

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,920
but the product really is part of the

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
story so having just a little bit of an

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,199
understanding of what the product is

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,039
will really help you understand the

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,399
storyline so

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,879
now we're a platform for modern

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,359
analytics and monitoring and designed to

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,559
help you understand your entire stack

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,920
especially if you're in the cloud but

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,960
even if you're on a more traditional

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,119
infrastructure

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,799
and just to give you a little bit of the

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,680
idea of the scale that we're at we're

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,520
processing

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
trillions of data points a day so

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,600
solving really interesting problems

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,600
at scale

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
and there you go we think of our

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,280
services

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,960
as enabling observability through a

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,720
variety of tools that are built on top

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,000
of our platform so you have

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,280
your traditional infrastructure

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,119
monitoring and metrics you have

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
distributed tracing and apm

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,240
you have logs you have synthetics and

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
we've recently added

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
additional features such as networking

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000
and rum and security so a very

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,399
comprehensive platform to enable

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,360
enable observability and you might

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,600
commonly

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,600
hear these called the pillars of

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
observability within the industry

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,520
so that should give you a little bit of

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,000
an idea of what we do as a product

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,600
so with that this is usually a slide

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,520
that you see at the end we're hiring and

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,119
while we really are hiring

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,439
the reality is that even in these

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,439
difficult times many tech companies are

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,119
accelerating their hiring and in the

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,280
long term i think in the technical

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,720
industry recruiting is always going to

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,599
be a difficult problem

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,800
uh so normally this is where i'd say hey

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
raise your hand if you're not hiring

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
can't do that here but i think you get

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,680
the idea

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,120
and and the reality beyond that is we're

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
all using open source

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
sometimes i have to explain that a

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,080
little bit obviously here at open source

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,840
summit i don't think that i need to

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,480
right open stores at this point

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,000
is just table stakes but the more we

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,160
talked to candidates that were coming

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,080
out of university we realized that

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,080
they actually didn't have solid open

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
source experience they didn't understand

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
the fundamentals of open source

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
they didn't have the philosophical

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,959
interest that many developers have had

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
in the past

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
and they just didn't also didn't have a

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
lot of observability experience but

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,640
on the open source side we found that

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
this really made roles focused on open

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,800
source

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,800
really challenging to hire for

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,519
especially at the more junior side of

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
the scale

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
and that's something that we wanted to

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,920
directly address

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
so with that in mind i want to set up a

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,120
little bit about how open source works

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,640
at datadog

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,640
so we are a proprietary sas product

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,840
but like most companies these days we

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,000
have a huge

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,800
huge focus on open source and i'm going

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,319
to explain that a little bit more

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,480
so all of our agents all of our

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,840
libraries anything basically that runs

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,360
on your infrastructure

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,959
is going to be completely open source

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,599
for us so typically it's going to be

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
apache 2 but we also have some bsd and

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
some mit

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,720
as well but we also in addition to all

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,799
of that being open source

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,640
we release quite a bit of open source

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
based on problems that we've sold

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,799
internally so one example of this is

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,280
kafka kit which we open sourced last

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,040
year

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,879
and that's a great example it's some

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,599
tooling that enabled us to scale kafka

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
really well

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,720
and we found a large community growing

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,879
around that so

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,560
not only uh releasers of open source as

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
far as the product goes but also some

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,640
additional tooling as well

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,319
beyond that we rely on a ton of open

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,680
source and i'm sure this is the same

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,439
with your organization

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
you know i've kind of highlighted kafka

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,280
and kubernetes and postgres go here

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,799
if i try to include the logo for every

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,519
open source project that we use

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,239
realistically

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,879
it would not be a readable slide but

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,560
like i said

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,720
i imagine this is the same for your

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,040
organization increasingly open source is

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
just

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
important for everyone we also

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,400
contribute upspring upstream where it

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,880
makes sense

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,720
so whether that is helping others scale

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,080
as we've scaled or making things more

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,240
observable for the project

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,320
or just regular bug fixes performance

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,639
improvements we very much have an

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,080
upstream first mentality as you should

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
too

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,759
beyond just open source though we

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,600
believe in open standards as well

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,520
so we recently is an example here

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,199
contributed all of our tracers and auto

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,919
instrumentation to the open telemetry

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,600
project

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,960
for those of you not familiar with open

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
telemetry they provide

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,240
you know libraries agents and other

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,160
components that you need to capture

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,280
telemetry data for your services

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,040
and that's going to give you better

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,960
observability allow you to manage things

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
better allow you to debug things better

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,080
and it was the result of the merging of

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,720
two open source projects

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
open tracing and open census so across

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
the board

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,880
the the point here is that we are huge

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,320
supporters of open source and open

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
standards and it's really important to

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,400
us that we are good open source citizens

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,160
throughout that one last thing i should

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,759
note here if you are an open source

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,720
project and you don't currently have an

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,800
observability solution we do offer free

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,280
absolutely no strings attached no charge

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
uh data dog two open source projects

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,560
and this runs again it's a program that

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
we started a few years back then i

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
currently

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,199
lead and we everything from apache

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
software foundation and python software

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,080
foundation so large

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,080
foundations we donate to also all the

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,280
way down to very small projects so

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,199
if this is a need that you have and

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
you're an open source project do

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,199
contact me and let me know and we're

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,520
happy to help you out there

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,199
so with open source at datadog and why

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,759
the this is important to us out of the

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,160
way

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,440
let's i would like to cover just briefly

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
a little bit about me

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
and why i think you should listen to to

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,240
this talk

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,160
i consider myself an ardent but

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,520
realistic open source advocate and i

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,680
think that realistic part is

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,280
is really important but beyond the

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
principles of open source that i do

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,520
genuinely believe in i also recognize

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,080
that open source has accelerated my

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,080
career

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,600
you know i started using linux in the

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,280
very early days

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,840
ironically a little bit looking for a

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,560
sco alternative

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,440
i founded a website called

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,240
linuxquestions.org which is the largest

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,479
distribute

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
distribution independent linux community

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,360
on the web

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
it has been you know a really fun ride

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,199
we're gonna in the next week or so here

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
hit our 20-year anniversary so something

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,600
that

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,280
i've been doing for a while i was an

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
early podcaster mostly around open

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,600
source and in technology in general

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,960
but i think most importantly probably

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,479
for this particular talk

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,560
i'll leave the open source programs

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,479
office at datadog

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,080
and the reality here is my life would be

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
very different if it weren't for open

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,440
source and as i talked

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
to other people in the organization i

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
realized that there was quite a few of

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,639
us that felt the same way

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,319
and we kind of wanted to pay it forward

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,599
and ensure that other engineers and

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,520
newer engineers

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
had the same opportunities that we have

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,680
and could be positively impacted by open

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,599
source

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
so one of the first things we did is

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,120
good open source citizens we looked

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,840
around to see what other organizations

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,599
were there

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,120
and same with code there's no reason to

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,400
start something from scratch if you can

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,199
build on something that's already

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,280
existing

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
i've put a couple examples in the slide

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,360
here outreachy summer of code

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,120
osl and the the reality here is these

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,800
are all great projects we actually still

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
participate in some of them

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
but for what we were specifically trying

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,360
to do here they just weren't a fit for

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,639
that so

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,039
we did decide to launch something new

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,039
so what we launched was the datadog open

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,080
source co-op program

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,319
this is typically a 15 to 20-ish week

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,280
paid internship and that's an important

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
part of this is

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,800
they get full remuneration full benefits

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,400
the same as if they were a full-time

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
employee at the organization

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,599
so they are there's not like a different

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,800
tier for them they are full

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,440
employees and that's very important

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
so what did they actually do so one of

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
their main goals

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,400
is specifically to work on upstream open

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,919
source projects

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,440
and i'm going to get into a little bit

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
of the details there and i'll explain

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,840
why

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
i've included these logos in a few

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,160
minutes

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,639
so the main goal is to identify

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,160
report and then fix performance issues

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,680
and meaningful bugs

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,599
in open source projects and do that

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
upstream we skew towards what we

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,000
consider

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,759
impactful projects and and how we kind

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,520
of define that internally are

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
things that are technically interesting

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
for the co-op which is really important

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,800
but also things that we use as an

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,719
organization so that's

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,719
where you get the benefits to both sides

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,039
after that we write about the experience

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,120
on our engineering blog and we found

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,040
that written communication skills are

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
vastly under appreciated by new

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,080
engineers

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,760
a skill that i think is super important

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,839
it helps you clarify your thoughts

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,360
helps you solidify lessons learned it

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,279
also enables you to share

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
all things that i think are super

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,560
important

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,920
the key difference between some of the

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,000
other programs though here is we wanted

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,519
to make it relevant to the business

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,880
so that we could make it sustainable

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,360
something that we could do long term

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,440
something

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,519
that we could do at scale and so we have

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,279
them do this all with datadog the

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,000
product

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,880
so if this is going to be successful a

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
core

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,320
piece really is that it has to be

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
beneficial for the students and really

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,040
meaningful

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,800
meaningfully beneficial so what does

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,320
that mean in practice

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,160
some of the benefits that i'll cover

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,200
they gain real world experience in

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,880
engineering

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,880
that's publicly referenceable and i

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
think that last part is what's truly

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,120
important you know there's a lot of

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
great internship opportunities around

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,399
but a lot of times what happens is

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,279
you're going to say i work at i worked

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,519
at company x

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,360
and worked on project y and that's about

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,279
all the details that you can give

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
where in the case of our internship here

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,000
because it is all open source it is all

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
upstream

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,920
you can say i worked on project x here

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,680
are the pr's that i submitted

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,959
so not only can you see my technical

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,040
solution

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,480
you can see how i responded to review

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
code reviews you can see

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,399
how i interacted with other people you

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,000
can see how my thought process iterated

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
as i got more and more involved

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
so it's a pretty comprehensive picture

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
of what you worked on

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,560
all publicly referenceable which we

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
think is a pretty unique benefit that we

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,519
haven't seen

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,360
a lot elsewhere you're going to learn

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,839
about what open source is

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,440
and why it's important and it's a huge

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,120
huge piece of that you're going to see

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,800
how do you engage with open source

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,560
communities you know open source

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,720
communities especially some of them have

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
a little bit of a reputation for being

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
a little bit intimidating and having

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
someone that is familiar with that

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,399
community to mentor you through the

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,839
process

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,920
has been really critical for this

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,560
program and has been a huge benefit

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,000
directly to the students and the last

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,760
thing i'll cover there as a student

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
benefit is you build your reputation in

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,880
the open source community

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
and this has a couple of knock-on

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,800
benefits one is it just straight makes

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
you more employable in the long term

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,240
which is obviously huge

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,519
but on the other hand it also allows you

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
to work with a bunch of different

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,480
projects to see what type of projects

00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,839
resonate with you

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,839
and just importantly what kind of

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,000
projects don't

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,959
now the other side of that coin is it

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,720
has to also be

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,160
beneficial to the organization if it's

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,120
going to be sustainable for the long

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,040
term so

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,160
what what benefits is data dogs seen and

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,839
why are we doing this

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,320
well one that raises our open source

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,399
profile as i said we use a ton of open

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
source we release a ton of open source

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,839
we want to be good open source citizens

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,200
and genuinely give back to a community

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,240
that's given us a lot

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,240
and this enables us to do that

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
it allows us to i guess pardon the pun

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,880
dog food our own products and what i

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,519
mean by that is

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,000
a lot of co-ops come out especially

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,200
where

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
waterloo and some of the other

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,440
organizations that we work with closely

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,720
are great engineering schools the people

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,240
that come out of them are super

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
technical and have a lot of technical

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
skill

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
they don't have a lot of open source

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,959
skill like i said and they might not

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,279
have a bunch of observability

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,959
experience so if they're running into

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,880
onboarding problems with our product

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,320
it's very likely that other customers

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
are also running into those same

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
onboarding

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,959
issues so having someone that we can

00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,519
work with to identify those problems and

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
solve them

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,079
has been really beneficial for us as

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,320
well and lastly the recruiting pipeline

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,880
and there's kind of two things that i'll

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
mention very briefly here one is the

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,360
obviously we hope to

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,279
recruit the people that are going

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,320
through this co-op program but in

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,920
addition to that

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,440
it also allows us to show the great

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,920
things that we're working on and

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,360
kind of expose our culture to a bunch of

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,639
open source product projects

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,880
and that also helps us with that

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,320
recruiting pipeline so two benefits

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,240
there

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,160
so now that i've covered i think why

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,880
this is comprehensively beneficial to

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,040
everyone

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,120
i want to get into a case study this one

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,360
involving andrew mcburney

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,959
so he is from waterloo which is one

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
organization that we work with quite a

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,600
bit

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,519
and before he joined as a co-op as part

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,440
of this program he had a little bit of

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,200
experience in the open source world

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
had kind of looked at a couple projects

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
but he really wanted to dig in and learn

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,360
more

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,959
he joined us in his junior year in 2018

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,639
and as the first co-op as part of this

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,000
program he would need to prove that the

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,600
concept was viable

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
that it was beneficial to him that it

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,279
was beneficial for the organization and

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
really that we should continue doing

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,560
this long story

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
long term and uh happy to say the story

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,839
has a happy ending

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,519
he uh we still have the program and he

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,880
actually works at datadog full-time as

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,880
an engineer now so

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,880
all the way around the story ends well

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,040
so as i mentioned part of the

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
objective of this is to find meaningful

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,360
performance or bugs

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,839
or issues uh use datadog to find and fix

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,200
that

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,200
and then get that fixed not only

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
submitted but accepted upstream

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,639
so andrew identified a performance issue

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,320
in homebrew

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,279
and for those of you who use homebrew

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,760
specifically in the linkage command

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,720
now here is the part of the pr that he

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,839
initially submitted

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,000
aside from the fact that you can see

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
here andrew is very canadian one great

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,639
thing here is that we use data

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,000
brew internally at datadog quite a bit

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,800
so this is where i was mentioning

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
there's a direct

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,399
impact to us but also something that we

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
can share with the broader open source

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,880
community

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,680
so here is a flame graph from brew

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
linkage before andrew submitted the pr

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,480
and here is

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,440
the pr this is a excuse me this is a

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,600
flame graph from after the pr was

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
merged it's a little difficult to tell

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
here exactly what's happening you can

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,079
tell there's an improvement but let me

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,639
get into some specifics

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,279
so with no caching at all brew linkage

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,839
took roughly eight seconds to run

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,000
now he initially used sqlite but this

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,880
introduced an additional dependency into

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
the project

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,560
and there's something that the project

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,279
did not like and this was a great lesson

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
learned for him

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,720
and something that we mentored him

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,199
through after the fact that you need to

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,199
really

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,120
before you just start submitting a pr to

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,800
a new open source project

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,560
you need to understand what their norms

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,320
are i kind of explained it as you should

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,040
participate a little bit in read-only

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,639
mode first

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,560
this was something that was documented

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,880
so had he looked around a little bit

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
more

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,839
it's something that he would have

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,560
discovered and something that i think it

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,920
was an actionable takeaway for him

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,160
but moving to the solution that was

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,839
actually accepted which was based on dbm

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,720
and did not introduce any additional

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,720
dependencies

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,399
you can see here that it took about a

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,680
tenth of a second longer to run on the

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
first time and that's of course while

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,519
the cache is being built

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,240
but subsequent runs are quite a bit

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,720
faster

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,880
on the order of 200 milliseconds so

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,040
quite a performance win

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,560
now with that pr accepted and merged

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,320
it's time to write about the experience

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,839
in the solution for our engineering blog

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
which was where we share a lot of our

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
engineering stories

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,920
with the broader community now one thing

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,079
that was interesting to me here is that

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,279
andrew enjoyed this process much more

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,800
than he anticipated

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,399
and he actually noted that learning

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
about the importance of writing was one

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,959
of the biggest surprises of his time

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,519
here at datadog

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,600
and i kind of underscored the importance

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,199
of written communication skills before

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,279
and how underappreciated they are

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,959
so this for me was personally very

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,480
satisfying and i thought it was great

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
that it was something that he took with

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
him

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,199
and i'm quite sure will benefit him for

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,120
the rest of his career

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,800
so what else did he work on so you'll

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,680
probably recognize d

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,519
graph you might recognize fast plane but

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
what is jello

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,600
so the great thing about jello is it's

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,519
internal tooling that we've open sourced

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,279
but the part that i really like is

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,040
it's something that andrew identified as

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,399
an inefficiency in our internal

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,639
processes

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,480
he worked on his own across teams to fix

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,000
it and then released it as open source

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
so the resulting trello github

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
integration

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,560
is now i know being used at other

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
organizations which is great to see

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
also something that's interesting is

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,120
other co-ops after him have also worked

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,199
on it

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,880
and actually our co-op right now ursula

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,639
is porting it to jira which is something

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,320
a change that we've made internally

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,079
so it's great to see both a community

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,240
starting to form around it and

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,680
subsequent co-ops also working on it to

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
give the program a little bit of

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,519
continuity there

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,040
so what did he learn one

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,120
how to interact with upstream

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,680
communities and as i've kind of said

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,759
earlier in this talk some open source

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,240
communities especially have a reputation

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,920
for

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,600
you know being a little bit intimidating

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,519
but even the super

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,040
welcoming ones and there are many if

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,759
you're new to it and haven't done it

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
before

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,120
it's something that you're not going to

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,799
really know the ins and outs and having

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,319
a mentor to walk you through

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,160
here's the technical part of it here's

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,679
the people part of it all the different

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,480
aspects that are involved with open

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,679
source

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,199
having someone to mentor you through

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,199
that product was something that he

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,280
really took away from this

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,439
now he of course he learned a ton about

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,679
modern microservices distributed systems

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,679
modern infrastructure cloud et cetera

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,039
like i said we're solving a lot of cool

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,799
problems at scale

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,080
and him having production experience

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,280
there and we

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,520
we do kind of throw you right into

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,880
production is something that he a lesson

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,000
learned and something that he was able

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,280
to take away

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,480
this is a small one he learned an

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,919
additional programming language

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,840
obviously if you know a couple learning

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,280
an additional one is not a huge thing

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,440
but it was something that he said he

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,640
enjoyed the process of especially under

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,320
the conditions that

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,480
the program facilitated the importance

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,240
of making data-driven decisions and and

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
this was a big one i know data is in our

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,400
name and we are a very data-driven

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,000
company

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,919
and i showed you a little chart in a

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,760
couple flame graphs but the amount of

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,280
data he used to iterate on the different

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,440
solutions as he was working through the

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,760
technical side of this problem was huge

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,280
and it's something that he noted uh that

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,840
was a huge takeaway for him

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,280
was how important making those data

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,480
driven decisions were and not just

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,520
saying i think this is going to be a

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,840
better solution

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,280
but actually proving not only is it a

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,360
better solution this is how much of a

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,799
better solution it is and having numbers

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,400
to back that up his next co-op actually

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,240
ended up being working on one of the

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,960
projects that he contributed to while at

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
datadog

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,760
so this isn't maybe specifically a

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,440
lesson learned but something that he was

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,799
really happy with and a takeaway from

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,240
the program

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,600
and the last thing he learned is the

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,640
importance of a positive work

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,320
environment i think

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,000
you know this is really a great place to

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,840
work we have a really great culture

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,080
and he noted that it was something that

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,280
he didn't realize how important that was

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
and as he was

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
was exposed to some other places he

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,160
realized that it was

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,080
something super important to him

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,760
personally and identified as one of the

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,280
reasons that he joined us full time

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,440
about a little over a year later so

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,360
with that out of the way i want to cover

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
some of the challenges and by challenges

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,559
i want to cover

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,600
challenges for him challenges for us as

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,679
an organization

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,640
and some challenges for the program

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,840
itself

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,600
so i'm going to lump these into some

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,760
broader categories the first one i'll

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,520
lump into what i'll call onboarding

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
and so andrew went through the same

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,360
onboarding as all engineers do here

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,120
i identified earlier that we were

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,480
finding that folks coming out of these

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,600
work didn't have the open source

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,400
experience that maybe we would like

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,240
but we i think we under appreciated just

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,160
how much of an additional crash

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,080
crash course they would need on the open

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,000
source side something that we've since

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,679
identified and are much better about

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,559
in subsequent coops but something that

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,559
you can learn from us

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,520
another challenge is working through the

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,360
what i'll call the vagaries of different

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,640
open source projects in the communities

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,440
that he was interested

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,120
in as i said every open source community

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,840
is going to be a little bit different

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,120
and mentoring him through that was just

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,640
generally a challenge

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,000
certainly not one that's insurmountable

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,559
one that you will definitely come up

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,159
against

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,559
and just more of something that you

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,559
should definitely be aware of

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,760
now the last one i'll cover as part of

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,440
onboarding is

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,960
helping him understand the value of the

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,720
program to the organization

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,360
this is one that i'll be honest we did

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,039
not anticipate in any way shape or form

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,480
but we have a lot of co-ops from

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,080
waterloo and a lot of his other

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,400
you know he was friends with some of

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,880
them as they were submitting prs to the

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,280
product

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,159
itself it was a more clear here's a

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
direct line i'm

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,760
i'm committing to the project i'm sorry

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,960
to the product where he was working on

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,159
upstream open source

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,919
he didn't really have a good

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,919
understanding and we didn't do a good

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,080
job to be frank explaining to him

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,159
why this program was super beneficial to

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,480
us as an organization not just to him

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,840
once we were able to explain that to him

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,720
and he really understood it

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,280
it recharged him completely morale shot

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
way up

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,120
and he would under once he understood it

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,720
he was super happy and continued with it

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,240
but so something that you should be

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,120
aware of if you're going to implement

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,200
this at your organization

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,039
the next group that i'll cover i'll lump

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,559
into setting expectations and this is

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,280
going to kind of become a recurring

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,000
theme

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,600
right after he joined he we sat down

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,039
with him and he discussed kind of a list

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
of things that he was interested in from

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,559
a technical perspective

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,840
projects that he had identified based on

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,520
us telling him what he was going to be

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,320
doing that he might be interested in

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,799
working in

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,640
and the thing to understand here is

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,840
they're going to be optimistic

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,960
possibly wildly optimistic your job is

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,280
to be realistic

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,080
so if they want to work on kubernetes as

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,400
a whole or

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,919
rails as a whole probably not a great

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,600
fit given the time constraints and

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,200
complexity of those projects

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,880
a lot of eyes on those projects a lot of

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,919
people working on them so what you need

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,600
to do is set

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,240
realistic goals and that's really really

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,919
important

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,840
so setting those expectations both in

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,720
terms of those goals but defining what

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,200
success is

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,200
is really important for a co-op program

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,919
waterloo is a specific example

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,720
has a very rigorous rubric for grading

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
their co-ops

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,919
and if they don't understand exactly

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,200
what success looks like they're not

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,159
going to understand how they're graded

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,520
which is going to be

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,280
terrifying for them given how the

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,760
program works so we wanted to make sure

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,480
we

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,200
he understood okay here's what you'll

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,120
the kind of the

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,120
what success looks like for you and

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,280
here's how you actionably attain that

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,679
success

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,720
the next things challenges i'll lump

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,600
into what i call

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,159
false starts so even if you put in the

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,720
work

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,360
to pick a project well some projects

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,960
that may

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,960
initially seem like they're going to be

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,880
a good fit for a variety of

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,159
reasons may end up not being as good a

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,000
fit as you would hope for

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
and this might be the issue that you

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,799
identified and you wanted to fix was

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,919
fixed by someone else before you were

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,000
able to submit it

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,000
it might be a problem that seemed pretty

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
easy to fix ends up being intractable

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,080
especially with that time box that you

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,559
have the important thing to consider

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
here is

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,400
that's okay in fact you can use it as a

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,080
very good learning experience

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,400
but what's important here is that you

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,400
understand when to move on and allow

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
that co-op to time box that effort

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,520
realize that it's not going to happen

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,880
but it was a lesson learned

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,559
and that it's fine to move on

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,000
while i'm speaking of false starts go

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,320
bills

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
the next group of challenges i will lump

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,600
into maintainer and project

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,440
responsiveness so

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,640
one thing that we failed that is we

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,960
didn't work with

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,480
projects well enough ahead of time so

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,159
that they knew that this was coming

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
uh google summer of code for example

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
does a phenomenal job here and is

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,679
actually we've modeled how we handled

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,240
this now much more in that

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,799
frame but you projects aren't if they

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
don't know

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,159
that you have someone working on this

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,919
they're just not going to you know be

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,240
able to accommodate it a lot of times

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,440
based on how open source projects work

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,200
and part of that is

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,400
their timelines and your timelines

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,960
they're just not going to be aligned

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,960
right you have 16 or 20 weeks exactly

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,720
to do this that doesn't fit in with

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,039
their timelines or how they do sprints

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,520
or

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,159
how they do releases so very important

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,720
to reach

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,559
out to projects ahead of time let them

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,000
know how the program works let them know

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,440
that someone from the program is

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,360
interested in contributing

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,039
see what issues they think would be a

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,159
good fit for them to work on

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,919
and then work on those thing i'll

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,520
mention here is kind of the variance

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,600
of response times in open source

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
projects is high and it's not only high

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,360
from project to project

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,240
but it's high for specific projects

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,400
individually

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,240
over a time right so things within a

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,279
project may change maintainers move on

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
maintainers change

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,440
maintainers get busy so understanding

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
that it's going to be variant that's how

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,159
it is

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,440
that's just the reality of it baking

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,360
that into the

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,360
process is going to be super important

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,000
uh and lastly i'll cover length of

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,600
program getting everything done

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,440
in a compressed time frame can be

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
frustrating for the co-op and that's the

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,159
reality of it

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,679
so once again you're gonna have to be

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,240
super deliberate about

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,120
time boxing things because of that you

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,799
need to plan

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,880
very well and this is going to come

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,400
right back to setting expectations is

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,760
super important like i said there's a

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,279
theme here

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,720
if there's one thing you take away from

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,720
this the importance of setting

00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,840
expectations across the board

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
both with the co-op with the

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,600
organization with the program

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,840
critical absolutely critical to success

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,120
so with those challenges out of the way

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,120
i want to let you know

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,200
and give you some tips on how you can

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,799
apply this to your organization now

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,480
and some lessons learned along the way

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,120
so you can not make the mistakes that

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,840
we've already made

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,120
so number one and these are obviously

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
going to come directly from the

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
challenges that we faced

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,000
engage with maintainers and projects and

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
do this ahead of time

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,039
be super deliberate about explaining

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,120
what this

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,880
what your project is how much time you

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,840
have what your goals are as an

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,840
organization

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,200
make sure that it's a good fit for you a

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,279
good fit for the project

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,640
and then work together collaboratively

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,159
so that you're setting the co-op

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,320
up for success next

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
uh write the story as you go and this

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
one i think is really important and

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,320
probably going to be under appreciated

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
but

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,240
like i said writing the story down

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,240
written communication skills in general

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,520
help you clarify your thoughts help you

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,279
cement lessons learned

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,720
and really enables others to learn from

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,240
you which is the entire part of our

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,880
engineering blog and most engineering

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
blogs is

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,480
you want to share those stories but

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,440
doing it well takes more time than most

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,360
people realize

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
and i think starting early part of what

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,240
it does is ensures that you're

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,840
documenting things along the way so that

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,520
they're fresh in your mind

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,039
but also to be frank hopefully it

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,200
enables you to finish on time

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,960
and in andrew's case his post actually

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,600
wasn't published until after his co-op

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
ended

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,640
which is something that we worked very

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,640
hard to ensure didn't happen again

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,080
next the length of the program impacts

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,520
success directly

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,279
and we work with a lot of schools i've

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,120
mentioned obviously waterloo

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,240
specifically a few times we also work

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,840
with northwestern

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,520
we work with a couple universities in

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,080
europe and they tend to have

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,279
16 week or 20 week programs and we found

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,880
that that's enough time

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,960
to really really get something done and

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,279
dig into a couple of different projects

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,240
write about it get it posted etc we've

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,760
we've found that

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,279
some of the summer internships where

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,960
you're getting four or maybe even eight

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,600
weeks it's just not enough for a program

00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,360
like this

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,640
for our goals if your goals are

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,400
different it might be

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,400
that it fits but we've just found that

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,600
it is realistically not enough time

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,360
uh mentoring speaking of time takes time

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,279
especially you know at datadog we are a

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,919
pretty distributed organization

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,480
uh but helping a co-op evaluate a

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,399
project

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,840
then picking a project then mentoring

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,480
through the technical challenges that

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,559
they're gonna

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,919
run into the open source processes that

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,600
they're gonna run into the human

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,679
elements that they're gonna run into

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,960
all of this takes time so if you don't

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,799
have the time to do this well

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,320
realistically i would recommend you not

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,919
institute something like this but

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,720
hopefully you can make that time and do

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,960
it well

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,320
uh but it's just something don't

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,000
underestimate the time that it's going

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,360
to take for this to be a rewarding

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,440
experience for the co-op

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,520
and why i mention is this this is a

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,120
great great opportunity to get more

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,399
people involved in open source

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,159
what you don't want to do is do it

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,880
poorly and then sour people on open

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,559
source

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,200
you know that would just be i think an

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,760
opportunity lost

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
so in conclusion four students to date

00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,679
have finished the co-op program there

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
you see

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,279
andrew but also taylor shiva and chelsea

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,120
who

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,720
have gone through it i mentioned ursula

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,399
who's on the team now

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,679
currently working on a couple cool

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,039
things that hopefully we'll have some

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,679
prs for soon

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,840
but we've submitted dozens of prs across

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,080
dozens of different open source projects

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,279
all four co-ops have said that they've

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
really enjoyed it and found it

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,919
beneficial

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,440
they're all still interested in open

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,039
source which is something that's been

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,720
super satisfying for us as an

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,120
organization super

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,559
satisfying for me individually and i

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
think that you can implement something

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,760
like this

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,279
in your organization so as i said i've

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,840
left plenty of time

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,360
for questions and would love to hear

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,080
specific thoughts on how you might

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,679
implement it

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,120
if you're doing something similar to

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,799
this would love to hear your lessons

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,000
learned and we can learn and share

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,000
collaboratively together

00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
thanks

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,480
thank you for joining me for training

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,559
the next generation of open source

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,320
developers as i said my name is jeremy

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,240
and that was the story of how we

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,279
implemented an open source co-op program

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,720
at datadog

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,399
there was a couple of questions that

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,840
came in during the session that i

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,360
answered via text

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,080
if you do have any other questions i'll

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,760
give you a little bit of time to

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,360
thank you steve a little bit of time to

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,840
get them in but if not

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,960
as i is is on the slide here i'm at

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,799
linux questions

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,120
happy to help you in any way i can

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,039
implement this at your organization

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,679
once again an absolutely great way to

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,440
mentor and foster open source

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,720
amongst the next generation of

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,480
developers so

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,360
with that appreciate it and thanks again

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
for coming to the talk

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,480
a question from joe was do you have any

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,159
tips on the specific angle arguments

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,880
that should be used to get students

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,799
excited about open source so i think

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,240
there are a couple of different things

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,399
that you can

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,279
underscore and utilize that are in their

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,279
benefit there

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,559
one is open source is obviously a great

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,640
way to learn about different

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,840
technologies get exposed to

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,919
different programming languages

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,080
different methodologies see what

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,600
is happening in the industry but again i

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,880
think that one of the big things that i

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
would underscore to students

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,520
specifically because

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,760
that part is obviously broadly

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,399
applicable is that this is a way for

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,520
them

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,360
to work on projects and have the next

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,440
people that are going to be hiring them

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,279
be able to see how they deal with code

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,960
how they deal with code reviews how they

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,880
deal with interpersonal skills

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,640
how their thought processes iterate

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,000
these are all things that in any other

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,279
co-op program

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,200
if they weren't open source you would

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,720
not be able to showcase those things

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,720
so being able to almost have an open

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
source portfolio when you're going to

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,159
you know going through the hiring

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,840
process is going to be really critical

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,360
and something that multiple co-ops here

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,960
have said has been super beneficial to

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,640
them as they've gone through the process

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,640
so great question joe appreciate it

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,840
and once again i will upload the the

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,159
slides there uh which was the question

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,320
from from alpesh

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,840
uh so it looks like that is all the

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,519
questions we had once again if you think

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,159
of a question or are watching this on

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,399
replay

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,240
and would like to ask you questions hit

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,120
me up at linux questions and happy to

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:29,600
help you out

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:29,600
