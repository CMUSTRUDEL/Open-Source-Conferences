hi

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,679
there my name is denise cooper and today

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,280
i'm here to talk about change agency for

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:19,039
open source program officer people

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,800
um or ospo people as we say um before i

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
leave this interest line i'm going to

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,720
point out that my

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,279
twitter handle is up there at the right

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,400
in case you were live tweeting for me

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,719
and advanced to the foundation for the

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,520
opportunity to give this talk

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,120
all right so in the last slide and in

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,520
this one you'll notice that one of these

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,680
things is not like the others

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
i think that's how most people that work

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
in open source program offices feel

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,680
inside their companies because we're

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,800
typically doing something different than

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,000
the rest of the company

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,680
doing and so it requires kind of a

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,719
different mental attitude

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,359
and in a different approach in general

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
but um i'm going to be advocating not

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,399
just

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
to do your hospital work but to do work

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,199
that actually pushes in the direct

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,119
changing

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,119
the culture of the practice inside your

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,200
company because it makes your work so

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
much more interesting but it is also

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,040
kind of the reason that we're there

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,880
so open source is something that

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,960
unites us we believe in transparency

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,200
we believe in massive peer review we

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
believe that this way of working is the

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
better way of

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,680
of engineering and we also believe in

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
contribution and generally in leaving

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
the campground a little bit better than

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,920
we found it

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,479
but in order to be that person in

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,119
a corporation that has different beliefs

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,439
you

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,560
have a lot of intestinal fortitude

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,360
personal

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,159
ability to carry your beliefs forward

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,840
even in the face of criticism sometimes

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,040
so right now the world's

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,040
on fire and this is a better time

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,240
than ever before to be a change agent

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
because

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
changes on everybody's lips changes

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
where we're headed

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
um i will say that in my experience

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,800
revolutionary change

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
is rarely as effective as evolutionary

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,040
change

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,040
but you kind of need both you need the

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,520
revolution and then you need

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,760
the years after it to regroup and

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,599
institutionalize that change before the

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,120
next revolution

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,319
what we're seeing right now is another

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,879
step in the path to fixing some historic

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,400
wrong

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,080
hopefully um and here i'm talking of

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
course about black lives matter not

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,680
about

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
but um interesting that they're

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
happening at the same time

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,720
most of the tips i'm going to give you

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
will serve you through any kind of

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,720
crisis

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,879
uh global or local but um

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,560
it's just let's just acknowledge that

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,920
this is a great time to be a change

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
agent

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,200
most people think that leadership is

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,680
identifying

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,120
the shortest route to the change that

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,959
you're trying to get to

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
and then leading the company down that

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,640
straight path but

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
even some of the most famous uh

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,200
institutional change agents

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,720
um couldn't do this so for instance

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,120
steve jobs

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
had real ideas about how the new apple

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,599
was gonna work

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,760
but um getting a whole

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,120
company full of people to do exactly

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
what you wanted them to do

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,040
is is a trick you know it takes a while

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,519
so for most people

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,159
this um this path is not nearly so

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,040
straight

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,480
it feels to me more like a slalom like a

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,560
giant slalom

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,640
so you can see the course you can see

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,280
the turns coming

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,599
but the combination of velocity and that

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,599
day's

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,280
condition your condition as an athlete

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,080
means that every turn

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,239
so just a little bit exciting because

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,799
you might fall out of control

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,400
and it might really look like you're out

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
of control a lot of the time to the

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
outside world

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,439
so think of your job not as not as

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,959
leading down a straight path towards a

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,920
glorious future but more

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,519
like dodging those curves and getting to

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,280
the bottom of the hill in one piece

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
that's a little more accurate for change

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,000
agents

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,359
now the ospo as a construct

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,280
started out as a thing that lawyers did

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,639
and those of us that weren't but we

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,280
still worked in the hospital we were

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,639
kind of like

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,000
clerks to the lawyers and it was already

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,960
around fear of open source and a desire

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
to control the effects on the company

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,960
these days

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,160
most ospos are not that anymore in fact

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,280
we always kind of

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
we were more like this we're sort of you

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,800
know

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
boldly going into a new future and we're

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
also

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,520
very good-looking and multicultural

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,520
you'll notice um

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,600
but this is in our heads this isn't

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,919
necessarily how we're seen by the rest

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
of

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,720
of the company right although the leader

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
of an osbo it's great to cultivate

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,160
cultivate this feeling uh within your

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,199
team

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,800
um so there's the job of

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:11,120
of you know flying the the

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,919
starship and there's it further

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,919
icons represent four ospo efforts some

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,639
of them older some of them newer

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,880
where an open source program office uh

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,600
got together to actually affect change

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
in the world

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,639
and that's kind of what i'm advocating

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,960
for in this talk

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,240
so i'll go quickly through them the one

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,199
in the lower left there

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
that is the google summer of code which

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,840
was started by

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,080
the open source program office at google

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,320
it was definitely a step beyond what

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
they what their remit was

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,560
the bright idea that they could kill a

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,759
bunch of birds with the same stone

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,080
they could um increase people's

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,120
goodwill towards google in the open

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,199
source community

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,360
they could increase the size of the open

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,000
community by mentoring students

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,639
into famous projects they could get some

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
work done

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,759
for the projects they could preview

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
potential employees by watching

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,880
how those kids were working those those

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,160
uh

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,160
summer of code interns were working

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
within those projects so it just ticked

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,280
a lot of boxes

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,800
now it wasn't the smoothest road in the

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,160
world they got it all established

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
started and then they realized they

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
didn't know how to pay people around the

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,479
world and they had to sort of do that in

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
real time

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,759
but that's that's an ospo embroidering

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,280
on

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,280
the regular path and um it's my favorite

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,759
example but these others are great

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,600
a robot when that's outreachy and that

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,639
of course originally out of the gnome

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
foundation

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,680
which isn't exactly an ospo but most

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,240
open source foundations are kind of like

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,319
large independent ospos in a way so

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,280
that's stormy peters realizing she could

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,759
have an effect on the diversity of open

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
source

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,440
from where she was sitting just by

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,160
launching a program

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
and again it started small and grew over

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
time

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,880
and is now quite famous the one in the

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,840
upper left that is the

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
and that was a group of ospos getting

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,440
together

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,720
to write down what they were doing the

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,639
sort of best advice

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
best practices for how to run a

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,199
corporate effort

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,039
and before they did that work there

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
weren't a lot of road maps for people

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,680
that were finding themselves suddenly

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,160
respo

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,440
so that was very valuable work and then

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,000
the last one

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,720
with the mask on that is fast responders

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,560
and that was

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,639
started very recently um by my former

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,800
uh colleague dwayne o'brien

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,560
and some other folks who noticed that

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,759
open source projects would be

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,919
negatively impacted by the inability

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
conferences for instance and some other

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,479
difficulties are rising from the

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
pandemic

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,840
and so they raised a fund and you can

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,479
apply to it if your project has run into

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,879
trouble

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,039
directly because of the so there's four

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,039
examples for you of people sitting in

00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,840
their ospos thinking about how to change

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,280
the world

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,039
right this is the one that i have been

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,520
working on for the last five or six

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,120
years i started it while i was at paypal

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,960
running their ospo

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
this is my own personal version of the

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,919
logo for inner source

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,599
inner sources using source methods as

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,199
regular engineering methods inside

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,680
proprietary companies

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
i didn't invent this that i definitely

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,319
resurrected it

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,479
from relative disuse and um

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,319
this talk isn't really about that but i

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,039
i am making the point that i

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,519
i myself am a person who wants to do

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,640
more

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,039
than just run the ospo and um so here's

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,039
a quick

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,440
view of inner source commons if you're

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,760
interested in looking into it this is a

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,720
non-profit that we set we started last

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,279
year

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,120
as we were disassociating ourselves from

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,760
paypal and becoming more of our own

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,160
thing

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,240
and if you're interested in buying open

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,760
source methods inside of companies this

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
is a great place to start

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,160
you can also start by the information

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,920
i'll have on my last slide

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,680
but back to being an osbo change agent

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,519
at some point you're going to have to

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,279
dive off the cliff

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,000
there's gonna be a moment quite

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,800
comfortable when you're taking a risk

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,120
and you feel like you're taking a risk

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,120
but

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,399
it's also is gonna make you feel you

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,040
alive

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,080
it's probably worth using your appetite

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,839
for personal risk

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,640
in your in your job before you take this

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,160
jump

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,399
because you don't want to find out that

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,800
you can't handle after you jump

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,160
right so spending a little bit of

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,519
introspective time

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,399
making some time looking at your

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,480
finances looking at your

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
your prospects one of the pieces of it

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,120
that i always give

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,360
to change agents is always be

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,959
interviewing even if you're not planning

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
to leave the company you're working at

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,640
even if there are

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,440
reasons to stay it is worth knowing you

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,680
could leave

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
if everything fell apart it helps make

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,760
you braver

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,240
right so first of all think about your

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,760
own

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,320
personal assessment of risk and this

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,000
is a standalone module that i often

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,680
offer if this is of interest to you

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,079
contact me and we'll talk about how i

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,360
can

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,720
spend with you on this step

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,640
then you're going to have to go looking

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,360
for air cover

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
so are people who are more powerful in

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,440
the company

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,440
and um they will help you

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
fight the battles that you have to fight

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,200
at the top with their peers

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,040
people that are that are being

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
obstructed obstructionist about the

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
change you're trying to affect

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,399
are usually coming from a place of

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,959
misunderstanding or fear and they will

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,399
often listen to their peers more than

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,640
they will listen to you

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,160
but you may also occasionally in order

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
to make an omelet you have to break some

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,040
eggs

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,160
and it's really handy to have somebody

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,560
you can appeal to

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,839
who is going to keep you from the

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
chopping block

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,920
i will tell you that for the entire time

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,920
that i worked at sun until

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,600
well i was this year so for five and a

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,760
half of those six years

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
somebody tried to fire me every quarter

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,440
every quarter

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,560
and it was usually a lawyer but

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
something was a vp

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
or somebody else and it was super

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,440
helpful

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,440
that i was on a waltz into your office

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,200
basis with the top lawyer

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,200
with the uh ceo with the vp in my own

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,480
division and in a few other divisions

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,880
those friendships those connections

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
mean more than once so i highly

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,240
recommend that you find

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
some air cover it's also handy for

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,760
getting budget because those people

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
always have budget and you can often get

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,760
pieces of it

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,680
from them but then you also have to

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,200
think about the ground cover

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,320
this is a famous grand cover called red

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,279
clover

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,640
that is useful for fictition in your

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,160
depleted field

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,120
but i want you to think of each of those

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,440
little flowers as an individual person

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
who is at your level or maybe below your

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,760
level in the company

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,880
and is interested in the change that

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,399
you're trying to affect

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,800
because they can see that it's going to

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,720
make their lives better

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,880
this is a real phenomenon and in fact i

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,079
know of at least one of these guys who

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,279
completely changed

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,320
a fortune 80 name brand company on his

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,120
own

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,160
and i'll talk about how later it's

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,800
possible to

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,360
be a groundling and change the company

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,600
it's just

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,040
more lift but if you're in an ospo

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,880
you're not a ground leader you're

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,240
you're perceived as a manager at least a

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,800
middle manager

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,160
and so you want to bring these people

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
along with you because they're going to

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,880
be your willing

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,120
helpers as you enact change

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,920
there's the middle i've been reading i

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,160
read a lot

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,560
of books about management as people you

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,320
know develop thoughts on it and

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,200
um this of the frozen middle

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
is thinking about what the role of the

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,880
middle manager

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,200
is most middle managers are working hard

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,800
to maintain the status quo

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,720
usually they're very interested in

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,320
keeping the people that work with them

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,800
employed but they're also um just

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,399
naturally more likely to try to defend

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
the current castle than to

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,639
embrace the change that you're talking

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,320
about now it's not a blanket statement

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,600
you will find middle managers who will

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,760
be helpful to you

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,240
but you're more likely going to have to

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,680
work around or through them with the

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,120
help of your air cover and your ground

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
cover

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
and i've been accused of maligning

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,560
middle managers unfairly

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
but my experience is they mostly see

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,760
your

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,279
projected change as a dumpster fire

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,440
coming their way

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,920
um the i had people in tears when i

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,480
started talking about open source at sun

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,240
uh claiming that i was changing the

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,760
companies that were not

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,480
going to be useful and even today

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,680
sometimes people accuse me of helping to

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,600
kill sun

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,199
and i will tell you that that hustling

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,639
gave a keynote um

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,399
at north american apache con last year

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,040
and he said two really important things

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,880
to me one was i was front row so he

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,160
really was just talking to me

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,240
one was that in fact sun was its most

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,720
efficient from a software

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,320
value capture perspective after they'd

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
open sourced everything

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,519
because they stopped fooling around with

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
 licenses

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,279
and started just writing straightforward

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,360
sport contracts which made a lot more

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,279
sense and turned out to be profitable

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,720
the other thing was if we had not open

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680
sourced everything that wasn't nailed

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
down at sun

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,839
it would all be lost now because at

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
least that was james's feeling he said

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,320
we wouldn't have java now if we hadn't

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,720
done it

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,480
and he thanked me because he fought me

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
while while it was going down he didn't

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,199
really want it to happen but now he sees

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
it was a good thing

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,320
so be aware that these people are going

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,959
to be pushing back from a real place of

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,839
of concern and you have to honor their

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,519
concern

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,519
but you also have to find a way around

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,000
them

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,760
and i will admit a personal bias when i

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,480
see a picture like this

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,880
i don't think about the miles that lava

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,519
flow

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,760
traveled through farmland and housing

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,880
and forest i just see new earth being

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,839
built

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,760
i love that this process is so

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,440
generative but if i was a farmer

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,279
or i owned a house that was in the path

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,399
of that lava i'd be very focused on that

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,639
destruction

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,240
and so you know it's two two sides of

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,240
the same coin and you just have to honor

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,360
them

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,759
one way to mitigate um concern is

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,199
to treat everything very scientifically

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,880
as an experiment

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,839
and i'm really serious about this

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,839
methodology you want to choose a small

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
experiment that is likely to be

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,880
controllable as in not going to get out

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,279
of hand

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,399
but you make a hypothesis you want to

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,560
write it

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,880
you want to set up an experiment that

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,519
proves your hypothesis

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,800
and you want to measure the things that

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,800
feed into that proof

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,920
you don't want to exhaustively measure

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,480
every aspect

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,360
of what happens although you do want to

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,759
note

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,000
the unintended consequences that happen

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,560
because they're part of the story

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,839
and then after a certain amount of time

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,800
you want to

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,839
revisit original hypothesis and evaluate

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,639
what you learned

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
in this experiment and then pivot and do

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,839
another one

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
this step approach has a way of

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,120
containing your risk

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,959
although eventually you're going gonna

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,360
have to dive off the cliff but you can

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,880
learn a lot by working in this way

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,920
and you can do a lot to prove to your

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,560
company that you're doing the right

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,800
thing

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
and what you want to prove to them is

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,199
the value that you're creating

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,440
by doing this new thing are you saving

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,360
them time or can you see how saving them

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,199
time is going to be part of the practice

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,279
are you saving them money or are you

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,600
creating you know new value

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,800
did you innovate in a way that's going

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,639
to get

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
more money that they wouldn't otherwise

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,079
have gotten

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,240
did you know the quality in a way that

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,399
makes the

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,040
consumerians better right all of these

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,199
things

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240
are value that can be created in one of

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,639
those experiments

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,959
and you want to package that up and

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,079
evangelize it to both your air cover and

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
your ground cover

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,360
and to the middle managers if they'll

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,559
listen to you but really it's your air

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,760
cover and your ground cover that you're

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,799
trying to sell these ideas to

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,559
one more thing that often you find when

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,000
you start doing change which is that

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,360
your newest employee

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,600
your intern employees love suddenly

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,559
having this agency happening

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,640
it gives them hope the changes are

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,520
coming in the company to make them more

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,039
comfortable

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
because they're typically not super

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,559
comfortable with the way that

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,440
corporations work and why would they be

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,799
i mean it it's over many years and it's

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
usually pretty weird

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,799
right so if they decide to leave because

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,080
they see no

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,320
hope of change then you've wasted the

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
the time that you spent recruiting them

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,360
and training them

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,760
so it's better not to have that happen

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,360
this becomes a real value that you can

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,080
quantify and then of course there is the

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,960
famous

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,000
outside in marketing which i used a lot

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,720
at sun

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,480
this is where you take the ultimate risk

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,160
of saying something publicly that your

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,520
company didn't approve

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,840
because you want them the the popularity

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,559
of that message reflected back

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,799
by the public it's a really risky move

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,039
but it can be really really powerful

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,840
and and as i say i'm a big advocate of

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,240
it but

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,000
um i also knew ahead of time that i

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,919
could survive if i got fired so

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
i suggest again you do that assessment

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,799
first right

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,000
and then last and maybe most importantly

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,160
you're not going to get the same

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,520
validation that regular

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,280
employees get um it's just the nature of

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,080
change agency that they like to shoot

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,559
the messenger

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,520
and you're going to find yourself not

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,559
doing as well

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,440
in your reviews i often tell people to

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,880
um get the best deal they can going into

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,039
a company because it's really

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,559
right it's a long road at that next

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,320
piece of recognition

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,840
remember i said that somebody tried to

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,919
fire me every every

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
quarter for five and a half years well

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,440
in that last six months i started to

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,400
notice that the people that used to try

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
to fire me

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,240
were suddenly claiming credit for all of

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,960
the risks that i had

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,240
had done and taken and it really hurt my

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,000
feelings for the first

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,080
you know month that i noticed it and

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,600
then i realized that what it meant was

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,480
that i was winning

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,919
if i had not had the internal compass

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,880
the internal navigation

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,360
my north star to say i know that this is

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,440
a good change that i'm enacting here

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,720
um it would have been a long five and a

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,200
half years

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
and so you have to have that animus

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,840
inside you and know that you're doing

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,240
the right thing

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,760
and it's to have friends it's helpful to

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,799
have an association like

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,320
um our friends at to do but at the end

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,200
of the day it's on you

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,960
to keep yourself happy and to know that

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,919
you're heading in the right direction

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,440
and believe me it will come as i was

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,440
leaving some they offered me

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,799
a vice presidency and what was would

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,480
have gone you know

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,720
director to vice president skipping a

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,640
lot of steps now i decided not to take

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,840
that path and went on another path

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,400
but it will come if you

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,360
keep working and keep reporting that

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
value back

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,159
and and work forward as much as you can

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,559
and it's a totally rewarding journey so

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,039
i hope you will undertake it

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,080
now i think we have time for just a few

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,880
questions

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,159
so i am going to go ahead and let the

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,360
conference put me on

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,679
um live screen and um let me just give

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
you

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,679
a one last screen here this is my

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,840
information

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,760
and also if you were interested in that

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,679
inner source thing if you go to that url

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,400
you'll find a lot more about it as well

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:49,840
as well

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,840
so let's go to the questions

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,000
right don't see myself yet

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,360
there i am hi there those of you that

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,240
are here

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,120
uh i am very happy to continue to answer

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,039
questions

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,520
the ones that i've gotten so far i got

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:12,000
some love for the event for the talk

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,600
so thank you for that and also got some

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,280
queries about whether the slides will be

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,760
made available and they will

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,520
if they're helpful to you in particular

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
um does anybody have a question that

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
they

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,360
you know burning question they'd like me

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,080
to answer here that isn't already in the

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,240
queue

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,840
if they type it in fast i will have we

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,280
have i think about

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,280
five minutes so feel free to type

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,679
let's see what else can i share with you

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,320
while that's happening

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,440
um oh i didn't say anything about the

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,640
difference between

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,840
whether change agents are are

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,559
born or made um i actually think they're

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,600
born

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,600
i i have coached a few people

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,080
into becoming change agents but it

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,760
wasn't a pleasant experience for them

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,480
like it is for me so um and i was that

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,200
kid that you know was rearranging the

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,600
the playground when i was a little kid

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,480
like i've always been a change agent so

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,919
um i think it helps if you come to terms

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,960
with the fact that you're just wired

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,320
that way

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,320
and um and that that's your best role

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,240
okay here nick would like to know if

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,320
there's any advice for starting over due

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,280
to company restructuring or fluctuations

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,679
in leadership

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,600
you mean when your air cover disappears

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,760
that actually happened to me at paypal

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,600
the people that hired me almost all of

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,480
them left the company

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,280
before i did and i had the cto that

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,280
hired me

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,880
take me aside on his last day and say

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,720
you should quit

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,720
but i had already lined up the

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,840
conditions that were going to make the

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,720
launch of inner source

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,960
possible and i didn't feel like i could

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,799
take steps back and then start again

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,640
at that moment it was the momentum it

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,600
was already going so i decided to stick

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,320
it out

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,960
it was not a pleasant last two and a

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
half years

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,320
in fact i was talking to dwayne about

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,520
this last night and he said i don't know

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,960
how you did it boss

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,600
um it wasn't pleasant but i had a goal

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,039
in mind

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,600
and i stuck with it so take here i think

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,200
that the

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,720
powerpoint slides are going to be made

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,799
available in my speaker area

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
i have to send them to the linux

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,120
foundation still i i didn't do that

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,960
because i had sent a pre-recorded thing

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,919
so just a sec let me see i think i saw

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,559
another nick question is that true

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,559
um oh

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,080
this is a little bit tricky this this

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,440
tool so i'm trying to find the other

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,799
questions

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,360
um okay let's see how do you oh nithia

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,919
how do you balance community and

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,640
company interests it's an interesting

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,760
question

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,320
um the best community managers

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,600
are always accused of going native by

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,120
somebody at some point

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,080
in their career because walking the line

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,679
between

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,360
what the community wants and what the

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,720
company wants is always

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,559
is always tricky right what i

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,240
try to do is suss out what the right

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,480
path is and find allies who agree with

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,640
me about that path

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,559
and i think i've i've spoken before

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,919
about the outside in marketing

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,919
my the way that i did that at sun was i

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,919
would faithfully reproduce whatever the

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,919
messaging was that the message

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,360
people had given me and they changed all

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,799
the time so it was a lot of work to

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,039
remember them

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,120
i would faithfully say that message and

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,279
then on stage i would physically take a

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,520
step to the right or left and i would

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,120
say but this is what i think

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,720
and i'd make it clear that i wasn't

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
speaking on behalf of the company that i

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,919
was expressing

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,840
personal opinion and then i would

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,039
usually step back to the center and

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,799
restate

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,480
you know another time what it what you

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,400
know why i thought the company

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,559
was in good faith and whatever it was

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
that they wanted me to say

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,039
but what i was doing was making an

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,120
opportunity for the community to say

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,080
well what you said is closer to what we

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,320
believe

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,720
and that could then be reflected back to

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,600
the company by them not by me

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,320
um there were people inside of sun

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,640
especially

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,400
the people that made those messages up

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,679
uh who felt like i wasn't

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,640
behaving and at one point um

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,720
i and i think also simon phipps were um

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,600
not allowed to speak for a while we were

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
we were

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,000
uh kept from speaking but there was a

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,240
speaker handler um

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,360
named jim grizzanzio who is now a

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,360
community manager

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,400
um which is it was a great transition

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,120
for him

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,120
um who saw that the outside world wanted

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,120
to hear what we had to say like they

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,799
that we were the breath of fresh air in

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,240
the messaging at that point so he put

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,120
his job on the line

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,400
and continued to give us space so

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,960
sometimes

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,400
change agency really feels like a game

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,480
of strategy

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,840
you know like a very sophisticated chess

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,600
game

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,840
and the best you can do is make sure

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,559
that no individual pieces

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,400
get sacrificed without their complicity

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,799
if you know what i'm saying

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,760
including yourself right it's best if

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,720
you put yourself on

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,400
online first and then always be warm and

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,039
generous about your company

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,120
it doesn't play well to um air

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,799
grievances with your company in front of

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
the world and i don't think i ever did

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,840
that

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,080
i think i was i was um

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,960
more uh

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,520
i was i was being the change i wanted to

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
see but

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,200
hopefully in a way that didn't damage

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,840
sun's credibility and i don't think it

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,360
did

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,000
i think at the end of the day it never

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,360
did it is a balancing act it's one of

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
the hardest parts

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,679
and it's why it's a really good idea to

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,840
already know your internal compass

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,960
and where you're hoping to go and and

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,279
why

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,960
right because you're not always going to

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,480
make people happy

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,880
guy um

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,799
yeah helping the guy wants to know how

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,679
to help middle managers not be the kind

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,159
of middle manager that you work around

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,000
i have had some limited success at

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,400
making friends with middle managers

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,840
and getting them to believe that i'm not

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,400
undermining them

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,360
by letting them in on where i think the

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,600
future is

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,760
headed and helping them figure out their

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,159
moves if you if you will

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,440
um and that's that's certainly a real

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,600
possibility

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,520
um i've also coached a few managers

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,360
of my own you know i of course i also

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,640
had middle managers trying to corral me

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,159
at various times

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,480
and i've i've shown them with some

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,600
clarity that maybe they're misguided

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,799
uh in their assessment that's the nicest

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
way i can put it

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,240
you have to appreciate that middle

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,880
managers are are trying to do the job

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,360
that they think

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,600
that they were given um it's super

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,559
helpful if your air cover can help you

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,520
tweak their understanding of their jobs

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,200
a little bit

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,520
and you have to assess the culture

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,320
because if the company has been

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,960
profligate in its new initiatives you'll

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
find that

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
it's harder to gain the trust of the

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,200
middle managers because they've been

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,279
through so much

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,679
uh failed change that they're just not

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,760
interested in taking a risk again

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,679
so you have to you know you have to play

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,360
that by ear that's that's worth looking

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,159
at when you're thinking about joining a

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,159
company

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,080
what's the state of the middle managers

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
and how likely are they to

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,159
at least some percentage of them to

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,399
become your your allies

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,159
um so and i've been a middle manager as

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,480
well it's not an easy position

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,320
as as most of you that have done it know

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,840
it's it's a tough balancing act as well

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,720
so you got to have some compassion for

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,279
that

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,760
um likewise these days i didn't call it

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,600
out but

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,799
product owners are having a really hard

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,440
time right now as

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,279
agile kind of displaces some of the

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,159
functions of the product owner

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,840
and yet they're not given good tools to

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,039
do their new job

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,320
uh very well and um so they're you know

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,240
they're playing it from the hip

00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,679
a lot of them and they need a lot of

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,520
help um

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,640
to not use the wrong tools to get what

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,399
they need

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,919
you know this is the whole problem with

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,760
executive escalation

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,600
if you get your friend the executive

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,520
your air cover to call

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,039
somebody else's air cover and force them

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,360
to do something

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,559
you're also breaking the system so

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,279
you've got to be a little careful how

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,279
you use that

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,960
so anyway

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,799
how are we doing on time i'm guessing

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,159
that we're almost at the time where i

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,120
have to say that

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
uh you can meet me over in the community

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,799
area

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,720
number two on the slack and um

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,840
let me check with grace and see grace is

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,840
that right

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,120
okay great yeah see i've got a i've got

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,120
a clock running here which tells me

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,960
roughly where we're at so i don't want

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,679
to take up time that belongs to the next

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
speaker so

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,640
i'm going to go ahead and go over to the

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,000
slack channel and i hope that you guys

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,880
will follow me if you want to have more

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,840
conversation

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:09,840
and thank you so much for showing up

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,440
