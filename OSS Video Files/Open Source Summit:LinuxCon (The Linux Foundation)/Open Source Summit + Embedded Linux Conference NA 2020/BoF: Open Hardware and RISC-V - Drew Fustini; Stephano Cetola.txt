hello everyone so this is I just saw the

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,470
Yocto they just did a birdÃ­s of a

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,179
feather I think it worked out pretty

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,750
well for them so hopefully we'll have

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,230
success as well with the Virtual Boff

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,910
so me and Stefano wanted to have a place

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,090
where people talk about risk five here

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,130
at the middle Ennis conference so just

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,590
wanted to stop start off with mentioning

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,990
the other risk five related content is

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,090
happening here at LC so tomorrow I'm

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,830
gonna give a talk about Linux on open

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,160
source hardware which we were in a touch

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,440
on here then cursed asana who is

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,840
the professor at UC Berkeley that was

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,610
behind creating this project he's gonna

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,129
give a keynote on Wednesday so you'll

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,780
get a good overview them and Kim's gonna

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,579
talk about the state of software

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,730
development tools on Wednesday and then

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,100
Kalista redmond who's the head of risk 5

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,920
international which is the nonprofit

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,730
that governs risk 5 is gonna have a

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,260
expert session on Thursday we also have

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,019
lots of meetups going on which right now

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,210
are virtual but Munich in Bay Area we're

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,970
both last week I believe so you can go

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,990
to risk five org local and check out

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,630
what meetups are going on there so risk

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,140
5 is a new instruction set architecture

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,200
that was created about 10 years ago by a

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,670
team at UC Berkeley they were doing

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,770
computer architecture research and they

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,710
wanted instructions that they could use

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,939
to do that they didn't want to deal with

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,409
licensing commercial ISAs it's risk 5

00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:37,140
because it's the fifth risk instruction

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,020
set to come out of Berkeley to great

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,939
talks one is instruction sets want to be

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,040
free and this is from David Patterson

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,470
who is the co-creator of the original

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,659
risk back in the early 80s and then

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,170
you'll see this on Wednesday on the the

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,030
kind of state of the union risk 5 cursed

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,259
asana which gives this a couple times a

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,270
year so you can always check out the

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,509
latest one on youtube kind of gives it

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,350
over pull over you what risk 5 is and in

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,520
the ecosystem real quick just kind of to

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,629
go over for people that aren't familiar

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:13,770
with is a this is a talk from a new

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:16,920
patel at the linux LCA back in 2020

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,960
the last conferences that happened so

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,560
the idea behind race five is that it's a

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,880
new is a clean slate inextensible so

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,850
everything that was learned over the

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,650
years from doing computer architecture

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,410
to research at Berkeley they put that

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,540
into making this is a an idea here as he

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,640
goes from 32-bit small microcontrollers

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,800
all the way up to supercomputers here so

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,100
it's one instruction set that can span

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,480
all those different use cases and also

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,430
the idea here of different privilege

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,040
levels so we have machine mode or M

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,320
which is where the firmware runs the

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,390
bootloader and then operating system

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,330
runs the supervisor mode and then above

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,570
that there's user space there's also an

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,490
extension for hypervisor that's being

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,290
worked on right now so I mention its

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,390
extensible and the one of the ways is

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,810
that works is it's not just one is a

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,210
it's a setup is a z' and the key thing

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,990
here is that the base one is a 32-bit

00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:16,260
integer is a and that's frozen that'll

00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,120
never change so if you were to compile

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,960
for that but right now it would still

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,580
work in you know 20 years on some fancy

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,410
128-bit risk 5 computer so the idea here

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,080
is there's extensions that then get

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,970
ratified and frozen and you'll kind of

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,490
see like these it's kind of a soup of

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,990
letters and numbers so each of these

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,660
different extensions has a different

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,380
letter for purposes of Linux we

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,860
generally talking about our V 64 GC

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:47,430
which means they can do integer multiply

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:49,680
Atomics and float I think that's it but

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:54,450
so you'll find out more that if you

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:58,250
check out the keynote on Wednesday and

00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:01,200
this was from Tisha's slide from LCA

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,780
2020 and to kind of give you an overview

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,090
here of what is the ecosystem for

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:11,700
software on risk 5 so we have support

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,700
now in a lot of things and we're gonna

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,400
go through that real quick here there's

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,560
anyone raise their hand or said anything

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,760
yet stuff I know so far no questions

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,010
come down so this is an alert slide from

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,070
and teaches presentation hopefully a few

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,630
the peep

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,620
the people will be able to jump in here

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:35,350
and speak up so the idea here is we have

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:40,330
our normal SOC ROM and then that goes

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:42,840
into M mode which could be you boot and

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,820
then we have open SPI which is this

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,650
supervisory interface and then go into

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,160
you boot and then finally get up into

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,420
Linux so kind of a normal boot flow but

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,710
one of the terms you might not be

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,270
familiar with especially if you're

00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:01,330
coming from arm is SBI so SBI is the

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,250
supervisor binary interface so there's

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,320
this privilege spec so one of the

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,390
extensions for risk live is a privilege

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,860
spec and that defines basically you're

00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,890
going to have an operating system like

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,160
we're familiar with like Linux an SPI is

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:18,160
the kind of way you go between the

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,140
machine mode and the supervisor mode s

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,090
mode so it kind of sits there between

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:26,740
the the OS and the hardware and this

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,140
came out of the UNIX platform

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,090
specification working group so you can

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,100
as an individual during the risk v

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:37,330
international organization and then you

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,460
can join these email listens that talk

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,620
about the UNIX platform specification so

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,890
this is kind of come out of work that

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,920
they're doing and in particular so SBI

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:51,100
is a specification and then there's open

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,470
s VI which is implementation which is

00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,180
you'll see is very common in in most of

00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:00,430
the different platforms so we're going

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:03,430
to talk about and one of the things that

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:07,270
just happened was UEFI support there's a

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:11,200
patch series now on the Linux was 5

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:14,230
mailing list so it's coming along to

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,600
have that kind of generic ufi support in

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:22,420
you boot and an openness beyond and then

00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:25,120
in the Linux kernel as well so Linux

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:29,560
distributions and I hope he's gonna be

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,260
on here David works on the Fedora report

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,790
and has a lot of knowledge so if he is

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,730
on here hopefully can give us some

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,730
insights but basically both fedora and

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,900
Debian have ports sousei is working on

00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,210
it as well now

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,240
and then yak dough and openembedded

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,550
support it and I think Kim all probably

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,010
talks more about that on Wednesday in

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,949
his talk and there's also support and

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,810
build route as well so we're a little

00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,520
short on the hardware side right now but

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:02,979
the software support is really coming

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,750
together and because risk five is a

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:06,340
relatively new thing we don't have a lot

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,580
of hardware out there that we can run

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,060
especially operating systems on so Q is

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,669
a great way that developments been done

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,700
with the Linux kernel support in getting

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:21,760
the distros running so if you don't have

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:26,919
any hardware you can on your PC try this

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:29,590
stuff out with qemu so I think it was

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:33,340
maybe three EOC years ago 2017 maybe

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,600
that um sci-fi was on the sponsors we

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,550
were in Portland and they had a bunch of

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,610
these boards there so this is a really

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,820
exciting Lord has for 64-bit RISC five

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,820
cores this board was pretty expensive it

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:49,120
was $1000 it was available in limited

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,090
quantities because sy5 is not a company

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,940
that's making chips they design cores

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,680
that then other companies might not use

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,120
so this is probably the best board

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,849
that's out there though it's pretty hard

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,440
to get inexpensive but when you have

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:05,020
this with the whole set up here with

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,240
some additional FPGA expansion cards you

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,479
can actually have a full Linux desktop

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,860
running here and if David is able to

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,380
join he can maybe talk to her about it

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,880
he has one of these setups where he's

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:22,300
working on the fedora port though so the

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,669
the lower end version is this board here

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,479
which has a processor called the Kendra

00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:31,180
K 210 and this is something that's Kevin

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,300
been in the works for a while back in

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,760
last year at Linux plumbers Daniel Amal

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,620
from Western Digital talked about

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,070
experiments they were doing to get Linux

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:44,380
running on this so this is a dual-core

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,360
64-bit RISC 5 processor at foreigner

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,160
megahertz which is actually pretty nice

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,070
the downside here is only has 8

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,550
megabytes of memory which is pretty

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:57,160
limiting it also does have an MMU they

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:00,880
and they implemented a spec which was

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:05,080
too old for to be supported in linux so

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,720
work was done to essentially allow it to

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,220
be supported with no mu and with m mode

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,370
which is machine mode instead of

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,010
supervisor mode unlike risk five and

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,620
with Linux five eight kernel the full

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,180
support is going to be there so pretty

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,640
much all you can do only thing you can

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,730
do right now with it is you can game ian

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,980
has build group with busybox you can run

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,680
on it but in order to do anything more

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,589
we need something called FD pick support

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,100
or an analogue in risk 5 this is what

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:38,410
arm does on those norm mu systems where

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,750
you can run Linux basically allows you

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,459
to use shared libraries so without like

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,829
shared libraries we run out of space

00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:47,290
very quickly so that work is still

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,670
ongoing though I asked on the list

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,180
recently doesn't look like there's

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:54,880
anything new right now the the other

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,310
cool thing is you boot there's a patch

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,930
series that adds support for that that

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,680
was just posted for for one of those

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:06,550
psyche boards with the Kendrick a 210

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,410
ship now one of the things I'm quite

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,029
excited about that was not quite here

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,220
yet so there's an organization called

00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:15,700
the open hardware group that's working

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,380
with different companies like an XP and

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,589
I think there's a couple other silicon

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,050
labs maybe so the really interesting

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,570
thing here is they basically took one of

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,670
the IMX processors like an imx6 or

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,790
something like that and they took out

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,190
the arm core and they're dropping in a

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,020
64-bit RISC five core but we have the

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,630
rest of the sort of peripherals that

00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:42,250
everyone's used to in likes on the IMX

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:44,350
series including the Vivante GPU so it

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,540
should be supported with open-source

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,579
driver so this is really exciting

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,529
however it's not going to tape out until

00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:54,820
the end of this year and it's just it's

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:58,690
just a test project so maybe in 2021

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,740
we'll see a product come out from an XP

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,459
or someone else that you could actually

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:06,100
buy and build the board around now I

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:08,230
have one glaring thing missing here

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,580
which since its life I'll just go to

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,410
so microchip has a similar to like a

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,970
zhiling sink they have an fpga with a

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,860
hard risk 5 core called the polar fire

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,780
SOC and that should have been in there

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,450
so this just launched or this just

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,180
showed up yet last week on crowd supply

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:31,690
which is a site that you can essentially

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,460
crowd fund new boards on so this is

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,730
pretty exciting this is a think

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,670
quad-core risk 5 processor but this

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,340
board's gonna be probably at least half

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,670
least half the price of the side 5 board

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,010
and this chip here the polar fire SOC

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:51,130
you'll be able to buy in distribution so

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,990
we'll probably see later this year next

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,660
year a series of different boards that

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,430
we're using this SOC so there is an FPGA

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:03,720
but the key thing to focus on here is it

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:06,960
has 4 Hearts II six silicon risk 5 cores

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,010
we did it have one question just about

00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,490
how we're coming along in terms of

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:14,350
consumer uptake so the polar fire is a

00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,360
good example of you know some of the

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,160
folks that are sir

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,070
currently starting to spin chips with

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,810
risk 5 but really just head over to our

00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:26,560
member site and look at the folks that

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:29,650
are joining specifically at the at the

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,820
premier level the premier level members

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,980
are really the ones you're going to look

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,630
to in terms of when I see a new board

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,900
coming out who is it going to be coming

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,370
from so that's a good indicator but also

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,610
in general I think we're seeing a lot

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:47,500
more and we hope to see a few sub $500

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:49,180
boards in the next year yeah in just a

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,010
quick reminder for everyone if you go to

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,790
risk 5 or you can find all that

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:59,380
information let me flip back to the

00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:01,960
slides here so one of the other options

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:07,020
that we have because it's been taking a

00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,710
while for companies to make hard soces

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:13,510
chips that we can we can use in boards

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,900
so one of the other options is used

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:19,420
FPGAs so Meghan walks from sy5 give an

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,860
interesting talk about this last year

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,720
last November

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,240
and I'll talk a little bit more about

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,480
this in my talk tomorrow but one of the

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,160
neat things has happened with FPGAs

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,019
recently is there's now open source tool

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,880
chains for them which is which is great

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:38,959
because they're fried cherry tools were

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,850
massive and in this is a really nice

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,800
thing that's happening in FPGA world and

00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:46,430
the cool thing we can do is we now have

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,920
a open-source tool chain that can run on

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,380
a part called the lattice ECP 5 which is

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,290
capable capable enough for us to be able

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,230
to run Linux on it so we can have Linux

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:00,649
running on a soft core inside the FPGA

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,940
using only free software tools one of

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,350
the board so you can get if you wanted

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,950
to play around with this is called the

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:10,010
UL x3s that's out of a hacker space in

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,630
Croatia on crowd supply and then another

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,579
really nice board that I'm quite excited

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:17,240
about is this little tiny board called

00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:19,519
the orange crab and this has the ECP 5

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,399
that you can put a soft core in and has

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,690
a hard 28 megabytes of DDR Ram so it's

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,170
enough for us to do some interesting

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:29,000
things with Linux on the board one thing

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,089
no no yeah another quick question just

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,640
about regarding risk 5 and things like

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,380
the BeagleBoard project so I think what

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,680
you're getting at is a much cheaper than

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,480
$500 board I can't speak to what Texas

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,190
Instruments may or may not be doing but

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,589
I can say that we're hoping to see some

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,470
sub $100 boards that are capable of

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:53,870
running Linux come out next year yes

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:58,100
yeah so my one of my hopes is to get get

00:14:53,870 --> 00:15:01,010
$100 for it off their sub $100 board and

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:05,360
for one runner out to do that is both of

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:08,750
these boards here with these FPGAs there

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,760
are about $100 though the one downside

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,850
to that is with the soft core it's only

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,850
gonna run maybe 50 megahertz 100

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:18,199
megahertz on a really nice FPGA so above

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,750
that you're really limited with the

00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:24,980
software's what we really need is SOC s

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:27,079
so the polar fire SOC for microchips can

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,589
be exciting because enough because it

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,209
has an FPGA in it I think it's going to

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:34,730
probably not be cheap enough necessarily

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,620
to get you know sort of a BeagleBone or

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,030
Raspberry Pi prize

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,530
I'm also hopeful that a company like

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,800
Kendra might come out with a more

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,660
capable SOC with external memory because

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,530
that Kendra chip would be really nice if

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,930
it has external memory interface so I

00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:53,780
think 2021 we will probably see some

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,030
nice options out there and then the open

00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,560
harbor groups test ship you know that

00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,630
goes according to plan I think we could

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,200
see an NXT product that would be

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,880
available in distribution but if you

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,790
don't any hardware at all and you don't

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,670
want to run QEMU another thing you try

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,400
out is we note this is from a micro it's

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,780
open source essentially emulator and it

00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,820
allows you to choose from a list of

00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,940
different boards and essentially run

00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,820
them emulated on your computer so this

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,680
is me running Reno to emulate the sci-fi

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,400
Unleashed board so that board that was

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:32,030
$1,000 you can emulate it on your

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,950
computer and because your computer is if

00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,370
as long as your repeaters a relatively

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,050
powerful it actually feels interactive

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,630
you know it's not like chugging along

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:45,250
really slow speed so it's a nice way to

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,250
do things if you don't have hardware

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,350
one of the last things I want to talk

00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:54,170
about here unless anyone else has spoken

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,050
up yet is kind of what's going on with

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,730
the Linux kernel with the RISC 5 support

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,190
so the best resource I would say is if

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:04,970
you hop on the the Linux kernel mailing

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,500
list for the RISC 5 architecture you can

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,390
go through the archives there on lore

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,080
but some of the things have been added

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:16,220
recently our EBP F which is exciting

00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:19,760
because everyone loves EBP F also a kg

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:23,000
DB K exec and K dump which help with

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,360
debugging video so support which helps

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,700
with optimizing being able to check the

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:33,200
time system time sis caller which is

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,970
basically a security fuzzer and then one

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,450
other things was being able to build

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,590
with clang instead of GCC and then

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,920
there's other things that are upcoming

00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:46,340
like the ufi support there's been some

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,980
work on the interrupt controllers this

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,520
one is a core level interrupt interrupt

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,230
support that's on the sci-fi board

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,290
there's also a hypervisor spec that's in

00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,970
the works for risk 5 and there is work

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:03,830
being done to have it integrated with

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:08,030
qme yeah with KVM there's also support

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:10,670
being worked on to basically improve the

00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,590
performance measurement pmu and in perso

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,240
we can start getting that performance

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,740
data that were used to on other

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:21,530
architectures and then also CPU

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:25,460
frequency driver support and the sigh

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:29,240
five board and a great thing to check

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:33,530
out was last week at the Munich risk

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,720
five meetup bjorn topo gave a really

00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,450
great talk about what's missing in the

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,390
risk v linux kernel and he goes through

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:44,330
here let me just show you real quick

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:47,030
here he goes through here and lists a

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,040
bunch of things that are marked as to do

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,640
I mean things that you could work on if

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,470
you were interested in jumping in and

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,530
helping out with stuff and as he says

00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,420
that'll keep you busy train this summer

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,550
so highly recommend checking out the

00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,370
slides from this talk and the video

00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:08,120
should be posted this week so in the

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:11,300
next day or two and I think that is the

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:16,180
end of the slides we had anyone else

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:19,940
jump on here just a quick question about

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:24,440
the Google Doc yeah so we'll share the

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:37,070
slides after the presentation actually I

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:39,680
got into the Ritz fine PPS oh yeah so

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,840
Allister there in the chat he is person

00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,540
from westerns usual that does the key

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:49,340
immune risk 5 support yeah I'm not sure

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:53,060
what that means by gpo's maybe emulating

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,400
them there is a GPIO mock-up driver that

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,290
I think would make little dork I'm not

00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,850
sure though there should be a way for

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,900
people to jump in here and talk if they

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,300
want to you know

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,590
I don't know who else is joining

00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,960
Alicia's in here

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:11,440
yeah so the teachers in here he's one of

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:15,100
the main Linux kernel developers but

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,400
he's at Western Digital Alistair is the

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,680
person working on qemu so we did what

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,140
people wouldn't tell did have a quick we

00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:27,130
had a question about is there a risk

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:29,470
five equivalent arms trust zone and the

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,360
answer is yes there is actually a

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:37,630
working group currently called the trust

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:39,880
of execution group te group and they're

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:49,900
working on I believe remember the

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:51,190
version of the spec so the short answer

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,530
that is yes there is a group that's

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,760
currently working on that I know that

00:20:53,530 --> 00:21:01,620
I've been trying to get a fpga-based

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:06,850
demo of trust execution environment

00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,830
capable core running with the group for

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:12,490
the IETF that does hackathons on a

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:18,970
protocol called teep so and I'll put

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:22,420
those links in here and I think my I did

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,790
a get pushed real quick to try and get

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,970
this up there which if it did off I'll

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:31,890
drop this link in the chat as well oh I

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,890
guess it is yeah anyways

00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:53,019
so is anyone want to ask a question with

00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:54,969
voice I think we can do that yeah if

00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,679
anyone wants to make a comment or a

00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:58,659
question they believe you can raise your

00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:01,090
hand and we can give you audio

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:20,139
capabilities or just post the question

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:23,609
up and we'll ask it here maybe yeah

00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:27,159
look cream mentioned there about the

00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:28,629
open-source implementations so yeah one

00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,969
of the things I guess maybe I should

00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:33,429
have clarified is so risk 5 itself is

00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:36,119
just an open source instruction set

00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:38,309
architecture is a and the

00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,830
implementations of that can be both

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:43,479
proprietary and open source so just

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,249
because you see res 5 doesn't mean that

00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:48,759
it's an open source design but there are

00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:52,479
a lot so some of the original ones for

00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:55,989
out of Berkeley are rocket and boom with

00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:59,139
two O's so those those are being used

00:22:55,989 --> 00:23:01,989
for the basis of commercial designs

00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:06,909
I think the side 5 stuff is based on

00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:08,830
rocket or boom I think and the open

00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:11,679
harbor group stuff the open HW group

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,019
stuff the core V um that when I showed

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,499
you that look kind of like a nxp imax

00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:19,210
that one is based on core out of ETH

00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:20,919
Zurich called pulp

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:25,710
it's from the pulp team there and that

00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:27,309
one's called Ariane so a lot of the

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,539
ssese that we're seeing be

00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:30,849
commercialized both in the

00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:33,369
microcontrollers and in the like the

00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:36,779
application processors are based on some

00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:39,070
of these open source implementations I

00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:42,519
know it for people that are into

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,710
hardware design the berkeley ones I

00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:49,570
think are based on is that Scala

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:51,429
language chisel which I made some people

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,090
may or may not like all the each a

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,010
Zurich stuff is system barrel

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,810
and that's what open harbor group is

00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:00,680
doing system very long because they

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,870
believe it'll be easier to get that's

00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,260
what she's built on and verified that

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,540
way

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,390
Oh what do we have here some other

00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,510
things should you happen that when you

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:24,400
click on raised hand can you um give

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:28,310
Alejandra access to the mic thank you

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,100
Stefano for the session so I have a

00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:33,440
question well I was aware of of the

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:36,530
changes in the Lunas kernel for support

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,280
to risk 5 but it's a surprise for me to

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:42,260
know about these No mmm you support for

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,290
its v evening news Colonel so I don't

00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,030
know if I got it right and this is maybe

00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,950
a desire or if something that is

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:53,800
happening and if that is the case I

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:57,320
think this is related to the

00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:00,110
communication project that was active

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,260
some years ago and I think is not active

00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:06,170
anymore or at least I'm not I don't have

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:10,220
any any news about it so what will you

00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:12,410
come' comment about it thank you yeah so

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,220
the the supports actually there now in

00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,470
five eight

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,590
so when five-eights released the first

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,060
part of the kendrick 8010 support was in

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,070
five seven

00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:26,090
so now after five eight it'll be fully

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:28,220
supported maybe if one of the other

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,780
someone from Western Digital wants to

00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,000
jump in but I believe the issue with the

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,510
Kendrick a to ten part is they do have

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,280
an MMU

00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,920
but the implemented aspect that was a

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,720
little bit older than what Linux support

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,730
so we basically have to treat it is not

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,730
having an MMU

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:45,980
so there's no I mean you and then

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,440
there's also machine mode versus s mode

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,230
so given that the Kendrick part doesn't

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,690
have much memory is just running Linux

00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,550
kernel in machine mode which means that

00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,260
we just have one address space we don't

00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,870
have virtual memory or anything that

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,540
sort of stuff and then the downside

00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:05,090
there is essentially you can only really

00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,549
want run like one busybox session and

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,259
then

00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:11,100
don't really have much RAM to do

00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:13,710
anything else which is why the idea of

00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,259
no amuse for coming up for userspace

00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,239
so the idea is that with arm there's a

00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:22,590
way called the FB pic of being able to

00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:24,779
have an assist the user space without

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,690
any mm you in the system they can share

00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:29,399
memory better so that's something that

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,039
that may happen there to make it more

00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:33,899
useful but for right now for you know

00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,419
it's $13 and you can actually have a

00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:40,200
real risk 5 system that's running Linux

00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:42,269
at 400 megahertz so it's a interesting

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,609
thing to play around with until we get

00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:49,169
better SOC s so we're actually running a

00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:52,559
lot of time here but we did have a quick

00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:54,330
question about Reno I'm not sure Dru if

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,970
you happen to know anything about Reno

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,710
two emulators and if they include things

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,419
like the host machines Nick

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,690
I haven't played around with renown

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,700
enough yeah it's quite sophisticated um

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,119
you can you should be able to do most

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,710
things with it the ant micro people put

00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,799
a lot of work into it and also the idea

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,989
be able to do Co development where

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,249
you're both some of the parts are

00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:19,980
actually in hardware and some of the

00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:21,960
parts are being emulated in software so

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,499
it's it's quite there's quite a lot

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,090
going on there

00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:30,059
so Android hello John and Kareem so I

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:32,720
don't believe Android is anywhere near

00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:36,210
being supported the main reason is I

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:40,200
don't think the Java supports very good

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:42,269
right now I could be corrected and can I

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,570
have more answers to that but I've not

00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:47,580
heard of anyone working on Android yet

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:49,859
and about the open implementations of

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,480
course swerved from Western Digital is

00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:54,210
is one of the big ones for the

00:27:51,480 --> 00:28:00,440
microcontroller class that's all open

00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:02,519
that's part of the what's the other

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,059
nonprofit and the other than the heart

00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:13,169
open Harbor Group they steward the

00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:15,330
swerve anyways The Lodger bone yeah I

00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:17,249
think that job is going to be a big

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,240
issue too that needs to get running well

00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:23,130
before we can have Android

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,790
The Lodger Bowen was a cape for the

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:28,920
BeagleBone someone just made kind of a

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,410
new version of that with the east b5

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,690
which is kind of interesting oh you were

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,190
thinking about chips Alliance tousle I&C

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,929
s so chips alliance if you check out

00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:40,620
chips Alliance they have swerve and

00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:42,090
several other cores so like the three

00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,179
main things you should look at is wrist

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:48,540
five international open harbor group and

00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:54,360
chips alliance a lot of the projects are

00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:56,370
falling under those umbrellas but I

00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,900
think we have to wrap it up I'm getting

00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,970
a message though we're near the end of

00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,429
our time we're already gone over I'll
