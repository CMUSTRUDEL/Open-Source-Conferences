welcome everyone

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,520
thank you so much for joining me to talk

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,040
about open source communities

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,800
i'm really excited to dive into

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,360
ambassador and contributor programs with

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
you today

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,160
so let me start off by introducing

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,600
myself my name is caitlin barnard and i

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,279
work in developer and community

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
marketing for open source

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,800
currently at kong for those of you who

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,840
might not be familiar with

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
kong we help manage all of your apis and

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
microservices

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,719
through our open source api gateway api

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,360
testing and service mesh solutions

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
so prior to that i was at cncf where i

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,640
worked heavily in the kubernetes

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,559
community and still do

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
i'm the co-chair for sig docs where i

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,120
lead the kubernetes blog

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,480
subproject i also work from home with my

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,399
favorite co-worker bruce

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920
i always like to throw in a dog picture

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
to help get everyone's attention

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,920
but i do hope you are a little bit more

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,840
excited to hear me talk about work than

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
he is

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,760
all right so today i'm going to be

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,760
talking to you

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,520
about the basics of building an

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,240
ambassador program and a

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
contributor pipeline from scratch um i

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
will say a lot of the themes that i'm

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,080
going to

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,759
touch on today will be relevant no

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,159
matter where you are in your community

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,799
building process

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,000
so when it comes to community building i

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,119
very much believe that there is no

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,880
one-size-fits-all solution

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,159
so today a lot of what i'm going to be

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,240
talking about is my

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,240
personal approach to community building

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,680
based on two examples of ambassador

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,439
programs that i've run

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
cloud native ambassadors and kong

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,200
champions so

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,680
cloud native ambassadors is cncf's

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,720
program it's currently at 106

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
ambassadors

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,920
the first time i did the talk it was

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,399
actually at 50 ambassadors

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,520
so i'm going to be referencing examples

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,320
from the earlier days of the program

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,920
i also find that oftentimes this example

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,079
can be a little bit intimidating for

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
people who are just getting started with

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,079
these programs because

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,079
cncf has experienced hyper growth over

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,759
the past few years

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,680
and they have a pipeline of contributors

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,160
from 19 projects now

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,480
so i'm also going to compare that to a

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,280
newer program that i'm working on now

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,200
which is kong champions so we started

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
this in may 2019

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,840
and are currently at nine champions

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,840
across five countries

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,280
all right so let's say you're thinking

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
about starting an ambassador program

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,920
when does it make sense i often times

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,920
see leadership teams saying that they

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
want to have an ambassador program but

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,360
they haven't really fully thought

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,440
through the goals and how this fits into

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
their overall community strategy

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,040
and that's a really difficult position

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,680
to be put in as a community manager

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,120
to have to manage those expectations

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,480
especially when it might not be the

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
right fit for your business

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
or your community at this time so

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,160
there's two

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,159
indicators that i like to look at before

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
i try to start one

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,440
the first is a clear path to

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
contribution so

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,159
your contributor pipeline has to be

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
really healthy before that can feed into

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,840
your ambassador pipeline because

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,120
most of the time this is the kit these

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
are the candidates you're going to be

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,599
pulling from

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
so you really can't have active

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,280
ambassadors until you have active

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,720
contributors or users

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
and then the second is do you have

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,200
internal buy-in to support the program

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,640
ambassadors require a huge amount of

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,720
support and resources from you

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,000
internally to make them effective

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,080
and is your organization willing to

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
support that do they understand the

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,959
value of the program

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,640
and then at the end of the day do they

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,159
care about supporting the community in

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
that way

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,360
so i'm going to dive into both these

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,519
indicators further

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,200
but i do want to first start talking

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
about goal setting for the programs

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,560
because this is going to affect

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
internal buy-in as well

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,120
all right so setting goals for the

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,760
program is the number one thing i like

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
to do

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,879
because it one ensures that it fits into

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,280
our strategy

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,959
and then two it helps get buy-in because

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,879
that is what our entire team is then

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
agreeing to work towards

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,879
so these can definitely differ between

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,640
communities but for me it's almost

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,480
always these four

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
one we want our ambassadors out in the

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
community creating awareness for what

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
the technology

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,919
is two we want them educating the local

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
and global community on how to use the

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,440
technology

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,040
three we want them helping to expand

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,479
that contributor pipeline that we talked

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
about by sharing their journey and

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,400
helping others get started

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,759
and four we also want them to grow

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
personally and professionally

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
by being part of our community because

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,880
at its core

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,000
this program really should be rewarding

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,160
to them

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,759
okay so now that we talked about

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,639
high-level goals for an ambassador

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,400
program

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,240
i want to take a step back and dive into

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,680
that first indicator that i mentioned

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,759
which was your contributor pipeline so

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,199
contributor pipeline is a huge factor in

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,479
the health of your open source community

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,000
to begin with

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,160
but it's also really difficult to build

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
an ambassador program until this is done

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,919
really well

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,880
so let's dive into how to build an

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,479
effective contributor pipeline

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
the key tenant and a lot of the things

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,919
that i'm going to mention here is really

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,400
having a clear and accessible

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,080
contributor documentation so this starts

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,919
with your contributor guide

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,680
this should really outline the ways for

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,440
contributors to get involved and then

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
what the entire contributor process

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
looks like from start to finish

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,840
the contributors guide should also

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,600
include a clear review process

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,919
because the worst experience for a

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,520
contributor is they do all the hard work

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,759
of contributing something

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,919
and then their issuer pr gets stuck in

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,080
limbo for months with no answer

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,120
so the review process should be clearly

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,360
documented

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,360
straightforward they should understand

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,639
when to get a response to their

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,680
um contribution and then know who to ask

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,440
for if they don't

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,880
um there should also be a place for

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,319
contributors to get help and ask

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,240
questions if they need it so this is

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
something like a slack channel

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,319
or weekly office hours where they have

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,919
that open line of communication to other

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
contributors and maintainers of the

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,680
project as well

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,120
and then finally it's really important

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
to make sure this is all in a central

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,960
location in my opinion

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,120
something like github confluence

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,919
whatever your central community hub

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,919
is there should be that one-stop shop

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,360
where any new or existing contributor

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,360
can go to get that information

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
so once we have our documentation let's

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,199
talk a little bit about how to get new

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,880
contributors into the project

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
and there's two pieces i want to talk

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,560
about here

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,600
so the first is overall project

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
awareness

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,919
and this is where someone typically like

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,000
myself in developer marketing comes in

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,240
or individuals in devrel can help with

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,479
this and it's how to market your project

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,160
to get more awareness

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
the project is most likely solving a

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
problem in some way so

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,280
we tend to share that information

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,720
through things like thought leadership

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,039
tutorials partner webinars meetups

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,880
conferences and speaking stuff like that

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,759
basically anything you would do to get a

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
user

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
is a great way to get contributors as

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,880
well

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
and then partnering with relevant open

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,080
source communities so is your project

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
written in go for example

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,400
you can target go developers what

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,360
whatever relevant technologies you're

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,840
leveraging

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
embrace those communities um and just to

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
be clear this isn't meant to sound like

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,960
poaching

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,880
uh contributors from another project but

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
more so expanding opportunities for them

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,759
to get involved with

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,000
other relevant technologies in the

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,599
ecosystem and they should also be

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
tech communities that you're

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,560
contributing back to so for example

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,400
our engineering team at kong contributes

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,879
back to the projects that kong is built

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,800
on top of like lua and openresty

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,120
but we do also get a lot of contributors

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
for those from those communities as well

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,639
because it's a shared technology that

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,919
it's built on

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
and then the final piece here is

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,840
recognition but i want to get to that on

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
the next slide

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,560
all right so how to incentivize

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,280
contributions and recognize your

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,599
contributors

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,720
um these people are really contributing

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,639
their time for free

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,759
so how can you thank them and make them

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
feel seen

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,199
and then similar to what i said with

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,479
ambassadors before give them the

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,759
opportunity to grow

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,039
personally and professionally so at kong

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
we have the

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,479
concept of code contributors and

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,759
non-code contributors you might be

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
familiar with this if you've worked in

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,680
the kubernetes community before we also

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,599
talk about it this way

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
so code contributors quite literally

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,320
contribute code to your project repo

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
and then non-code contributors create

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,760
content like

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,839
videos blog posts this can manifest in

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,440
ways beyond content

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,640
but for today i'm specifically going to

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,480
be referencing content

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,160
both are equally valuable to our

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,040
community but they do contribute in

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,440
different ways

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,600
so we like to balance the recognition

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,200
depending on the contribution type

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,880
and then what is important to that type

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
of contributor so

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,240
a few things here stay the same but i'm

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,480
going to talk about what we do for each

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
so for code contributions we do things

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
like contributor shirts

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
um if your pr is accepted to the kong

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,120
repo

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,920
you will receive a custom contributor

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,839
shirt we do different designs each year

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,800
contributor perks so these are things

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,560
like discounted access to kong summit

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,920
we do special events at the summit

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,640
itself for

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,200
contributors these this is our yearly

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,040
community and user conference

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,560
we also do first look at new features

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,920
that are coming on our roadmap

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,920
basically anything that can have

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,320
exclusive access we like to give that to

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,200
our contributors first

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,000
contributor spotlight so um this

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,839
highlights

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,080
contributors in our newsletters and blog

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
posts we'll eventually expand this to

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
fuller interview styles like a blog

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
post or video series on our ambassadors

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,519
and contributors

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,360
we did a similar series at cncf called

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,080
meet the ambassadors it's a video series

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,080
you can check out

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
hacktoberfest so um this has actually

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
been a great way for us to get new

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,320
contributors to the project and

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,240
awareness but we also do a fun piece of

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
swag exclusive for the event each year

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,240
as well

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,839
and then finally a clear path to take on

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,200
a larger role so

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,959
what does it look like to go from a

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240
contributor to a maintainer

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,240
what does it look like to go from a

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,920
contributor to a champion

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
this really goes back to that personal

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,440
and professional development piece

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,600
on how you can give people a clear

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,160
roadmap to taking on more responsibility

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,240
so then for non-code contributions um in

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,800
my opinion these are just as valuable as

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
code

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,360
because people are bringing in new users

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,000
and awareness to your project

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,079
so for them we do things like um we have

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,839
custom swag actually for non-code

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,160
contributions

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,600
um so we do like a custom gorilla for

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,440
non-code contributions

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,920
a t-shirt for code contributions and you

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,240
can kind of collect them all

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,680
contributor perks are typically the same

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,399
but contributor spotlight is a little

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,440
bit different

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,279
so we amplify the content that they're

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
creating on our channels retweeting

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,440
cross posting guest blogging

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,279
really however we can help get more eyes

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,880
on their content

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,640
and then finally the clear path to take

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
on a larger role

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,160
so this might look a little bit

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,279
different depending on how your project

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,440
is set up

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,600
um but this could be contributed that

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,320
contributor to champion pathway

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,640
or a special role like for example in

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,480
kubernetes the blog subproject lead is a

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
dedicated non-code contributor role

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,519
okay so now that we've got our goals

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,880
we've got our contributor pipeline how

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,680
do we start building our ambassador

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
program

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,200
and there's four initial things that i

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
like to do here

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
the first is reaching out to those

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,639
people in your contributor pipeline so

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,279
not only are they your potential

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,880
ambassadors but you can find out what

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,360
they would want out of an ambassador

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
program

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,240
and build around that so for cncf we

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,720
started with people already doing these

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,160
things

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,320
on their own and established in the

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
community for example hosting kubernetes

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,279
meetups

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
and then built the program around that

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,920
for kong

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,079
we started with our most active

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,120
contributors and users of the project

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,800
and then built around them the second

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
thing is do your research so

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,320
what are the communities exist in the

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
space what's working for them

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,079
what isn't how can you differentiate

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
because a lot of people are part of

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,959
multiple communities

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,519
and you don't want to have an exact

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,320
replica of the same program somebody is

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,079
already in

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,519
but you also don't necessarily need to

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,760
reinvent the wheel

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,360
um for your program either

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
third is establishing the value of being

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,560
part of the community so

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,240
what value are you providing that those

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,920
other programs don't

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
this isn't the ambassador's full-time

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,800
job so it's really important to clearly

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,560
communicate

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,560
what exactly it is that they're getting

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,480
out of it

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,760
and then fourth figure out how you're

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
going to promote your program and get

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,959
new ambassadors into it

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,880
so we already talked about contributor

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,160
pipeline but i also want to expand on

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,000
that a little bit more

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,440
and that's to say to reach out to people

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,240
directly um

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
it's a really great way to reach out to

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,519
people who are beyond just your github

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,279
contributors that you know

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,680
so for example we reach out to those

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,440
users who have written blog posts on us

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,760
or people who we meet at conferences who

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,519
we think might be a good fit

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,680
people really like to feel special and

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,079
invited so it doesn't hurt to ask them

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,639
because

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,160
worst case scenario they say no and at

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,320
the end of the day it might provide some

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,079
really useful feedback on how you can

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,320
make your program more compelling as

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,320
well

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,079
awesome so when first starting out these

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
are the key pieces that i like to put in

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,760
place

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,839
at the veer at the very beginning so the

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,519
first is a program overview

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,040
and this is similar to the contributor

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
guide in the sense that it should

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,360
outline what it means to be an

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
ambassador

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
what do they get out of it and how this

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,120
benefits the greater community

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,720
and then located in that central

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,800
community hub that we talked about as

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,079
well

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
the second is requirements and

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,880
expectations as i've mentioned a few

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,199
times now

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,199
this isn't their full-time job but you

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,360
should still set clear expectations

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,399
prior to someone joining the program

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
whether that's

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,480
you're expecting one blog post per

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,079
quarter hosting two meetups per year

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
basically how much time should they

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,880
expect to be contributing to this role

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,639
and then what happens if they don't or

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,839
are unable to meet those requirements at

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,839
any point

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,920
third is a code of conduct so these

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,639
people are acting on behalf of your

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
organization

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,720
and your project and working in a

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,519
diverse community of individuals

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,040
so a code of conduct really helps set

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,959
forth the values that you want your

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,000
community community representatives to

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,519
adhere by

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,519
and helps create a more welcoming

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,000
community so

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,560
it also provides documentation in case a

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,120
complaint

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,480
is issued against an individual on how

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,480
to respond appropriately to that

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
and then finally resources and training

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,959
so ambassadors need to know what they're

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,440
talking about

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,600
um we like to provide content for this

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,160
in the form of slides recordings demos

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,160
that they can use in presentations

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,320
as well as monthly calls where we help

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,920
familiarize them

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,959
on what's new with the technology and

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,959
help train them on it

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,120
all right so then there's some

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,560
additional elements in the day-to-day

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,079
management of the community

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,600
i'm going to talk through these a little

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,639
bit more high level today than i

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,279
typically do

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,480
but i'm happy to dive into these further

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,720
if anybody is interested after this talk

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,800
so first is the application barrier or

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,040
sorry the application process

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,120
and what we typically do with this is

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,920
figure out the lowest barrier to entry

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,800
so

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,519
for us it's a google form but keep in

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,000
mind

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,519
um that can't be accessed everywhere and

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,639
if that is the case for the tool that

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,000
you choose

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,839
make sure that there's an alternative

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,240
process in countries where this might be

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
blocked

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,639
um so after that then it's time to set

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,000
up some review sessions with the

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,759
decision making committee

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,440
and decide a couple of things so how

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,279
many applicants can you reasonably

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,800
accept into the program

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,800
based on resource and budgetary

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,959
constraints what are the admissions

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,560
periods going to be for your ambassadors

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,480
and then what qualifies someone for

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,759
acceptance because having these clear

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,560
review cycles and

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,199
requirements with status updates helps

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,959
sedex

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,720
help set up expectations for the

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,079
community

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,320
and then they know when to accept a

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,680
response and what a reasonable

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,680
acceptance period looks like

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,480
onboarding so i typically do this three

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,320
different ways one is with a detailed

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,920
welcome email and this is everything

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,040
that the ambassador needs to know to get

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,959
started so

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,600
this is where you can reiterate the role

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,800
expectations and code of conduct

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,600
um a monthly onboarding call so um

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,240
this is you know just great to get some

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,720
uh

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,519
not necessarily in person face to face

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,679
time but

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,160
talk to the ambassadors live get to know

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,360
them do an actual onboarding call

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,760
live over over a call

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,520
and then onboarding deck so it's a lot

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,039
of information to take in up front

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,039
especially in an email

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,880
so i like to also reiterate this in an

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,520
onboarding deck so ambassadors can go

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,199
back

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,199
and reference that at any point

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,400
monthly on monthly ambassador meetings

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
so for cncf

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
we used to do these as exclusive for

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
ambassadors where they're a

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,160
mixture of project updates as well as

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,240
knowledge share so example

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,720
a couple of ambassadors can come on and

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,080
share meet-up best practices

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,080
for kong we do them a little bit

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,679
differently um they are not specific

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
to kong champions but they are actually

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,720
for the whole community

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,200
we do them one of two ways so it's

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,360
either a demo from community members

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,559
on open source technologies outside of

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,200
kong

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,559
or a kong project update with demos from

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,400
our engineering team

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,480
and sneak peeks on upcoming releases

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,320
we're also working in a global community

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,880
so i like to make sure that we have

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,799
clear channels for communication they're

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
not just for updates specifically but

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,240
also so ambassadors can connect with

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,080
each other as well

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
so things like private and public slack

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,960
channels an email alias

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,640
a github repo for info that requires

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
more transparency and accountability

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
within the community

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,080
and then discourse for things like

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,880
evergreen questions that impact other

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,880
users as well

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,880
um and then finally special perks and

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,640
benefits of the program we talked a lot

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,520
about incentivizing your contributor

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
pipeline

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,799
but i'm also always thinking of ways to

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,400
remind our ambassadors that

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,160
we really appreciate what they're doing

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,880
for the community

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,200
so this is things like ambassador swag

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,880
we make sure ambassadors have

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,440
custom swag for all the events that

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,320
we're at at cncf we used to do front row

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,720
keynote seating for ambassadors

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,320
face-to-face meetups anytime we are at

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,799
an in-person event

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,720
things like a happy hour or breakfast to

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,120
give them that vip experience whenever

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,280
we're face to face

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,200
at cncf we had free access to exams and

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
workshops so ambassadors can take the

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,039
cka

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,960
and ckad exams at no cost to them

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,720
and then meet up reimbursements and

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,360
sponsorships if that's something within

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,360
your budget

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,120
so i'm sure this list will continue to

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,000
grow but this is just a snapshot of some

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,160
of the ideas

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,160
of more tangible perks of these programs

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,400
so finally i want to talk a little bit

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,400
about measuring success

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,160
because at the end of the day what the

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,320
higher ups care about

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,760
are what the business impact of the

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,559
program is

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
so the problem with that is oftentimes

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,679
developer advocacy and ambassador

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,559
programs can be really hard to

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,559
communicate the impact of so i like to

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,480
specifically measure the impact of each

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,640
program

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,400
um another thing i see it's oftentimes

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,400
really easy to measure output

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
for example the number of blog posts put

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,159
out by an ambassador

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,600
but i personally prefer to measure

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,720
quality over quantity

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,720
so a few examples of this are

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,559
the growth of the number of ambassador

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,440
applications and then how many of those

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,440
are converting to actual ambassadors

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,039
number of unique blog post views on

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,080
content written by ambassador so

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,679
basically how many

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,760
individuals are you reaching with that

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,600
piece of content

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,000
meetup attendance i like to do this

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,080
almost as a cpm model for example

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,240
so how much did it cost to get in front

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,919
of x number of people

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,000
which kind of math-wise looks like the

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,679
cost to send the ambassador there

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,159
divided by the number of people who

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,600
attended um i also like to set a

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,039
baseline with this compared to other

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,840
events like trade shows you probably

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,720
have this number for trade shows as well

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,120
already

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,960
and then finally downloads this is

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,640
really my ideal way to measure if you do

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,919
have a setup in place to attribute your

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
marketing efforts to

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,120
downloads um your marketing or community

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,280
efforts but

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,840
this is really difficult to do in open

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,840
source i know

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
all right so with that that's all i have

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,480
for today i know this is a lot of

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
content to go through in the last 20

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,000
minutes

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,600
um so i'll make sure to put the

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,679
slides up later with more details after

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,880
this but we have a few minutes left now

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,880
if anyone has questions

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,799
all right so we having one in here um

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
this is a great question so

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,080
how effective has hacktoberfest been to

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,000
getting permanent

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,440
contributors and um this i will say

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
we definitely have a spike in

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,400
contributors um

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,760
during hacktoberfest and i

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
don't know the exact numbers off the top

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,640
of my head but um

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,159
you know not all of those are going to

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,960
stay around as permanent contributors

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,400
for sure

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,840
but happy to look into what the actual

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
number is on that for you

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,799
awesome um so another one in here is

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,280
recommended tools for measuring success

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,919
so my advice here is actually use

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,120
whatever

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,720
you have in place already um

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,120
you know assuming you might already have

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,840
things like google analytics

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,240
some type of social media management

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,480
tool i try to keep it really

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,320
you know just really in line with what

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:27,840
other members of my team are using so

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:27,840
we're kind of speaking the same language

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,240
another question in here is for those of

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,240
us who are just in the beginning what

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,640
should be the um

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,440
the main focus so um in my opinion what

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,360
that should be

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,280
is figuring out you know kind of who

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,159
your star contributors

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,520
contributors are already um so who are

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,000
the people in your community that you

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,520
want to build this program around

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,559
um and sorry i'm making the assumption

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,360
here um about ambassador programs

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,280
um and then also researching the other

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,280
programs out there so what are the

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,480
you know are there relevant technologies

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,000
in your space that already have an

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240
ambassador program

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,120
um how can you kind of differentiate and

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,120
expand on that

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,520
all right well i think that's all we

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,799
have right now

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,880
