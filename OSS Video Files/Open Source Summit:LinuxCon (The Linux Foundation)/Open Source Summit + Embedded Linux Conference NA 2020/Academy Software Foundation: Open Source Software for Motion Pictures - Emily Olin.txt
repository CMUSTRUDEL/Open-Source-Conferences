hi

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,240
everybody um i'm emily olin

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,400
i am the director of marketing and

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
communications for the academy software

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
foundation

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,880
um and i'm here to tell you about the

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,080
use of open source software in the

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,080
motion picture industry

00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,960
[Music]

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
so

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,719
okay well we're going to keep going

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
there's still issues with the video but

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,280
it is available on our website it's our

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,160
sizzle reel that shows a bunch of um

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,360
open source

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
within motion pictures so um

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,399
today i'm going to kind of take you

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
through what the history is

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
of the foundation why it was formed a

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
little overview of our projects in the

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,719
community and

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,719
how you can get involved

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,520
so um open source software has a long

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,600
history within the motion picture

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,439
industry at least 15 years

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,439
so within the linux foundation while

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,600
there are a lot of verticals where

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
open source software is completely new

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,479
like for example automotive is just

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,000
getting into it

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,240
um motion picture industry has been

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,640
using open source for a really long time

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,240
and it's the backbone bone for a lot of

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,159
the software that they create especially

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,159
for visual effects and for animation

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,840
so about um a couple years ago so the

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,360
foundation launched in 2018

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,079
and it was based on a two-year

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
investigation that the academy of motion

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,240
picture arts and sciences

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,240
their science and tech council did into

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,399
the use of open source software across

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,240
the industry

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,079
and what they found was that 80 percent

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,520
of the industry was using open source

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,880
software especially for

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,520
animation and for visual effects

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,200
but this widespread use had led to some

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,200
challenges that were inhibiting

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
sorry about that looks like we were

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,440
having some audio

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,560
and technical difficulties um i realized

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
that it was a little bit choppy

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
audio going in and out so i'm going to

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,599
back up a few slides

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,239
um just to recap the foundation was

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
launched in

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,280
2018 after the academy of motion

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,200
pictures arts and sciences

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
their science and technology council did

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,640
a two-year investigation

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
into the use of open source software

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,920
across the industry

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
and what they found was that 80 percent

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,840
of the industry was using open source

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,200
especially for animation and for visual

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
effects

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,800
but this widespread use had caused a lot

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
of challenges

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,239
and they needed to address them in order

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,040
to have a healthy ecosystem going

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,800
forward

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,239
and these were things like very

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,239
different governance and licensing

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,760
models different from project to project

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,440
studio to studio silo development

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,879
and also things like when a project

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
maintainer would leave a company or

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,760
leave a project

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,159
the projects would then go stagnant for

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,159
a while

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,000
so thus they brought in linux foundation

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,400
and formed

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,360
the academy software foundation so it's

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
a neutral forum

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,360
for open source software for motion

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,000
picture and broader media

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,760
um especially for animation and visual

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,959
effects

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,480
a place for cross-project crop studio

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,480
collaboration

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
a lot of which was difficult before

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,040
without having a neutral

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,040
party to manage it

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
and so some of our goals you can see

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
especially

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,040
are around continuous integration and

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,440
our build infrastructure

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,200
creating a clear path for participation

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
to make it easier for people to get

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440
involved

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,280
especially through like consistent

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,720
licensing um

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,440
and through clas and then new for this

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,599
year

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,120
are also we're working at creating more

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,519
working groups and exploring

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,360
new projects and larger projects and

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,799
also a big focus is on diversity and

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
inclusion

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,000
and raising the profile of software

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,360
engineers in the industry because

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
they're often described as kind of the

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
unsung heroes

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,360
of the industry

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,600
um so here's kind of our membership and

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,919
over the past two years our membership

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,799
has

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,400
pretty close to doubled um and we have

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,600
achieved a lot of the goals we saw on

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,080
the last screen

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
you know and um we actually within our

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
first year hit

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
one million in revenue

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,800
so like most open source projects we

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
our government governance model includes

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
our governing board

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
which is responsible for a lot of the

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,639
budget decisions

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,600
um the high level strategy uh things

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
like that

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
at the heart of the foundation is our

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,720
attack so

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,160
um all the members have representatives

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
and we also have some industry

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
associates as part of it so our

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,199
technical advisory council

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,000
they make a lot of the technical

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
decisions they facilitate a lot of that

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
cross

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
project collaboration and they're

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,680
responsible for

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,360
voting on and approving new projects

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,160
that come in and working groups that are

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,759
formed

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
and they also identify like if there are

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,680
resource gaps or things that are needed

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,759
and then underneath the attack all of

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
our projects operate very independently

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,880
and they each have their own

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,240
technical steering committee which is

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
made up of members from

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,919
many different companies and they have

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,600
their own communities so they have their

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,520
own roadmaps that they kind of report

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,039
in underneath the tac and then all of

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,080
them share a continuous

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,080
integration platform

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,720
in addition to that we have our working

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,560
groups which also report up to the tac

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,000
so we've got our continuous integration

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,440
working group

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
new this year we've launched several

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,360
working groups so our usd

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,639
working group and usd is a project

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
that's hosted by

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,120
pixar and so that working group is

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,720
really looking at how do we support the

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,000
project and help with a lot of like the

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
incoming questions

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,240
um and channels like that uh our python

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,759
three working group that is

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,840
helping to kind of ease the transition

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,199
from python 2 to python 3 for a lot of

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,280
our projects

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
and then neo actually launched this past

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,000
month is our

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
diversity and inclusion working group

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
so our diversity inclusion working group

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,440
which is our newest one um

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,680
diversity is an issue obviously across

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,160
everywhere and it is really bad within

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,280
um visual effects and animation and even

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,639
kind of something that needs to be

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,000
addressed even more so within open

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,080
source communities

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,039
and while our project has a code of

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,800
conduct and they

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,639
we all do our best to be inclusive and

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,479
diverse um

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,840
there's a gap missing in terms of how do

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,080
we get that people more

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,680
into the projects and more into open

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
source and aware of it and level the

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,639
playing field

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,240
um so that's what you know the diversity

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,160
inclusion working group

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,919
is aiming to do we had our first

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,280
kickoff meeting last month we had about

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,720
40 attendees

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,720
um you know people joining from apple

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,360
dreamworks image works uh disney

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,880
dmg you know there's a lot of passion

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
for it and a lot of excitement and it's

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,520
a group that i think will be able to get

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
a lot done

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,800
um so right now we're still trying to

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,199
hammer out what are the goals of the

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,319
group

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,000
and how we want to tackle them um

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
it looks like it's we're probably going

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
to have a big focus on mentorship and

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,479
also

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
you know how do we engage university and

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,400
high school students to kind of

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,319
bring them into visual effects and

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,800
animation and especially open source

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,800
software

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
and so and this group is you know open

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,199
to anybody so please feel free if

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,759
there's any interest feel free to join

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,880
and you can sign up um you can read more

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,560
and on

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,080
asws.i diversity inclusion

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,280
and there's a link on there also as well

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280
to sign up for the mailing list

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,599
late last year we also published our

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,440
academy software foundation landscape

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,520
you may know a lot of the other lf

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,840
projects have similar landscapes so this

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,759
is based off of the one by cncf

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,879
um and there used to be one that lived

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,479
at use opensourcevfx.com or dot org

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,160
um so we've kind of transitioned this to

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,680
become the landscape

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,639
trying to build it out and get a lot of

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,639
projects to submit

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,199
now our projects so the first project

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,479
that we

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,319
adopted was openvdb

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,240
and it was also our first project to

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,800
graduate to adopted status

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
it was developed by dreamworks and it's

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,760
a c

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,680
plus library for volumetric

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,200
representations so

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,279
things like ice fire water

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
liquids things like that it's been used

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,560
on you know movies

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,080
um like how to train your dragon

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,440
crews boss baby trolls

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,080
um a lot of different films like that

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
anything where there's a lot of volume

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,360
essentially

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
um the project has seen a lot of growth

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,680
they've had three code releases over the

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,680
past

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,839
year and they're actually gonna have a

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,519
big um a lot of new technical features

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,279
coming up this summer

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,880
um so whereas this was originally a

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,560
dreamworks project they've

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,080
got a lot more renewed interest a lot

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,519
more contributors from

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,080
autodesk nvidia side fx dmg

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,800
um and this is a you know a fairly

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,959
well-known

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,920
project within the foundate within the

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,240
industry

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,760
um and actually won an academy technical

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,680
achievement award which is

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
the academy of motion pictures arts and

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,600
sciences gives out

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,600
client science by tech awards

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,440
essentially and so they've won that and

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,880
it's like the academy awards for visual

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,880
effects animation and technology

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
the second project that we adopted was

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,120
open color i o

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
so they joined um in the beginning of

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
and that was developed by sony pictures

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,080
imageworks

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
um and it provides a like a color

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,200
management solution so

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,959
it ensures that your colors look the

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,600
same across many different

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,959
applications and different environments

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
because that's essential when you're

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,000
creating a movie

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,720
and so it's very widely adopted

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,560
and it's used across most studios and

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
within vendors

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,079
it's been on used on movies like

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,320
spider-man

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,680
men in black jumanji first man

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,120
avengers pretty much most image works

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,800
movies um they have grown a lot as well

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,079
since joining the foundation

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,320
they um have a lot more contributors

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,320
they support the aces which is the

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,360
academy color encoding system

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,240
and they now have a rep on the ocio

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,839
tfc that also is for aces there's a lot

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,360
more collaboration between the two

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,160
groups which is great

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
um and then this was a project that when

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,320
actually the

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,760
original developer left the project is

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
stagnant for a while

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,160
until maybe a year until you know until

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,200
later contributors revised it

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,079
uh in early 2018 um so that kind of can

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
go to show how

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,320
a project can lapse without having the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,279
proper governance and support structure

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,880
in place

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,959
and so now they're actually gearing up

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,200
for v2

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,399
a code release coming in a couple months

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
which will be a really big

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,800
major release for them and that's being

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,800
led by autodesk

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,920
our third project was openq

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,279
and this um was kind of a little bit of

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,120
a different term for the foundation

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,200
whereas the first two projects were very

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
widely known and well adopted across the

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
industry

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,360
openq was a newer project so it had it

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,920
joined in april of 2019 and it was

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,320
actually just

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,240
was announced and released in june in

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
january of 2019.

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,800
so it was developed at image works it

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,240
was an internal render farm which is for

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,279
managing jobs and shops and then um in

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,440
collaboration with

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,959
google cloud they developed it as open

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,959
source as open q in january 2019.

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,800
so before that it had been used for

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,240
years at image works you know on

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,240
hundreds of shops

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,160
it was definitely production proven but

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,440
it was new

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,360
as an open source project um

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,959
and so they've had a lot of releases

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
over the past year

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,720
um and a lot new contributors coming in

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,240
from with netflix

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,519
microsoft amazon and they are working

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,880
towards they're currently on the

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,639
incubation stage and they're working

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,160
towards graduation

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,160
or graduating to adopted stage

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,120
next up is open esr so this was

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,639
developed by

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,200
industrial light magic for ilm in 1999

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,120
this was kind of the very first release

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
of an open source project by a studio

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
and

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,800
really kick-started the trend of open

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,760
source projects

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,600
for visual effects and animation um so

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,480
it's an image file format for high

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
quality images

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,760
especially things that have a lot of

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,160
contrast um it's been

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,959
used on every single ilm film you know

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,279
for the past

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,600
since probably since 1999 so all of the

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,040
especially the star wars film

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,240
um and so anyways you can see a couple

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,560
of missions there

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,920
and uh pretty much every single movie

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
today uses it

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,600
um so it also won an academy technical

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,720
achievement award

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,440
um and it's had a lot of contributors

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,160
assistants join the foundation uh disney

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,120
animation

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,920
image works epic games what uh pixar you

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,839
can read that

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,839
and they um have a new release also

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,839
coming this summer

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,920
so our fifth project to join which was

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,959
last summer

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,040
was open timeline i o so our goal

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,320
originally had been to

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,680
essentially get openvdb open colorio and

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,959
open exr

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,959
when the foundation launched those were

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,639
the three we knew we wanted to bring in

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,920
um there were a bunch of other projects

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
as well but that was kind of the goal

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,279
for the first year which we achieved

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,240
and plus we brought in open queue and

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,320
open timeline which is fantastic

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,680
so um this one joined last summer it was

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,160
developed by pixar

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,079
and it's an interchange format for um

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,160
editorial data things like clips

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,440
timing tracks to pass all of that data

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
throughout the pipeline

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,959
for create for visual effects and

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,480
animation um and this

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,480
is still in public beta they just

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,199
released their beta 12

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,880
this past march

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,360
then open shading language is actually

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,399
our newest project we just adopted it

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,279
um in april so a couple months ago it

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,760
was developed by

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,680
image works and released an open source

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,160
to open source in 2010 so it's been

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,880
around for a while it's the de facto

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
standard

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
shading language for vfx and animation

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,399
so um almost

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,600
all applications support it and you know

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,399
it's got widespread

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,880
use um so they're still kind of getting

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,480
ramped up and you know moving over

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,560
repositories and everything but we're

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,920
very excited to have them on board

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,240
um you know and this is actually the

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,000
second project that we that imageworks

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,519
has contributed to the foundation

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,199
which kind of goes to show that they've

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,639
seen a lot of benefit and

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,120
seen the growth that the projects have

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,880
had as part of the foundation

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,880
to want to contribute a second one

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,399
and i think for what we're finding too

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,399
is that

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,079
the community of open source software

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,759
developers within motion picture

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,800
is fairly on the smaller side and you

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,440
end up with a lot of

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,920
people working across many projects and

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,480
so

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,240
you know by being able to bring on more

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
contributors it kind of frees up a lot

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,480
of the original maintainers who have

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
been

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,519
you know working on this project and

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,920
devoted that to them for years and kind

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,600
of

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,839
eases off a little bit of the burden as

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,839
well

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,759
so how to contribute and get involved

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,480
there are many different ways you can

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,079
get involved

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,880
um you know you can you know submit

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,680
testing

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,240
join our tsps for any of the projects we

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,839
have a meeting calendar on our website

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
as well as the tac all of the tax

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,800
meetings are open and we encourage you

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,399
to attend i know it can sometimes seem

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,360
intimidating but even just joining and

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,880
listening in

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,440
or joining in on the mailing list um

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,839
you know we one of a lot of the projects

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,680
are in need of better

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,320
documentation and technical writing or

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,600
looking for feedback from users and for

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
test cases so that's

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,519
a way pretty much any project if you say

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,880
hey i want to get involved i'll say

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,160
great

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,000
you know i want to talk to you about

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,480
what you can do or you know what you

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
want to do

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,079
and so these are kind of our main

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,000
mailing lists

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,959
we have a slack channel at black.aswf.io

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,519
github behind the screens is a new

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,440
feature

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,279
we launched last year where we highlight

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,160
a lot of the software engineers

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,639
in the industry it's a q a on our blog

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,079
um

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,680
so if you are currently a user or

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,199
contributor to open source software

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,400
within vfx animation

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,079
and want to be featured please send unit

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,959
and then we've got our youtube channel

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,959
and twitter as well

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,319
so coming up we will have our open

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
source days

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,760
so this is something we launched last

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,559
year um

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,400
in in at the same time mr graph in

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,919
conjunction with photograph

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
there's a full day of birth of the

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,280
feather sessions for open source

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,000
projects for cfx and animation so we had

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,200
our own projects but plus we had aces

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,840
res materialx all giving presentations

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
um and before where all the projects had

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
been

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,600
scattered throughout the week and it's

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
hard for people to get to them we wanted

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,400
to

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,720
host it all in one place to make it easy

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,640
for 12 percent engineers to attend

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,840
um so this year we are going with

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,840

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,919
over the past

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,640
