00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,600
mission

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,239
of sodak foundation after that

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,440

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,719
will talk to you

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,680
about the project you so

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,399
from china unicom will talk to you about

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600
why ig

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,120
projects then vivian

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,320
from intel will talk to you about

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,440
outreach committee each person will

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
speak for

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,039
about 10 minutes for a total of 40

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:13,840
minutes

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:13,840
with 5 minutes left to 2a

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,840
okay in 2016

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,360
del emc fujitsu hitachi

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,400
huawei intel and vodafone

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,880
funded opensvs

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,360
we got increasing requests during

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,479
discussing opensds

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,920
and many companies including toyota

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,280
joined to open sds

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,200
with the majority support of open sds

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:53,280
members we are transforming the project

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,560
into solar foundation so the foundation

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:08,479
is a home for open source data

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:11,599
and storage projects

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,640
as you can see many major companies

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,200
joined to solder foundation

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,280
the soda foundation provides an open

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,640
collaborative and neural home for

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,920
project stakeholders to coordinate

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:36,879
development and community investments

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:40,640
in the soda ecosystems

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,239
the mission of soda is

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,519
to foster an ecosystem of open source

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,959
data management and storage software for

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:55,840
direct autonomy to offer a neural forum

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,560
for close projects collaboration and

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,560
integration

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,840
to provide end users quality and

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
to end solutions

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,680
today there are many challenges such as

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:20,239
data silos non-standard interfaces

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,760
sports solutions and something like that

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,640
because our environment is being to more

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
complexity

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,120
i actually used to work for yahoo japan

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,959
corporation

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:38,000
as a principal storage architect

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,879
there were hundreds of storage systems

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,159
and several petabytes of storage devices

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,680
there

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,959
managed mainly by me

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,080
in fact we were operating with only

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
three people

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,799
including me

00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,159
as shown on this right we had no choice

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,799
but to avoid increasing some number of

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,080
storage

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,959
types as mixing different

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,840
models are necessary makes management

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,280
more complicated

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,720
that's why even if there was a product

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,639
we were technically interested in

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,199
we couldn't easily introduce it

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,240
this is a very sad story of missed

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,840
opportunities

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,840
to gain experience as an engineer

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,479
anyway it can be said that the

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:40,000
configuration described in the side

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,680
slide not only lead to complicated

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,680
administration

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,040
increased operational costs and locking

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:57,040
but it also takes away the

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:59,919
opportunity to even take new initiatives

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
soda is a single data framework

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,400
connecting

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:08,400
different solutions into seamless

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,639
end-to-end solutions this framework

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,840
is open source allowing any developer

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,600
vendor or end user to build

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,600
and expand upon it

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
if we had solder when i was at yahoo

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,840
japan

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,039
corporation even there were only three

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,560
operational members the operational

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,280
load would not be too high and

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,840
we would be able to take on new

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
challenges

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,000
soda is an open source unified

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,360
autonomous

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,800
framework for data mobility from

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,080
edge to core to crowd

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,000
the key highlight is open source

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:07,840
standardized standardization ecosystem

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,840
and certification

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,800
so the foundation is overseen by the

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,440
governing board

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,560
and supported by the technical steering

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,680
committee

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,160
and user advisory committee and outreach

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,039
committee

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,039
technical steering committee lead

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,440
touring project

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:34,800
and overseas collaboration with upstream

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,479
end user advisory committee is a forum

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,880
for end-user companies to discuss

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:46,400
and exchange information on use cases

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,520
and request requirements and to

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:54,599
provide feedback on solar testing

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,479
outreach committee overseas emerging

00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,840
evangelizations

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,840
communications outreach events

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
and training

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,160
from now k sunuki from ntd communication

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,319
will take over and talk about the

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,360
projects

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,360
so please get started your session

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,840
can you hear me

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:45,840
okay so hi um this is

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:45,840
cake it's not key

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,560
so i'm i'm chair of the technical

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,440
healthcare community

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,240
working on energy communication and

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
today i'd like to introduce the project

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,280
to

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,280
minnesota

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:15,680
so we we were formerly

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:19,280
open to this as we are changed to soda

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,840
we organized our development activities

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,840
and when we filled the project left we

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,840
made a three project

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
category

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,519
um the first is

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,919
core project um

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,360
that is mainly opens this development

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,320
activity

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,279
for a project to deal with fundamental

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
center part of

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,200
data internally at either naturally out

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
architecture

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,920
like well

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
okay

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,160
okay uh sorry um

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,160
the first is core project and the core

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,760
projects deal with fundamental

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,600
center part of data automate

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,000
architecture like north

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,120
and south bound api programming storage

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,120
infrastructure management

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,000
et cetera um it is initiated by

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
formerly open cities community and now

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
governed by solar

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,160
community of course every sort of

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,880
release will contain new core project

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,640
futures

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,680
over improvement next is native project

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,880
this category is for donated project

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,959
that was developed by

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,760
third party or soda member soda welcome

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,920
new storage project to open data

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,120
autonomy ecosystem

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,800
we support this native project um to

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,760
work with corporate

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,920
but the original organization can govern

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,000
the project independently

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,080
and they can choose whether their

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
software version is pushed to solve all

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,399
release

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,519
for example next for example uh g

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,640
release and we we are now uh

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,760
f leds uh so now uh let me

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,839
uh talk about example for example g

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,480
release has new future from native

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,760
project

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,279
but the next hdd stone doesn't have

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,360
anything it is optional to

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:30,720
uh it is optional to follow solder leds

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
and those have is echo project as you

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
know

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,279
there are so many open source projects

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,279
that are deal with so that

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:43,279
stress data directory in directory

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:47,519
so to achieve open data ecosystem

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:50,160
it is significantly important

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,959
that these open source software can use

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,480
soda

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,279
work with soda so we make echo project

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,320
category for such open source project

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,360
and to show

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,800
that we are trying to build

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,000
soda ecosystem together uh of course

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,640
uh echo project is managed governed by

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,560
other open source community and don't

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,800
follow social medias

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,200
but so the community will support

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,959
specific use case or integration

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,959
or something so

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,640
okay so this is the landscape

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,959
of our project top lines echo project

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,839
currently we are working on two projects

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,279
of eps

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,320
and kuber edge and the middlewide native

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,800
project

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,440
yig became solder native project

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,240
donating their code to soda

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,200
uh it will be introduced later by though

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,680
you

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,639
additionally linstor and zenko have

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,000
discussed to

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,320
the joint finally our bottom line is

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,279
core project we have api controller

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,480
image cloud

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,399
plugin dock dashboard etc um

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,519
let me explain core project xing

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,639
so the architecture overview so this is

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,760
a solar architecture overview

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,720
in soda architecture poor project

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
is located at the center it's a kind of

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,639
hub

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,040
from northbound kubernetes openstack

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,959
vmware platform or any other

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:31,279
application can use soda a su api

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,920
um the plugin and to sales band

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,040
soda will occasionally translational

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,480
strategy

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,760
and software defines range and

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,279
in terms of east west bank

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:50,720
soda from data lifecycle management

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,720
through march cloud like aws azure

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,160
google

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,880
and next

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,000
so here is a list of essential core

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,360
projects

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,079
and so

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,920
yeah we are of course we have more

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,760
dashboard of us

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,360
infrastructure management or something

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
like that so

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
and

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,079
this is the detailed diagram about

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,600
architecture

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,680
i wanted to explain it but unfortunately

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,240
i don't have enough time today so

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,680
advanced session about core project and

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,639
architecture

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,279
will be will be provided in soda mini

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,320
summit

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,920
right july 2nd

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,519
i appreciate it if you could join it

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,920
okay lastly

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,519
i'd like to talk more about the native

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,600
project

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,839
as i said uh yig is only native project

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,519
and we are discussing with zenko and

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,000
linsor

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
while we have kept trying to make new

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,040
friends

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,639
we are working to crystallize soda

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,680
incubator program

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:09,279
so this program has governance

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,320
policy for each project it covers the

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,160
proposal process growing process label

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,600
process and the accept time

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,480
idea for each stage besides this program

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,199
we will also considering uh concluding

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,079
the benefit

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,040
and support from solar foundation by

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,279
this program

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,839
we hope to continue expanding solar

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,959
ecosystem

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:36,079
playstations the final part is uh

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,959
yeah actually it's kind of a handover to

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,519
uh you though uh so this is the yig

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,120
project

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,600
so the representation is next stock so

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,240
yeah thank you thank you so much for the

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,240
listening so

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:59,839
so usual are you okay to

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,839
the presentation

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,199
and today i will introduce our eagle

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
product

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,880
and i will introduce these from

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,839
two pounds

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
is

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,399
and second i will

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,680
i will have an intro i will introduce

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:23,680
the architecture

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:26,160
on some basis

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,440
in the early stage we use the staff of

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,639
readers giveaway as

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,880
our objective story stories but along

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,000
with our business growth

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,279
we meet some problems for example if

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,279
there are too many cells in the bucket

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,320
it will take take longer time to return

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,120
to list

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,480
objects in the bucket this will slow

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,880
down the request

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,759
of the of the user and also in a

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,440
larger step cluster if we do some

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,160
important intention

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
of the server

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,520
the back the recovery and backfilling

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,480
will introduce some

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,559
proper cross-system performance and will

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,880
it will slow down the user request

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,880
also

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,120
because reader speedway can't share the

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:24,000
catch it is really difficult

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,880
to use the single cache in the real

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
quick

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,799
so at that time we tried to find some

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
solutions

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,360
and some solutions to download

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,039
but unfortunately within the uh we did

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,080
we didn't get a solution

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:44,840
in the real speedway so we decided

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,840
to develop a project that is

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
eager

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,000
in each product we make better pooling

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,360
performance for metadata

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,039
because all the metadata are simply

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,039
and many management by

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,799
and all some other authoritarian

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,280
functions such as law of statistical

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,400
capacity and user authentication

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,440
are moved to other systems and also

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,200
many instances can share the

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,520
same central catch and also in it

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,080
and also this improves the cash

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
performance

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
and

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,280
this is the architecture of the eagle

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,200
eagle can management

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:02,240
many multiple step clusters

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,440
so the deaf culture in giga

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,400
uh does the seven clustering year

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
chapters does that provide the basic io

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,400
storage

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,720
and all the metadata are still in ego

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,919
and

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,000
management management many many managed

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,400
by eagle in the bottom there are

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
several characters and they are

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,160
management

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,360
they are managed by eagle class eur

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
cluster

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,360
and all the metadata are saved in kdb

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,360
content

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,400
we use type b for our

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,000
metadata management but

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,600
you can use your theoretical databases

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,160
system because the ego has abstracted

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,600
the interfaces for the methodist

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
management

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,520
and also for us for authentication you

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,200
can write your

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,320
authentication plug-in and plug and

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,840
place it in the ego and reviews of your

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,840
authentication coupon

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,840
and therefore you go method data

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,760
currently we saw the received metadata

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,200
include idp and because idb

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,480
is a distributed database system

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,600
and combined with my circle

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,520
there is no low number limitation in a

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,880
single single table

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,280
and it is very easy to to confirm with

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
pen

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,480
extension so

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,520
the list object in thai in

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,600
new year will take a short time

00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,559
than that in widow's gateway and

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,960
by using this kind of mess method

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,159
without the problems we meet

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,159
in the real estate way

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,799
and for file processing ethereum

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,240
classify two kinds of files according to

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,679
their site

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,320
we will each will handle the small file

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,720
and this kind of small file can be saved

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,559
in

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,919
a whole inspector with replicate

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,200
with replication enabled and uh another

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,760
tunnel

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,799
is the last file the last file can be

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,840
saved in

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,880
stamp pro with easily enabled because

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,960
using easy

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
we can feel the story just based

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,640
and that's all from eagle project and

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:13,840
welcome to usa

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:13,840
and try it thanks

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,720
okay i'll start uh here's vivint i'm

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,640
based in shanghai and

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,799
this is early morning okay so

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,640
session and currently i'm working for

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,480
the intro

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,480
storage domain and today

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,559
oh there's some delay to switch the

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,559
pages okay so hope you can switch

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,080
okay so yeah today i will talk about the

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,640
solder global community

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,000
including what is solder foundation and

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,120
solar governance

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,159
and also power the global outreach com

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,720
committee community and so

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,679
our major focus today for this session

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,799
is more about

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,440
the outreach committee we will also look

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,600
back

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,799
key events happen to or organized by

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,760
outreach committee

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,559
and happening in the last one year so as

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,960
introduced

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:23,840
at the beginning by uh yuji that you

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,840
know solar foundation is uh

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,240
ecosystem of open source data and

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,559
storage software for this autonomy

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,520
and you can see that there are many

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,840
custom many

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,880
companies joined at the foundation of

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,600
the soldier

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
and including china unicorn fujitsu

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,080
toyota

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,240
uh huawei and many other companies here

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,120
i will not just go through them one by

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,320
one

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,159
and so and if you look at organization

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,559
uh i'm gonna show the foundation you can

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,960
find

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,320
actually we have uh there are three

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
major uh commits

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,559
here committees here to support it

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,559
including their technical steering

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,240
