that we could manage

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,000

tirelessly working to unwind

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400

hard effort over the last few months but

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,560

shore things up our next

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,120
priority as an organization aside from

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,640
dealing with winding down our events was

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,239
to make sure that we kept

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,439
all of our folks at the foundation busy

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,159
you know as many of our event industry

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,080
peers were being laid off we were

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,680
training our staff to work on other

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720
parts of our business to make sure we

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,519
could keep them all

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,440
busy and employed and boy they really

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,600
have stepped up i just want to thank

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,800

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
the work they do

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,520
and hopefully our communities can see

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,560
the impact that those folks have had

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,560
i'd like to also thank our sponsors

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,080
boards of directors members and

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,040
community members who've helped us

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:43,840
through this time

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:43,840
through working with us on

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,240
so finally once we've stabilized our

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
organization

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,759
restructured uh the way we run our

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,039
events

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,479
we asked ourselves at the foundation uh

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,479
how we can help and so

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,400
what we've been doing over the last few

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,400
months is looking for quiet ways where

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,840
the linux foundation can help

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,639
in this global crisis the first thing we

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,720
did was we

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,880
expanded our mentorship program to

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,360
provide opportunities for

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,560
folks who've been displaced uh from

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,800
their jobs i

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
want to give a particular shout out and

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,759
thank you to melissa evers hood from

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,360
intel who started off uh in

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,560
contributions that are

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,919
now totaling over 350 000 with a

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,680
250 000 dollar donation uh

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,960
to sponsor more mentees to come through

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
our summer

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,880
mentorship program in addition to

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,000
expanding our mentorship

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,800
program uh our open mainframe

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
project introduced a cobol training

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
course

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
this may be surprising to some but many

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,280
of the unemployment systems throughout

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,080
the united states

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,560
haven't been updated in a while and were

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,840
written

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,479
in cobalt and required a

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,240
series of maintenance in order to cope

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,400
with the increased traffic

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,160
on those systems as unemployment in the

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
united states soared

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
and we're really proud of the open

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,680
mainframe project for helping with that

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:31,520
um the virtual event pivot we've

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,199

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,280
platforms

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,039
we are going to uh when they say you

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,120
know when life gives you lemons make

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,600
lemonade we are going to actually make

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,960
virtual event platforms a part of all

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,960
our future physical events as well

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
so we're happy to have gone through that

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,759
process and now

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,280
we'll be able to reach so many more

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,520
people in the future

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,120
even as we get back into physical events

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,800

we were very impressed that there really

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,479
has been a shift across

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
the industry when it comes to open

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,479
source from

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,440

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,080
a huge increase in the number of folks

who really are not traditional tech

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:32,000

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
hundreds of scholarships for millions of

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,200
dollars worth of specialized technical

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,600
training

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
to those who may not have the ability to

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,560
afford this kind of opportunity

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,480
otherwise

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,200
uh this year the linux foundation

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,720
awarded scholarships

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,920
uh to 500 of the more than uh

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,800
1200 applicants who vie to be selected

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,880
in one of ten categories uh this year's

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:51,839
selected pool of talent represents the

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:51,839
potential for great

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,560
seasoned tech professionals uh who will

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,079
receive this

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,680
your scholarship uh and be able to work

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,360
across our open source communities

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,240
next we have a special announcement

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,079
about our spdx

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,680
standard spdx is a specification that

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,519
helps uh to track open source software

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,240
and really any software for that matter

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,240
across the software supply chain

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,480
and today we're announcing that the

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
latest version of spdx

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,680
uh it will be the second linux

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,200
foundation

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,240
standard submitted to iso jtc1 for

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
approval as an

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
international standard the linux

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,760
foundation

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,640
is a iso pass submitter uh and has

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,279
been able to take our projects from open

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,360
source repo to international standard

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,320
uh through this process and we're very

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,160
excited that spdx has become the second

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,240
uh specification that we're submitting

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,600
to iso for international

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,160
standardization next i'd like to

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,920
announce

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,079
our jdf community specification

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,160
at the linux foundation we're making a

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,320
lot of strides towards

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,640
working on standards development

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,360
combining the best of open source

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,000
and the best of open standards to extend

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,519
the reach and usefulness of open source

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,680
through uh standardization for

00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,480
interoperability

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,399
and more the jdf joined the linux

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,720
foundation about a year ago

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,760
and has brought its successful program

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,000
of streamlined

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
project setup governance and standards

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,600
to develop

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,279
uh for our greater community today we're

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,279
announcing the latest innovation coming

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,640
from the joint development foundation

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,720
the ability for the jdf and the lf

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,200
community specification program

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,959
to incorporate terms procedures and

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,800
templates required for the development

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,639
of technical standards

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,519
it provides contributors an easy free

00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,560
repository based approach

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,440
for uh specification development

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,920
this will be the simplest and quickest

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,000
way

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,160
for a collaborative effort to start its

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,800
journey to becoming an

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,200
internationally recognized standard it

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,760
allows technologists to collaborate with

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,320
very little overhead and to succeed and

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,240
grow

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,639
all with the seamless support of the

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,440
joint development foundation behind them

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,440
next we want to announce our open

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,240
network automation platform

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,880
frankfurt release this is the sixth

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
release

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,519
of the open network automation platform

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,000
and it furthers the open network

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,040
automation

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,680
platform's position as the comprehensive

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,000
platform

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,240
for orchestration management and

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,360
automation of network and edge computing

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,480
systems

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,440
onapp is really the defacto standard for

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
the world's

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,000
global network operators cloud providers

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,399
and telecommunication providers

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
and we're very proud of their sixth

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,680
release

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,720
next we have a new announcement of a

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,880
project in

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,560
our uh ai uh foundation

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,160
uh it was announced last week that

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,920
databricks spark at

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
databrick spark and ai summit that they

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,760
were donating ml

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,600
flow project to the linux foundation

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,320
ammo flow's mission is to provide a

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,959
platform

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,760
for machine learning life cycle

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,320
management

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,440
and more it includes experimentation

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,560
reproducibility

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,279
and deployment for machine learning

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,399
applications since its introduction two

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,600
years ago

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,800
mlflow has experienced an amazing growth

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,079
in its community

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,240
with over 200 contributors joining

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,760
it has been downloaded more than 2

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,040
million times a month

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,199
and has a 400 annual growth rate

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,959
in the amount of downloads and usages

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,959
we're seeing out there

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,560
databricks made the choice to bring ml

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,560
flow to the linux foundation so that

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,399
they have a vendor neutral place

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,440
with an open governance model to help

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,680
broaden the contributions to animal flow

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,680
and make that project grow even more

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,680
we're very excited to have them

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,160
here and uh last but lat not least we

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,959
have

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,199
an announcement uh that didn't make it

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,600
with a slide for the cut off but

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,279
uh is worth mentioning the confidential

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,480
computing consortium

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,440
uh is announcing today that they have uh

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,959
grown their membership over 60 percent

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,800
in the last nine months

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,440
the confidential computing consortium is

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,680
dedicated to finding and accelerating

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:45,839
the adoption of confidential computing

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:45,839
new members and now

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,800
looks like we lost jim uh my name is jr

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,519
storment i'm president of the phinops

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,839
foundation and

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,279
we were also he was i think announcing

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,279
at that moment that uh we are going to

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,839
be joining the linux foundation uh

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,839
as well uh so we're excited uh to do

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,480
that a little bit about why we're here

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,639
so

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,880
it used to be that when a platform team

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,519
needed to get access to hardware

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,560
right pre-cloud they would need to go to

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,480
their procurement team

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,160
right and the procurement team would

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,600
work with them on a business case

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,199
and eventually they would get the money

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,839
they need for resources

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,199
right and this this process involved

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,680
essentially engineers

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,720
as requesters and finance uh and

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,199
procurement teams

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,959
um as approvers and this process took a

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,120
while it went long procurement cycles

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,160
and high cost of engineering product

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,839
projects with failure so in the devops

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,320
world right now you've got all these

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
individual service teams who are going

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,399
to

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,480
uh their procurement teams making these

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,160
business cases in order to get the money

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,680
so this process unfortunately takes a

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,360
long time or took a long time until

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,639
cloud came into the play right now

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,800
engineers are writing

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
infrastructure as code in order to

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,519
instantly get access to the resources

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,839
they need

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,520
so this is really great in a lot of ways

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,240
for engineering teams to move more

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,439
quickly

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,640
for projects to be more dynamic but the

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,880
business folks in the finance

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,839
procurement teams have less visibility

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,000
and spend is often has a lot more waste

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,720
involved

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,160
so phenops is essentially a operating

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,799
model for this world

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,880
of cloud where we're bringing together a

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,440
prescriptive set of actions

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,039
best practices and culture that enable

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
these teams these disparate teams like

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,120
engineering teams finance teams

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,480
i.t and business teams to come together

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,400
to get the most

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,320
value out of every dollar that they

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,840
spend in cloud

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,440
so when phanops has implemented an

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
organization you have a much better

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,559
model where these engineering and

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,760
finance it teams are all working

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,280
together as one

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,039
to get that instant procurement of

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,720
resources that cloud delivers

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,039
but also to ensure that you've got

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,320
predictable costs and budgets

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,520
with a low cost of failure so the fenops

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
foundation

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,120
which will be joining the linux

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,760
foundation this month uh has three

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,600
primary

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,799
goals as its mission the first is to be

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,880
the central community

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,320
for cloud financial management we host a

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,919
lot of virtual events we have a very

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,880
active meetup community and slack

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,320
community

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,320
and we're doing all this to the second

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,559
point to advance the careers

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,360
of finnops practitioners a lot of our

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,559
members

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,320
are engineers a lot of them are in

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
finance a lot of them are an i.t it's a

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,960
diverse group with a lot of different

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,720
titles but they're all working to get

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,240
better at cloud financial management

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,160
so we offer training certification

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,360
career development there and the third

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,280
piece which we're really excited to

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,760
collaborate with the linux foundation on

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,760
is to start to open source a lot of the

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
standards and best practices that this

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,960
group

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,799
has pulled together the foundation

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
launched about a year ago and we've had

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,760
some really great growth uh in that time

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,559
we have over 1500 members now

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,360
representing

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,200
uh companies of giant enterprises and

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,840
tech unicorns all around the world and

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,200
we we've taken a lot of the best

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,280
practices that these companies

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
and individuals have shared and put them

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,559
together into

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,840
resources like the o'reilly cloud

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,919
phenoms book

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,600
which launched early in the year as well

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,000
as a certification a number of

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,120
other things we're very excited also to

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
announce today

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,120
that thanks to the linux foundation's

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,160
training team there's now a free

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,200
intro to phenops course uh available on

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,039
edx

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,559
so we're excited to be part of this uh

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,000
new growth uh the team at linux

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,679
foundation has been

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
massively helpful a big shout out to

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
chris anisic

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,200
from cncf for all the support in this

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,480
process and looking forward to growing

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:39,840
with this community

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:39,840
thanks so much

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,919
jim can you hear us i think i'm almost

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,919
all done here

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,679
thank you very much uh there jr uh

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,280
and uh we uh are happy to uh have you

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,360
on board uh our next announcement we are

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,480
introducing the sota foundation

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,200
previously open sds they are expanding

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,840
to include

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,679
both open source software and standards

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,799
to support an increasing need for data

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,039
autonomy

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,720
the soda foundation hosts an open source

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,240
unified autonomous data management

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,240
framework for data mobility

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
hello

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,840
all right

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:46,159
all right i think we lost jim

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,240
hello everyone good morning

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:53,360
um i'm 710 the um

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,679
chairman of soda foundation

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,520
all data challenges are demanding and

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,159
that's the purpose of soda

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,080
to bring a community of people together

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,159
to address these challenges

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,159
let's take a look at some examples

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,159
this is the toyota connected car

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,960
platform it needs to handle massive

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,520
amounts of data comprising videos

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,520
sensor data and map data so there are

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,760
many requirements for this platform

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,640
for instance we need data lifecycle

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,799
management

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,880
to manage the flow of data from tier 1

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,120
storage to tier 2 storage

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,919
and from tier 2 storage to code storage

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,919
and to the clouds

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,720
this platform also requires other stuff

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,600
like data integration

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,520
and data security and so on and there

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,640
are many challenges on this platform

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,840
this big so for example how do you

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,080
avoid data silos and data fragmentation

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
how do you prevent vendor lock-ins in

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,919
terms of the software

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,520
the hardware and the cloud and how do

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,840
you integrate everything together and

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
make them work together seamlessly

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,679
toyota is a member of the

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,000
soda eoc the end user advisory committee

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,200
the committee is a mix of companies from

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,400
different regions and

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,480
industries it serves as a forum for

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,440
users to share their ideas their

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,559
challenges and use cases

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,400
when toyota shared their use case

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,720
many other members actually mentioned

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,520
that they face the same issues

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,159
so what we are hoping to do in solar

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,400
foundation

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,440
is actually by bringing these users

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,760
together

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,760
we can address these issues better

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,400
the soda open data framework is an idea

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,200
that came off from the

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,200
user's input

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,320
the idea of this this open data

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,200
framework is to actually

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,960
try to address the many issues or uses

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,799
cases of our users

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,120
the goal is to let users build

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,640
end-to-end solutions easily

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,559
and the framework connects data

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,480
end-to-end from platform and

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,760
applications down to storage

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,400
from age to core to cloud and it

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,840
and it connects all the and it manages

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,280
all the data in between

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,520
and takes care of things like data

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,600
protection data lifecycle management

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,520
and so on this framework is open source

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,000
and it allows vendors to integrate

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,000
easily

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
so the solar vision is actually to

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,120
deliver

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,760
a highly autonomous data framework to

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,440
improve

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:42,799
operational efficiency and to do that

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,120
we need to do infrastructure integration

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,840
integrated data management and then

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,679
finally the autonomous data management

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,039
currently we are doing a developing a

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,000
mix of

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,799
one and two and the result is the soda

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,799
ferro release

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,600
so solar ferro release is the

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,320
1.0 version of the open data framework

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,159
ferro addresses what i call the abcs of

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,159
data challenges

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,360
a is the annoying challenge which is the

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,919
platform

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,440
whenever there's a new platform many

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,159
things in the infrastructure needs to

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,960
change to

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,840
interface with this new platform so with

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,960
this framework

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,480
what we do is that the soda plug-in is

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,279
the only thing that interface with the

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,760
platform

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,200
so if there's anything that changes in

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,080
the platform or if there's a new

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,559
platform all that

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,760
thing that needs to change is the it's

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,480
the plug-in

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,960
and everything else in the effect in the

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,080
infrastructure can stay the same

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,320
next is the boring challenge which is

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,840
the storage piece down below nobody

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,520
likes to deal with storage

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,919
so what we've done is that we've

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,320
abstracted storage to make it easy for

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,279
platforms and applications to consume

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,480
as a service and the last challenge is

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,200
the common challenge

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,440
that every user faces and this is the

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,600
multi-cloud piece

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,799
every user has a multi-cloud strategy

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
right now and

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,320
this framework provides a single

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,520
interface to connect to the different

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,440
public clouds

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,520
and you can do things like migration

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,120
across clock different clouds

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,120
and daylight life cycle management

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,279
across different clubs too

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,240
so soda ferro has many other great

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,919
features

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,840
and it's available today on our github

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,840
for

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
download

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,000
so the foundation is also trying to

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
foster

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,679
an ecosystem of software for data

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,440
autonomy

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,080
and today i'm happy to announce that

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,279
china unicom has donated a

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,679
in-housing project to solar foundation

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,039
it is a massively scalable object

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,360
storage project

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,559
that's storing about four petabytes of

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,919
production data

00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,400
in china unicom and to help

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,919
with help the growth of geek and other

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,039
projects

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,520
what we are doing is that we are

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,279
creating a soda incubator program

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,760
to accelerate its development and also

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,279
adoption and we welcome other projects

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,279
to join solar foundation too

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,080
as jim mentioned soda foundation is a

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,880
transformation of the

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,360
open sds project the companies you see

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,799
here

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,120
came together to help with this

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,760
transformation and i'd like to thank

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,480
each and every one of this company and

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,159
especially

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,200
the premier members china unicom fujitsu

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,159
huawei entity communications and toyota

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,159
motor corporation

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,720
i'm grateful today to be

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,720
given this opportunity to announce the

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,640
launch of soda foundation

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,559
the picture you see here is of the uh

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,520
soft launch in tokyo when

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,240
last december so without this community

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,120
of people

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,080
is this would not be possible i also

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,679
like to thank

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,559
jim dan khan mike dolan ethos on our

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,840
advisor and many other folks at

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:18,400
linux foundation for helping to

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,400
to make this a success thank you very

all right let's see all right

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,200
so for most folks the cloud native

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,080
computing foundation

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,399
is a household name at this point um

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,960
just

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,640
as a refresher it hosts critical

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,600
components of global technology

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,640
infrastructure

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,440
it started off with our flagship

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,840
project kubernetes and today has a lot

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,559
more

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,159
to offer in in addition to kubernetes

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,600
there are many more household names in

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,880
the foundation such as

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,480
prometheus fluentd uh jager

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,799
envoy the list goes on cncf

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,600
brings together the world's top

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,240
developers

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,279
end users and vendors and runs the

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,360
largest

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,720
in-person open source developer

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,120
conferences

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,600
i think most folks are familiar with the

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,760
kubecon cloud native cons that happen

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,960
the cncf is of course a part of the

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,799
linux foundation

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,720
and hence why i'm here a quick

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,600
i'll get i'd like to give folks a very

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,919
quick background on my journey so far

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,200
i started my career at google many years

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,159
ago

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,360
and had a pre-cloud native part of life

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,159
where i worked in tech

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,360
but in in different areas then the

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,039
startup bug bit me

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,360
and i ended up working on developer

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,480
tools which i instantly fell in love

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,480
with and i knew

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,559
that anything i do further must be

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,120
closed to software development

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,200
and infrastructure i had the opportunity

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,600
to work on the open tracing project

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,360
which was the third project to join the

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,640
cloud native computing foundation

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,960
in 2016. that was a special fun

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,240
time everything was new and we were

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,320
talking about things like

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,960
what are microservices what is container

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,000
orchestration what is kubernetes

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,480
a lot has changed since then of course

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,480
after participating in the ecosystem as

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,279
an educator contributor with open

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,159
tracing

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,440
i when i joined the company git lab i

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,320
was elected to serve

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,640
on the cncf governing board that was a

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,000
really useful experience for me because

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,679
i got to see

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,880
how the leadership dan khan and jim

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,080
dan khan jim and chris ran this

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,799
massively impactful organization

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,679
having had that experience when i was

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,120
called upon

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,279
to lead cloud native computing

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,399
foundation it was a true

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,799
dream come true a major thanks to

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,600
jim zemlin dan khan and chris anistek

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,480
for seeing

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,760
the possibility and bringing me on board

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,720
i am very thankful

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,360
and i'm so happy that i get to be cloud

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,039
native

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,039
100 of my time now

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,919
so how has the cncf been doing

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,720
we all hear about all the projects we

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,360
hear a lot

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,440
but what are the numbers like well i'm

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,240
so happy that i get to tell you

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,799
we have 571 member companies

00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:06,080
144 of which are end user members

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,279
that is a special aspect of pride for us

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,000
we actually uh enjoy the largest

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,519
end user member community in of all

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,919
foundations

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,799
and that is really useful and important

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,360
because as

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,919
jim said when he was speaking there is a

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,840
shift

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,960
where end users are getting deeper and

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,440
deeper involved

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,960
they are taking on bigger technology

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,200
decisions they are building cool

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,200
projects and the more representation and

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,279
involvement we have the better

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,960
we have 28 graduated and incubating

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,480
projects uh which

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
i've already told you some of the star

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,919
names uh we

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,840
we're always looking for amazing

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,799
technology that can benefit our

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,039
ecosystem so

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,559
if you are ever thinking about a project

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,679
that needs a neutral home

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,279
with good governance and support from an

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,760
experienced staff

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,519
please consider us actually it's a

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,399
moment it's a matter of pride for me

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,480
that just

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,720
last week the technical oversight

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,200
committee was able to approve 11

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,960
projects for our sandbox which helps

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,519
those projects have a neutral space

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,600
where

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,440
different companies can come collaborate

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,279
it's awesome

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,039
and the final result i would like to

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,279
mention is just that

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,159
coupons they are the largest open source

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,200
conferences

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,840
in uh physical conferences in the world

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,880
and i am so excited for the all the work

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,120
we are all doing

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,720
now to pivot to virtual and then

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,919
eventually when we'll all get to be

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,799
together again

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,080
in person in some awesome location but

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,840
as jim said

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,840
with a virtual component

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,519
so what lies ahead dan and chris have

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,120
done an amazing job for cncf

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,880
and we all stand on the shoulders of

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,039
giants um

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,039
what lies ahead is also exciting it's

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,000
the second wave of cloud native

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,320
as i mentioned there's a deepened focus

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,720
on

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,840
end users we want to work with them as

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,120
much as possible

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,799
to help them support them enable them

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,799
um there are many initiatives that are

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,000
coming out my colleague cheryl

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,159
hung she has just released the cloud

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,240
the end user tech radar which gives

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
great advice to folks on what projects

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,280
are good

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,879
uh and what people are experiencing not

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,040
just project but technologies in cloud

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,200
native are

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,879
performing in end user experiences so

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,760
these are deeper insights

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,599
we're also as i said look always looking

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,760
for amazing projects that is

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,879
that can help the ecosystem and keep

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,280
building upon

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,560
this amazing platform that we have as i

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,720
said the sandbox

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,960
process has iterated and there are lots

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,720
more we're constantly working so

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,960
what is true today will be new and

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,000
improved tomorrow and then onwards it's

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,800
always be iterating in this bright

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,720
future

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,159
of course virtual community building is

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,720
a large part of it

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,760
and you will see just as open source

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,839
summit today

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
kubecon eu has gone virtual and is going

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,599
to be held in august

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,480
i highly recommend you folks come me and

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,320

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,960
we're all working together to give you

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,000

so i just wanted to call out

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,680
who are we at the end of the day the

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,640
cncf

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,320
and largely the linux foundation as well

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,520
we're foundation of doers

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,000
and builders we can that's what we all

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,359
have

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,640
in common together i would say

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,079
we're all team cloud native i encourage

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,640
you to keep this mindset

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,560
as you whether you're getting started

um deployed to kubernetes many times who

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,160
uses onwa who has all the complexities

and you can learn a lot more about how

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,960
cloud native technologies impact end

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,760
users

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,960
when she bakes sourdough with end use of

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,520
pinterest

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,560
so that's all from me thank you so much

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,960
for having me

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,560
and thank you jim for giving me this

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,839
opportunity

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,280
gab gabe colombro uh he is

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,839
the executive director of phoenix

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,160
for those of you who may recall uh the

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,680
phenos foundation was announced as a new

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,240
linux foundation project

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,119
last month today gab is here to tell us

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,640
about the phenos foundation

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,040
welcome thank you jim

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,720
and thanks everyone for having us here

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,480
um i'm really excited

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,760
this is my first time here at the open

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,640
source summit so

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,760
really uh again thanks everyone for

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,320
attending and

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,040
thank you jim for the opportunity before

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,040
we get started a little bit of

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,359
disambiguation um i'm really excited to

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,880
have heard the phenoms foundation being

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,280
launched we are finance

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,680
just to make sure you guys are not

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,359
confusing with the names

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,000
so many projects in the linux foundation

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,720
that we're running out of names

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,480
second point i want to make is open

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,200
sourcing financial services

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,560
used to be almost an oxymoron until a

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,280
few years ago

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,359
and that was certainly my initial uh

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,720
reaction five years ago when i had the

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,440
honor to be called to

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,359
run the finance foundation but the truth

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,680
is the banks have been

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,560
consuming open source for the longest

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,920
time

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,680
and not only consuming but over the last

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,280
few years we've seen

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,240
major in-roads towards contribution um

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,160
we're proud to uh feature the goldman

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,359
sachs contribution last year

00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,800
a huge uh contribution of their uh uh

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,040
logical modeling platform we're seeing

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,560
increased contributions from giants like

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,000
morgan stanley

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,720
jp morgan city in our foundation

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,160
and even techcrunch is looking at the

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,920
next fintech

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,680
decade being completely different than

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,880
what we're experienced

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,400
to date um there's an interesting

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,920
article that got published just

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,160
a couple of weeks ago from our gold

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,599
member red hat talking about how banks

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:31,520
should contribute to upstream and we

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,880
really exist to create new upstreams in

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,680
financial services

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,640
and so over the last four years i'm

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,520
really proud

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,480
to uh you know and thankful to our

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,200
community

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,280
to have come together in a very complex

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,839
industry like financial services with

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,880
very specific requirements around

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,920
compliance really through the hump

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,520
of contributing to open source um

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,119
you've heard priyanka you were jim

00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,119
talking about end users

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,440
we have been an end user focus

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,440
foundation from the get-go

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,359
i want to send a special shout out for

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,640
platinum members of course

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:12,000
uh uh you know provide us

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,599
the the support uh um to continue

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,599
growing the foundation

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,480
over the last four years we built about

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,880
40 active or incubating projects we have

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,040
a community of over 300 contributors

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,920
and i think what i'm mostly proud of is

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,839
the

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,359
cross-pollination that we're seeing

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,119
between

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,000
you know tech companies and financial

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,480
services institutions

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,240
and so before we move forward why is

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,200
that why is this industry

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,960
looking at open source uh very much like

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,079
any other industry has done as you folks

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,720
know over the last 20

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,240
years well i think there are three main

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,280
reasons here

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,320
the first one is financial services

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,599
has experienced starting 2010

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,000
a shrinkage of their margins

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,720
some data research firm says that about

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,839
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,680
billions uh uh less revenue

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,319
in the top line there's been since the

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,800
2010 crisis that's almost like jp morgan

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,200
and goldman sachs would just disappear

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,200
and from the bottom line standpoint

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,280
regulatory spending has increased

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,920
drastically over the last 10 years again

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,400
so effectively there's not

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,319
enough or infinite amount of money to

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,599
continue throwing at software problems

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,640
and that's where open source

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,200
can play a really key part um

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,319
the second point is again talking about

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,680
pack vendors and

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:35,520
and end users in this industry the line

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,079
is keeping on getting more and more

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,400
blurred every financial institution

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,599
is increasingly looking at behaving and

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,800
running their business

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:47,760
as a technology company and that means

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
not only uh you know bringing in all the

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,920
tips and tricks

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,480
from here from the west coast but also

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,000
uh

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,839
getting over the hump and the

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,520
complications of being a regulated

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,599
industry

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,040
with all the you know access to talent

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,720
and again

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,240
changing drastically the way you run the

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,560
organization

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,520
and then number three um you know the

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,400
move to cloud

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,880
um as we know in the broader community

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,040
uh

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,960
the the way we deliver software and we

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,960
create business around open source has

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,079
been drastically changed

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,880
by uh the cloud

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,359
we are seeing the same process happening

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,760
in

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,599
financial services with new business

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,720
models and of course the fintech wave

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,720
creating

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,319
a completely different way of delivering

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,440
software and open source is playing a

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,760
huge part in there but let's

00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,839
contextualizing it

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,880
a little bit when it comes to looking at

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,920
the financial services stack as we said

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,920
we've always seen

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,000
open source being part of the financial

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,000
services stack and

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,680
the challenge here is to move from

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,720
consumption

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,400
to contribution and if you look at if

00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,839
you go and break down a little bit that

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,000
stack you'll see that

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,480
of course there's a set of general

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
purpose platform and operating systems

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,760
that we've been collaborating in the

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,520
open source community for

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,200
decades but there's a whole

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,119
layer of technology that is very

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,880
specific to financial services whether

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,319
you're talking corporate banking

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,160
retail banking or wealth management

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,839
both in terms of integration and data

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,359
standardization and that's where the

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,280
finance bread and butter

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,760
is we think there's huge amount of

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,839
potential to collaborate in the open

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,880
that's why we're very excited to work

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,000
with jim and the team

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,160
to join the linux foundation because

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,079
with this very powerful partnership we

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,359
can actually cover the whole stack

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,000
and enable firms to also become active

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,119
uh

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,560
upstream contributors let me give you a

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,160
couple of examples let's be a little bit

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,400
more concrete as to

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,920
what we do in finos over the last four

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,079
years we've seen

00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,400
uh projects originated from

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,359
financial services companies like our

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,160
forming project

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:05,440
alloy contributed last year by goldman

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,880
sachs

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:11,040
our high throughput data streaming

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,920
visualization library contributed by j.p

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,240
morgan called perspective

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:21,160
open standards like our fdc3 standard

00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,280
and more compliance specific

00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,800
industry-specific projects like our

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,280
cloud service certification

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,000
again bringing together the need to go

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,160
to cloud

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,440
with an open source approach to bring in

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,520
the regulators

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,599
into this conversation so we think

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,599
there's a huge potential here

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,760
and if i look at the broader uh

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,359
landscape uh trying i'm not gonna go

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,839
through all the projects here but if you

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,000
see

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,240
the combination of our projects in

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,400
phenols with the upstream

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,319
uh uh you know very key components for

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,680
this industry like electron node and

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,520
hyper ledger

00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,560
we can see a huge potential from a

00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,040
project standpoint to grow our community

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,200
uh our communities through

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,880
cross-pollination

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,160
not only that but of course we're super

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,079
excited what you can see as we

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,440
join the linux foundation as we merge

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,680
our operations

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,720
uh we're looking to expanding globally

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,000
we're looking to

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,520
bring in uh the the stellar training

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,560
team from the linux foundation

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,400
to help us certify our projects

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,880
we're going to be announcing our joint

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,640
events a little later in the year so

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,280
stay tuned here

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,680
and most importantly as i said we want

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,800
to

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,240
enable banks to become conscious

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,280
upstream contributors couple of

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,640
uh announcement before i i close

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,200
um we just launched our first

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,359
beta version of our landscape if you're

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,560
familiar with cncf or lfai

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,000
you'd know they have a beautiful

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,359
landscape of their projects if you go to

00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,359
landscape.venus.org

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,040
that's going to be our landscape moving

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,560
forward we welcome and encourage

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,640
contributions so please

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,319
check it out you got the github link

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,680
there

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,599
and as we look forward uh one area where

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,400
we think will play a huge role is what

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,520
we call open source financial regulation

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,359
we think open source can be a third way

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,839
in the constant struggle between

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,440
regulation and deregulation

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,359
in a way that we can bring in the

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,280
regulators in the conversation and

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,520
ultimately they could partake to the

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,079
open source process in actually defining

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,760
regulation and enforcing regulation so

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,319
please stay tuned on this channel

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,240
there's a huge opportunity we think

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,160
uh to bring together regulators and

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,359
financial services industry

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,560
and so closing um i just want to leave

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,400
you with that

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,000
whether you're a financial institution

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,520
whether you're a fintech vendor

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,880
whether you are a regulator

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,720
or whether you are just a tech vendor um

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,560
there's a huge opportunity here and

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,359
we're not just talking about you know

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,200
efficiency cost savings you know your

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,240
typical benefits of open source

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,880
we think that as a user and as an end

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,880
user of the financial services industry

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,880
you can help us through open source make

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,680
a change also in areas like financial

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,520
inclusion

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,359
esg and so many sort of bigger

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,960
goals that we can achieve through open

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,280
source and with that

00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,800
i want to thank you jim and the whole

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,800
linux foundation team for this

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,800
opportunity

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:33,040
all right thank you gab and again

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,440
welcome to the linux foundation family

00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,800
of projects we are so happy to have you

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,720
here

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,040
our next speakers require little

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,680
introduction as their fireside chats

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,319
have become a mainstay of this event

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,319
please welcome dirk handle vp and chief

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:53,200
open source officer at vmware

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,200
and creator of linux and get lena's tour

00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
balls

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,640
there we are that was surprising that we

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,400
had an interstitial

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,640
good morning everyone my name is dirk

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,000
rondell i'm the chief open source

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,400
officer at vmware and

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,000
you are and i am linus torvalds

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,400
and uh this is a very strange

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,079
new model of doing conferences for me

00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,599
but let's see how it works we've had a

00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,400
few technical issues but

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,680
this is hopefully going to work fine oh

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,000
it's going to be wonderful

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,160
the the lag between the two of us is one

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,839
of the things i'm most worried about

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:38,960
so linux5.a

00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:42,240
what a massive rc1

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,839
i am i am surprised and then as i

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,319
thought more about it

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,880
maybe this is a covet thing are people

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,800
at home

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,599
not traveling they have more time to

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,800
work on this stuff

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:59,119
i don't know it it might be um

00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:02,559
but honestly i think we've for the last

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,359
uh three years or so uh kernel releases

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,800
have been

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:10,720
fairly stable size wise and there's been

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,559
a kind of up and down that has

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:17,359
just depending on timing and i suspect

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,119
5.8 might be because of people staying

00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,599
inside but it might also be

00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,200
that it's just happened that several

00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,119
different groups

00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:30,160
ended up coming at roughly the same time

00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,720
with new features and 5.8 ended up being

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,000
surprisingly big for that reason but the

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,440
last time we had such a big

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,240
kernel really was when when we let it

00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,880
slip that the next curl would be an lts

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,559
kernel

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,800
so there was clearly a reason and and

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,000
anyway i mean i obviously we won't know

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,480
but i i found it

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,559
fascinating just how big this is and the

00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,920
rc you did yesterday was also

00:48:52,559 --> 00:49:00,000
massive yes i mean

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:03,520
that was actually not that unexpected uh

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,559
with a big merge window i would expect

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,880
that the first few

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:11,359
rcs are also fairly big with people

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,880
finding problems and fixing issues that

00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:15,359
they introduced

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,520
rc2 usually is pretty small because

00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,559
that's the com period after a merge

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,839
window

00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:25,280
uh but then rc

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:28,400
three through five is when you

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,280
usually see all the major issues being

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,680
cleared out

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,040
and right now i don't know what will

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,440
happen

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,440
it's too early to tell this might be one

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,960
of those releases that because it's

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,359
large we will end up having to delay

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,200
the final release and give it one or two

00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:48,000
more rc's than usual

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,599
but but who knows so far things have

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,440
actually be pretty smooth

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:57,119
i'm doing this on my laptop running rc1

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,520
because that's that's the way i want to

00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,280
work

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,760
i if i can't trust my own merge window

00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,040
then

00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,359
then i'm doing something wrong so i i i

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,520
like

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,640
i like your your approach to bravery

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,079
that's nice

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,599
um so covet has obviously been a huge

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,000
disrupter for a lot of us

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,839
and and and so one of the things that

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,319
i've been wondering about how this has

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:24,079
been for you and your family this is

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,760
the first time for me since 1994

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,200
that i've been in the same place for

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,319
four months in a row

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:33,680
my family i think is getting tired of me

00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:37,119
how is that for you and your family

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,599
well to be honest

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,920
it hasn't changed that much literally

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,960
this conference right here

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,720
is the first big change

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,720
uh i do not like doing video conferences

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,119
i have not done a single video

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,079
conference so far during the last four

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,960
months

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,480
and and the fact that it seems to be

00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,839
working at all

00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,319
frankly surprises me uh but

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:05,119
the way i normally work i work from home

00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,200
i

00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,400
work sitting in front of the computer

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,520
reading email

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:15,440
and i'm happy to say that so far

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:17,440
it looks like none of my co-developers

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,119
have been hugely impacted either

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,680
i was actually worried for a while

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,760
because one of our developers was

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,680
was offline for for a month or two

00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,040
and and everybody was kind of one

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,240
wondering what was going on

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:35,440
and it turned out that was just rsi

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,200
and rsi is kind of an occupational

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,640
hazard but it had nothing to do

00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,880
with with the current pandemic

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,720
but i mean one of the things that is so

00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,599
interesting about the linux community is

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,880
how much it has always been email based

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,400
and remote

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,960
how how rarely we get together in person

00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,200
we have a couple of conferences the key

00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,160
maintainers once a year for the kernel

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,599
summit

00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,359
so the only big impact on the kernel

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,839
community is that you and i can't go

00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,839
diving

00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,559
that may not be the only impact people

00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,079
see but

00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:15,839
but it certainly is one of them yes

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,839
so i i don't want to make this a

00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,960
political conversation obviously this is

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,800
about technology

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,640
but one of the things that i found

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,599
striking when i look at the cloud native

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,760
community about

00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,079
cncf we see a significantly larger share

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,640
of

00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,960
black contributors and leaders kelsey

00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,800
hightower brian lyles stephen augustus

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,200
there are so many of them

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,920
and i i don't think i'm seeing that in

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,079
linux

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,240
is that just me not seeing the right

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,440
people or are we

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,599
less racially diverse than some younger

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,760
foundations simply as a function of

00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,319
the time when we all started almost 30

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,319
years ago

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,359
honestly i don't know i mean and i don't

00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:00,400
know on two different levels

00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:03,599
one is i do suspect you may be correct

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,720
that a lot of the people who are

00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,640
in low-level technology are the kind of

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,280
people who started

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,920
several decades ago and and that's how

00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,800
they got

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,240
into the whole low-level hardware

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,520
interfaces and

00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,960
getting into operating systems but the

00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,119
other reason i don't know

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:28,319
is that i literally don't know

00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,520
i do not meet with these people i

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:34,480
uh for all i know half of the carnal

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:38,880
community could be

00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:41,920
not white i don't

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,960
i i never see them i don't do the face

00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,359
to faces

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,359
i do know that when it comes to the

00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:51,280
chord maintainers that i meet

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:54,480
once a year we are obviously

00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,520
a very homogeneous crowd

00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,400
but but i don't even know about all the

00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,599
new developers

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,240
we have every single release we have

00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,119
over a thousand developers uh quite a

00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,040
lot of them

00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,480
we have over 2 000 and i do not know

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,520
what the

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,880
what what the people involved are or if

00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,400
they are even a people

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,079
or for a while you know for

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,079
all i know some of the patches being

00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,200
sent out are sent out by artificial

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,119
intelligences that people are trying out

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,640
and here was saying that you were hoping

00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,559
it was dogs because

00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:35,599
dogs are always nice dogs are never evil

00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:38,799
let's move off of that topic no no

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,240
don't go there um so so much of what

00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,960
everyone's talking about if i look at

00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,240
the last

00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,599
uh hour of this event it's all

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:51,839
higher up in the stack cloud segment

00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,680
specific technologies like fintech so

00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,680
stories of linux's demise are

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,280
exaggerated right we continue on

00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,480
everything is growing this

00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,280
continues to be the os everyone talks

00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,119
about right

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,720
or colonel i should say well

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,160
i'm certainly not seeing anything go

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,000
away uh

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,520
but at the same time i do want to say

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,880
that for the last

00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:17,359
over decade i've told people that no

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,480
kernels are not the future that if

00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,040
you're looking for

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,920
a new exciting project to get involved

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,240
with

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,839
maybe you should not be getting involved

00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,079
with the colonel i mean the the kind of

00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:29,839
things we're doing are

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,520
i wouldn't say they're the same that

00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:35,040
people did in the 60s

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:39,680
but but the basics of

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:42,480
a modern operating system are still

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,839
reminiscent of what was being done in

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,319
the 60s

00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:48,559
so one of the things i'm still very

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:51,680
surprised about is

00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,880
how many people we have and how many new

00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:57,440
people we get

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:59,760
every release and not just

00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,799
not just people doing new things and new

00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,079
drivers we

00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:05,440
are like in 5.8 which is looking to be

00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,559
one of the biggest releases

00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,440
ever a lot of the changes people are

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,640
doing

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,480
is literally very fundamental stuff

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:19,839
being cleaned up and fixed and improved

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,440
so kernels should be something that you

00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,960
take for granted and that you don't

00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,720
really have to think about

00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,640
but at the same time it there is a lot

00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,240
of interesting technical work still

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,720
being done that's still going on

00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,760
and i just noticed that the sun has

00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,240
moved and it's

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,839
right in my face and i can't see

00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,640
anything

00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,119
well i you're certainly well lit right

00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,160
now

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,200
um so you said there are things that are

00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,720
still interesting

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,280
other times when we talk about this

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,799
topic you've said that linux is boring

00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,240
and that's how a colonel

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:58,720
should be now if i if i look at this

00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:02,000
question of you greg many of the leaders

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:05,119
are all in a certain age

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,280
range you know many of us have

00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,880
the five at the beginning of the numbers

00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,079
a couple are approaching

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:15,119
the 60s so at some point we

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,799
as a a community need to start thinking

00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:20,079
about generational change

00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:23,119
right so what do we do

00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,960
no time out there i mean a

00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,960
yes i said that the kernels are boring

00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,040
but i really mean that in the sense that

00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,599
a lot of new technology

00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,880
should be more interesting to me and to

00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,440
a lot of other

00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,079
people there is nothing more interesting

00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,200
than

00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,880
interacting at a low level with the

00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,079
hardware and really controlling

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,160
everything that's going on

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,480
so don't get me wrong kernels are not

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,520
boring but on the other hand

00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,680
most people should consider them boring

00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,880
uh the other thing i also i don't think

00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,040
it's true that

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,559
we're getting gray and old i mean it is

00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,599
definitely true that the people who have

00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:01,200
been around for

00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:04,319
three decades by now yes we are getting

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,839
gray and old not so great yet

00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:09,599
uh but it's the light it's all over but

00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:12,880
again

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,240
but again it really is a lot of it is

00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,480
the fact that

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,400
people do tend to stay around and the

00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,079
people who have been around for a long

00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,599
time we have moved into

00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:26,400
maintenance and and management

00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,240
i it's not i don't like the word

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,240
management because i don't think of

00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,440
myself as a manager but

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:37,119
that is realistically what i am

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:40,319
and a lot of the new people

00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,119
who are not 50 years old and not 40

00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,400
years old they

00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:48,160
are still often in college or or

00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,799
just graduated um they are the ones who

00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,280
are often

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,559
doing the real work and and the fact

00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,599
that we have

00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,920
managers and maintainers who who are old

00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,839
and

00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,319
starting to pray that's i think a

00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:03,599
completely different issue

00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,240
but do we have a generation of people

00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:07,119
let's say

00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,040
in their 30s who are moving up through

00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:12,319
the ranks of maintainers

00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,960
so that we have that next wave of people

00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,480
to take over eventually i mean look

00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,400
we've been doing this for almost 30

00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,839
years so we need to start thinking

00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:25,359
the next 10 20 30 years and so we need

00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:28,720
to have that next generation correct

00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:29,280
we do and do we have enough no it turns

00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,520
out it's

00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,520
really hard to find people who are

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,280
maintainers i'm going to try to

00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,280
move a bit out of the sun

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,680
maintainership is it's interesting and

00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,400
it's challenging

00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,400
but one of the downsides of being a

00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,440
kernel maintainer in particular is

00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:54,559
you have to be there

00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:58,079
all the time maybe it's not

00:59:54,559 --> 01:00:01,359
24 hours a day but it is every day

00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,559
you read email you react to email

01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:05,680
you have to just be there and and it's

01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,960
not necessarily

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:12,000
a very easy niche

01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,359
to get into and we do not have enough

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,520
maintainers

01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:17,520
we do have a lot of people who

01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:23,359
who write code we have

01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,359
a fair number of maintainers for being

01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,400
an open source project we have hundreds

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,559
of people who are

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,000
maintainers and that's usually more than

01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:33,440
most projects have

01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:36,400
participants but at the same time

01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,640
the the one gating issue we often have

01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,680
is

01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:42,480
it's hard to find people who

01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,599
really look at other people's code and

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,280
help

01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:50,720
funnel that code upstream to

01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:54,319
all the way eventually to my tree

01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,319
and and that's something which

01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,880
i think we need to continue working on i

01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,880
mean we are working on it but i think it

01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,400
is one of the main issues we have

01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,559
in the whole kernel maintenance tree

01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,000
and a big part of this is of course that

01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,319
it takes time it takes

01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,119
experience you have to have done this

01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:15,440
for a while as a low-level maintainer to

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,520
slowly move up and and then gain the

01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,079
trust of enough people including

01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,920
your trust obviously right right and and

01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,480
i think the key word is the one you

01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,920
mentioned

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:28,319
trust you know it's not just trust

01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,599
from other maintainers it's also trust

01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:32,559
from all

01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:34,720
the the people writing the code they

01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,559
need to see that okay i recognize this

01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,400
name because he's been around or she's

01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,480
been around for a while

01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:45,440
and uh and that just it takes time

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,480
and and this is something where uh 30

01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:50,079
years ago when we started

01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,520
you didn't need that it was like you

01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:56,400
showed up you were a warm body

01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,559
go for it you you got the job right and

01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,559
um

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,760
and getting a very very warm welcome

01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,799
from you

01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,280
yes yeah yes and things have somewhat

01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,760
changed

01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,319
part of it is so many more people now

01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,440
depend

01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:16,079
on the colonel that we can't do

01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,359
the kinds of wild and crazy things that

01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,039
we used to do

01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,880
and and taking patches from you

01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:24,000
certainly counts

01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,319
but but part of it is also that

01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,680
back when we started even fairly early

01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:31,039
on when we were 10

01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:33,760
people when we grew to be 50 people

01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:35,200
it's a different kind of situation than

01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,200
when you have

01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:42,400
2 000 people every release and

01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:45,440
one or two or 200 of them

01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:48,559
need to stand up and be be the

01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,480
maintainer for a subsystem

01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,400
so switching gears a little bit and talk

01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,480
about technology in this space and

01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,839
and something that comes up every once

01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,280
in a while uh

01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,880
it kind of is related to that

01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,640
generational question is

01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,799
no one writes software in c anymore so

01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,760
everything every new project is done in

01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,920
go or in

01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,559
rust or in yet another language that

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,680
i've never heard of

01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,599
is there a risk that we are becoming the

01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,480
kobold programmers of the

01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,480
2030s

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,440
well i don't actually think it's true

01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,920
that nobody writes in c anymore

01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,640
i think c is still one of the top 10

01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,839
languages

01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,000
easily if you look at any of the

01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:33,280
statistics

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,640
that said i mean people are actively

01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,319
looking at especially

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:41,520
doing uh drivers and things that are not

01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:44,240
very central to the kernel itself

01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,680
and having interfaces to do those for

01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,319
example in rust

01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,280
people have been looking at that for

01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:52,079
years now

01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,559
i'm convinced it's going to happen one

01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,599
day

01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:58,720
i mean it might not be rust but but it

01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:01,200
is going to happen that we will have

01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,240
different models for writing these kinds

01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,440
of things

01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:08,480
and and c won't be the only one um

01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,640
i mean right now it's c or assembly and

01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,839
most people would rather not touch the

01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,839
assembly parts

01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,319
it is something that that people are

01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,640
looking at

01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,799
i'm probably the wrong person greg has

01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:25,280
been more involved since he's

01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,880
uh the driver maintainer in general but

01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,920
but

01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:33,200
things are afoot and these things take

01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:36,000
a long long time i mean the

01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:38,160
the kind of infrastructure you need to

01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,799
start integrating other languages

01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,799
in into a kernel that's and making

01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:46,559
people trust these other languages

01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:49,440
that's that's a big step yeah so

01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,000
so to move this even more technical i

01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,680
haven't

01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,240
worked in in computer hardware in a

01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,160
while working a software company now

01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,200
but there was an interesting fun article

01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,240
last month about you building a new

01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:06,000
computer for at home an amd horizon

01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:09,839
threadripper 64 threads that sounds like

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,839
fun it also sounds pretty loud

01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,000
well i was actually worried about that

01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:19,359
it turns out i like my office to be

01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:23,760
completely quiet

01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:26,799
and at the same time

01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:29,520
as kernels have grown especially during

01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:31,760
the merge window when i get

01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,599
like i get hundreds of pull requests and

01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:37,039
i strive to do about 22

01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,880
30 a day which is about my limit

01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,960
just because i need to know what's going

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,960
on it's usually it's not the technical

01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,280
side that is the limiter here

01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,480
for me the limiter is that i need to be

01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,960
able to

01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,400
understand what i'm pulling and and

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,319
what's going on

01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,839
so i can i can do roughly 20 to 30 pull

01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,799
requests a day

01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:00,319
and that means that when i during this

01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:03,119
time

01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,000
in order to do that i need a lot of

01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:07,599
computing power

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:11,280
just to to do the the builds

01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:14,720
and i decided my old machine took

01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:17,280
half almost half an hour well not quite

01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,319
but it was over 15 minutes to build the

01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,440
kernel

01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:23,359
and and i needed to upgrade

01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,240
and i decided i can deal with a machine

01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,559
that is silent as long as it's idle

01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,760
so that when i'm reading email or when

01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,839
i'm responding to issues

01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,200
if it's completely silent during that

01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,039
time i'm happy

01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,119
and then if it starts making that

01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,160
whooshing sound when the fans really

01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,000
come on

01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:47,119
when i start building i i decided i can

01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,720
deal with that if i can make my bills go

01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,960
much faster

01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,880
and and so far i'm being very happy in

01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,079
fact now i'm starting to think i should

01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,640
have gone for the

01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:59,839
the big brother and gone for the the

01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,880
full 64 cores and 128 threads just

01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:03,920
because

01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:07,280
uh that whooshing sound

01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:09,920
the shorter i that is the better i'm off

01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:12,720
i i remember i uh and this is a long

01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,920
long time ago like 97

01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,000
or eight i brought you an itinium

01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,240
and and wanted you to use that in your

01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,280
home office and we turned that thing on

01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:25,839
and it sounded like an approaching train

01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,039
there was no washing involved i hope

01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:30,480
you're

01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,680
a little quieter oh yeah no i think that

01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,920
was actually not even on

01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,160
titanium i think it was one of the early

01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,359
dual p4 machines

01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,079
uh but yes no i cannot i cannot deal

01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,079
with

01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,119
machines where i can hear the fans

01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:46,079
normally

01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:48,799
uh it turns out now that i've been

01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:51,359
working with my new machine for a while

01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,240
when i can hear that it's working hard

01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,039
that kind of

01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,880
makes me feel good but but normally it

01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:00,160
needs to be completely quiet

01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:03,440
because that just distracts me so

01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,559
so is there a risk that as you use an

01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:08,000
ultra high-end

01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:11,119
64 thread system that you lose touch

01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
to the performance needs of of most of

01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,280
the people

01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,199
because i feel that the gap between

01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,480
the high end of performance that you're

01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:20,640
using right now

01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,640
and the low end of performance that more

01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,480
and more people are using because they

01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,120
are on a mobile device or

01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:29,199
on a fanless system is there a risk that

01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:31,040
you become desensitized to performance

01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:32,960
issues

01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,040
well i don't think it's such a big issue

01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,640
for me for the simple reason that i'm

01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,279
not a developer anymore

01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,000
so i'm not writing the code the reason i

01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,239
need

01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,319
a big and beefy machine is because i'm

01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:46,400
merging code from a lot of people

01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,440
i need to build all of it but if you

01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,000
actually look at what

01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,799
the end developers do and the end users

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,960
do

01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,480
the kernel right now is about 30 million

01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,359
lines of code or something

01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:02,480
and then of that 30 million lines of

01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:05,440
code in most situations you only build

01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,600
maybe a couple of million lines that any

01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:11,440
particular user runs

01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,759
and also if you are an end developer and

01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,080
you're working on a specific issue

01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,520
or a specific feature you wouldn't do

01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,759
the kind of builds i do

01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,359
i build the whole kernel i build every

01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,319
module i try to

01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:28,239
make sure that it all compiles i only do

01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,239
it for one architecture which is kind of

01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:34,239
not what i should be doing but so far

01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:37,600
coverage wise it's been enough

01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:39,839
but i don't think that the fact that i

01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,239
need a fairly beefy machine necessarily

01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:44,239
reflects very much on on other

01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:46,480
developers or on the users

01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:48,400
it is true i mean there's no question

01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:51,679
about the fact that

01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:55,520
a colonel today needs more resources

01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:57,679
than a kernel 20 years ago did

01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,520
my first machine had two megabytes of

01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,960
ram and i would never

01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:07,040
ever run on a two mega i i know it works

01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:11,360
because i've tested it not that long ago

01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:14,400
it runs but there is no way i would use

01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,400
that right i thought

01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,080
because you were making fun of me for my

01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,320
two megabyte system but maybe

01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,400
by then you had already upgraded i was

01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,920
weeks late

01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,320
yes that was weeks later uh but yes so

01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,320
we do need more resources the good news

01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,400
is hardware has gotten better

01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,560
since in the last 30 years even if

01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:37,360
that's slowing down now

01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,920
so so but you even though we never

01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,159
actually

01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,360
talk about my questions upfront so this

01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,239
indeed is a live

01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:47,040
conversation you oddly gave me a

01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:49,040
beautiful layup for my next question

01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,560
because you said you're only compiling

01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,239
for one architecture

01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,880
and with apple's announcement that

01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:57,199
they're switching the max to arm

01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,000
i was wondering if that will change the

01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:00,880
landscape

01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,679
there you know the hierarchy of cpus

01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,840
will that

01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:07,840
actually make arm64 a true first-class

01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,679
platform as more and more people i mean

01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,120
i think it's well known that i actually

01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,600
am usually on a mac

01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,560
a lot more people eventually will have

01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,199
max

01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,120
arm max on the desktop and that's you

01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,000
know fast forward two or three years not

01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,920
tomorrow but

01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,320
in a few years well i've actually been

01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,320
for the last 10 years or so i've been

01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:31,679
complaining about the fact that it's

01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,960
really really hard to find arm hardware

01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,000
that is

01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,440
usable for a developer yeah and

01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,239
uh and i'm i've been waiting for

01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,440
these armed laptops to come out i've

01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:45,360
been

01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:48,159
fairly disappointed in the ones that

01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:50,800
i've seen so far

01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,679
i mean they they exist but they have

01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,320
certainly not

01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:59,280
been real competition to x86 so far

01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,840
i'm actually thinking that the fact that

01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:04,159
apple

01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:07,120
is moving to arm will help

01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:08,239
the arm ecosystem from a development

01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,560
standpoint

01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:12,560
uh the same way that when apple was

01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,600
using power pc

01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,320
uh that was the main way that a lot of

01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,320
people do

01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,520
power pc development i used to have a

01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:23,280
power pc

01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:26,560
for doing linux development which was

01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,719
a power mac uh in fact i still have a

01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,840
power pc but right now

01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:34,159
it is not nearly as convenient

01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,199
or powerful as my main machine so i

01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:38,239
don't use it

01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:42,320
i'm hoping that

01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:45,840
in a few years there will be a

01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,920
powerful arm desktop that can actually

01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,920
be used for development

01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,760
so far you can do development in the

01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,480
cloud uh

01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,080
there is no question that that amazon

01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,560
with the graviton 2

01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,760
has done much better in the arm

01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:04,400
ecosystem in

01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:07,760
in cloud than than we've seen arm before

01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,880
but cloud development is not the kind of

01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,480
development

01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,320
most at least kernel developers want to

01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,920
do you want to have the machine in front

01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,679
of you you want to feel

01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,000
like you're eating your own dog food you

01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:23,040
don't just want to develop forearm

01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,719
you want to actually use arm in your

01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,880
day-to-day

01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:28,480
work on the desktop that's that's at

01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,480
least my feeling and that's

01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,000
i refuse to basically develop for

01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:35,280
anything that i can't use as

01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,199
my desktop or laptop i actually remember

01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,239
a very memorable meeting of

01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:41,440
you andy grove craig barrett paul

01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:44,800
rodolini

01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:47,520
myself pat gelsinger

01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,560
where we talked about exactly that at

01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,080
intel this is

01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,000
oh my gosh 2002 maybe

01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,280
where you talked about exactly that that

01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,880
it is whatever

01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,320
sits on the desk in front of the

01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,640
developer that will win

01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,719
and that intel's titanium would fail and

01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,840
that it would be x86 that would win

01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:08,640
and then obviously you've been right so

01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,239
i guess we should paraphrase president

01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,880
trump and should say

01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:14,480
apple if you're listening get leaness

01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,239
and early

01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,080
arm laptop is that what we should be

01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:20,640
doing here

01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,199
well i'm actually more interested in in

01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,800
their

01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:27,440
eventual arm desktop just because

01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,440
laptops are fine but i only use them

01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,640
during travel and right now i'm clearly

01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,640
not doing any traveling

01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:38,640
a powerful desktop is what i end up

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,040
doing almost all my work on

01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,840
arm clearly has been in the situation

01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,159
where

01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,960
their selling point has not been

01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,080
performance

01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,520
it has been low power and in that sense

01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,800
the laptop space

01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:55,040
uh kind of seems the more natural one

01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,040
but that is also something that i i

01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,320
think is changing

01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,719
that arm at least has the potential to

01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:04,400
grow

01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:06,000
out of the pure low power

01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,760
area and i think that's where apple

01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,880
wants to go to

01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,159
and i'm pretty sure that that the imacs

01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,719
at least i mean i have an imac right

01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:15,440
here

01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,600
i believe the imacs actually are based

01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,840
more or less on laptop boards so it's

01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,760
very similar architecture wise

01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,199
so maybe there will be a at least

01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,760
desktop style maybe not

01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,280
super high performance not at the level

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,320
of your thread ripper but

01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,640
but hopefully a a decent

01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,440
desktop machine will come out relatively

01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,199
soon

01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,000
the other thing as we look at

01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:40,560
architectural changes that we've seen

01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,280
is that switch to more and more

01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:46,400
touch-based user interfaces so

01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,400
i think more and more the the people who

01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,719
want to have a keyboard who want to have

01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,800
an actual laptop

01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,239
are the developers and then maybe some

01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,640
content creators

01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:58,480
but if i look at our hobby app i have

01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,600
the dive pictures behind me

01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:04,560
uh on subsurface we see massive

01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,400
growth of users on android and ios and

01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,360
not so much growth on the

01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:12,000
on the desktop uh what is what are your

01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,360
thoughts about the changes in how people

01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,520
use computers

01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,960
and you know as we finally wrap our

01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,199
minds around touch

01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,880
first generation of voice based

01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:23,120
applications are coming out

01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,360
so do you have any thoughts there in the

01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:29,040
future

01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,679
well on the kernel side we really have

01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,280
not

01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:36,560
had to worry too much about this and

01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:40,159
uh the kernel has very few uis

01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:41,920
we have the drivers for all these uis

01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,120
and we need to have a driver for a

01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:49,840
touchscreen and the

01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:49,840
sun has moved again um

01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,360
as a kernel developer i'm largely

01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,880
insulated from

01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:01,520
these things and except as a pure user

01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,440
of a phone or a tablet

01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,520
so i have not actually been following it

01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:10,400
very much

01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,400
it is it is clearly the case that as

01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,920
as the user interfaces change

01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,800
the things we need to do in the kernel

01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,080
also very much

01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:23,120
change so we have seen

01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:25,520
a lot of new classes of drivers

01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,560
and and it's not just simple things i

01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,520
mean

01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,880
a touch screen is a fairly simple driver

01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,280
in the end

01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,159
but but we're also starting to see all

01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,679
the drivers

01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:40,800
for ai and and and

01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:42,719
completely new things that basically did

01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,600
not exist 10 years ago

01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,159
just because people's expectations of

01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,600
what

01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:50,640
a computer does have changed so in that

01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,640
sense it affects

01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,920
me as a kernel developer but it doesn't

01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,360
affect me as

01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:59,280
in in any other capacity

01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,679
so usually we close our little

01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,320
conversations joking about our next dive

01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,159
trip

01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,800
i think our next dive trip if we want to

01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:08,400
go is gonna be up in washington state in

01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,400
really cold water

01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:14,800
so i may or may not see you there

01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,000
i may or may not see you there but uh

01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,000
thank you so much i

01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,480
i enjoyed chatting with you as always

01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,360
and back to jim

01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,360
thank you thank you

01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:28,640
thank you dirk and lenas uh our next

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,760
speaker

01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,400
is heather miller she is an assistant

01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,960
professor

01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,080
at the carnegie mellon university school

01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,040
of computer science

01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,640
institute for software research uh and

01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:44,000
founded the scala center in

01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:46,560
2016. uh today she is going to

01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,040
share a data-driven portrait of new

01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,320
transit

01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:53,120
open source and how we build software

01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,710
i am very excited to welcome heather

01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,240
miller

01:18:54,710 --> 01:19:00,239
[Applause]

01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:04,400
[Music]

01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:07,440
hello um hello from exotic pittsburgh

01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:10,960
pennsylvania very exciting place

01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:13,040
um yeah thanks for the intro jim so um

01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,320
as uh whoops i think everybody can see

01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,920
my slides right

01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:20,960
um yeah cool

01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,440
um so as jim said um i'm going to give

01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,920
you

01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:26,159
um a number of data points today that

01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,120
i've been collecting over the years um

01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,520
just about open source um in general

01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,560
most

01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:35,440
often sort of more geared towards

01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,880
how people kind of come together there's

01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,560
a lot of action there's a lot of actual

01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,920
research about this stuff

01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:45,120
that is maybe just not so prevalent in

01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:48,719
sort of open source um like industry

01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:50,080
kind of channels or events and things

01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:51,840
like that so i figured

01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,760
um i can give you kind of a tour of some

01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,159
of the things that are both

01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,040
data from from industrial firms and then

01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,360
data from

01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,960
a bunch of research papers uh that point

01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,080
to kind of interesting trends

01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:07,520
and um as jim mentioned um

01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:09,360
i am i'm now at the at carnegie mellon

01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,800
university i'm an assistant professor of

01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:14,480
computer science here

01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:17,280
um prior to cmu i was

01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,000
at epfl um in switzerland where i did my

01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,239
phd

01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
um on the scott like in you know on the

01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:25,120
scholar programming language ultimately

01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,000
i uh then founded the scala center

01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:29,440
upon graduating and sort of started that

01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,199
and sort of ran it for the f

01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,880
for a few years as the executive

01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:36,639
director of the scala center

01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:39,760
um so you know i i

01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:42,239
accidentally fell into a director

01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,840
sort of manager role when i was you know

01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:46,000
at the scala center

01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,040
but you know my real my real day-to-day

01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
is is research

01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:51,520
and uh in particular um i do research on

01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,520
distributed programming

01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,440
um or sort of models for distributed

01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,360
programming and concurrency

01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,120
um and i've been working on these things

01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,880
in scala for a number of years

01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,320
um and you know lately we've been

01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,760
getting into sort of trying to ease

01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,199
reasoning about building

01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,600
microservice based applications and

01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:09,360
things like that um so

01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,840
you know those are so that's what i

01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,360
actually work on day to day um

01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,679
and you know we're working on a whole

01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,480
bunch of like ultra technical things

01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:20,000
like um redefining the foundation of

01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,159
these replicated data structures known

01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,840
as crdts we just published a paper

01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:25,520
in the international conference of

01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,679
functional programming this year on that

01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,360
um and then kind of reimagining what

01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,719
fault injection might look like as sort

01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,480
of like a testing thing

01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,159
as a testing framework and we do all

01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:37,120
kinds of stuff like this so

01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,520
um the the data and the info that i have

01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,120
um

01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,040
on on open source stuff if that's my day

01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,080
to day um the data that i have about

01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,199
open source is sort of

01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,880
things that i've been collecting over

01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,880
the years especially when i was this

01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:50,480
this director of the skala center

01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:53,840
um so um just to

01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:56,639
just to kind of frame uh you know

01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:58,000
where i'm starting with this um as it

01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,520
sounds like i'm a person who's just kind

01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,360
of been hacking around on you know race

01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,600
conditions and weird concurrency bugs

01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,120
uh so you might think that you know i

01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,639
prefer to live in those problems you

01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,480
know what i do i really prefer to live

01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,120
in those problems but then i became the

01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:13,199
the leader of an open source foundation

01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:15,040
and i found this tweet a few years later

01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,880
um which i find amazing so the two

01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:20,880
hardest problems in computer science

01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:22,880
are one people that i agree with

01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,639
two convincing computer scientists that

01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,920
the hardest problem in computer science

01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,840
is people

01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:33,360
and three one off by one errors

01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,280
so um i still think that this is true um

01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,880
and since becoming the the director of

01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:39,280
this thing called the scala center

01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,400
um i went from you know doing

01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:42,719
concurrency stuff

01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:44,239
and distributed programming and like you

01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,360
know dealing with serialization code and

01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:47,360
things like that

01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,560
to focusing 200 percent suddenly on

01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,280
what's happening in the open source

01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,960
scala

01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,320
uh community and you know i had been a

01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,760
part of it for several years while doing

01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,199
my phd but you know it was never my

01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,800
responsibility to try and make anything

01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:58,320
better until all of a sudden

01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,440
after i finished my phd we're like okay

01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,360
we're gonna do this we're gonna make an

01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:04,159
open source foundation for scala

01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,880
um and our goal was not just to uh you

01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:06,159
know

01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,320
benefit people who are paying into the

01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:09,600
scala center but it was also uh just

01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,639
anybody who had an internet connection

01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,000
they should have a good developer

01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,560
experience that should be for free for

01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,199
them

01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,320
and sort of when i when i had to go

01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,719
through this shift

01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,800
um you know i quickly observed a lot of

01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,679
problems uh you know

01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,880
in the scala community um and i then

01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:27,040
noticed that some of these things

01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,239
are are problems for other communities

01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,159
and as well

01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:31,760
um and the numbers that i'm collecting

01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,800
for you today are not scala specific

01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,520
they're

01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,880
generally open source specific and then

01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,800
when it comes to sort of industrial

01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,159
statistics and educational statistics i

01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,560
have to focus on the us

01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:44,159
um mostly because that's where i am and

01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,840
also the sort of

01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,600
you know a very large developer

01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,960
community is within the us but some of

01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,480
these trends hold true especially in

01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:54,400
western europe

01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:56,080
um so whoops uh and so yeah like i said

01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,600
i started collecting uh data on some of

01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,000
these fast-changing trends

01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,960
um and things that i want to bring to

01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,400
your attention today so we're going to

01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,440
touch on three topics

01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,719
um two are maybe something that you

01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,639
hadn't considered

01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,080
one is maybe adding more data to what

01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,760
you already know so

01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,840
um the one that you already know is that

01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,840
open source is becoming just you know

01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,600
the foundation of everything nowadays

01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,280
nobody really reaches for proprietary

01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,280
software very much anymore and i i will

01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,920
show you a bunch of numbers that back

01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,760
this up

01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,760
the other two things that i think that

01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,000
maybe people don't know or aren't

01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,120
as readily aware of is that the way that

01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,120
we build software

01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,719
and what we think a software engineer is

01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,520
is changing really fast

01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,400
and it's i so uh dirk and linus we're

01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,719
talking about

01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,159
you know the the older developers you

01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,440
know the 50-somethings i'm a

01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:44,719
30-something

01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:46,560
i feel old uh you know you know

01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,000
just looking at the people coming in and

01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,520
seeing that they have a much different

01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,840
experience than i had

01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,960
um and what i think a software engineer

01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,040
is is very different

01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,560
than what they are introduced to and i

01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,080
just want to

01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,080
however many years of experience you

01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,040
have uh as a professional software

01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,520
developer

01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,560
um you know if you've had more than two

01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,679
or three

01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,920
you're actually uh you know becoming a

01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,199
the minority quickly is my is sort of my

01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,960
my overarching point we'll see that in

01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:16,000
some numbers in a moment

01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,360
um and you know this kind of hooks up

01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,719
together with how we build software how

01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:22,000
that's all changing

01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,880
um so first uh people the way that

01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,800
people are getting into

01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,040
technical careers or sort of software

01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,520
development careers or programming roles

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,800
um is is changing very quick we all know

01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,239
especially if we're just looking at the

01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,360
us it's really hard to hire

01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:36,239
in software engineering um obviously we

01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,360
don't you know

01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,639
we're always trying to find the best

01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,480
software developers but you know there's

01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,000
not even enough software developers for

01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,760
for the jobs that we need to fill in the

01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,920
first place um so

01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,760
actually i'm going to jump quickly to to

01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:50,800
this this data point here

01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,480
so this is actually um two gr

01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,400
data from two different sources that i

01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:58,080
superimposed on the same graph

01:25:54,400 --> 01:26:00,960
so the blue bars are the number of

01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,600
bachelor's degrees in technical sort of

01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,639
our

01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:06,560
cs or it related uh fields

01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,320
given by the us and these are statistics

01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,920
from the department uh there's a

01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:11,600
bureau of educational statistics and

01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,880
they publish these things there's a lag

01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,080
of some years

01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,159
but they publish these things every

01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:18,239
couple of years um and

01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:19,199
they you know in the last the last

01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,679
numbers that i have

01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:23,600
are from the 2015 school year uh and

01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:26,239
that year there was about 60 000

01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,760
uh cs or it related degrees granted by

01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:30,719
american universities

01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,639
um and from uh from that year onward

01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,840
they projected about a 7.4 percent

01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,760
growth so you could sort of

01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,880
project forward into the future and see

01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,960
sort of how many

01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,360
uh how many degrees are expected to be

01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,840
conferred by 2026 and you can see by

01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:46,320
2026 we're getting up to 150k

01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,920
um but meanwhile the the department of

01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,000
labor statistics um

01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,480
is publishing numbers that were saying

01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,440
in 2017

01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:57,920
um there were over 500 000 computing

01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,960
related jobs open in the us that were

01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,960
were not filled so um companies were

01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:06,080
struggling to hire people in

01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,280
500 000 positions um and what gets worse

01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,159
is that they project that this number is

01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,560
going to get a lot

01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:12,000
higher in in future years um so

01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,800
everybody can be like oh well what about

01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,320
uh you know

01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,760
tech boot camps if you don't have a

01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,560
bachelor's degree in computer science it

01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,360
doesn't mean that you can't be a

01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,199
programmer

01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,560
it's true and i am in full support of

01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,840
tech bootcamps i'm a professor and i

01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,760
probably shouldn't be right

01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,920
but i i think that that's you know a

01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,000
great way to to start to solve this this

01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,920
the shortage that we have of developers

01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,440
um but even if you add that number those

01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,880
numbers are growing at around

01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,239
the slot the number isn't on the slide

01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,960
it should be on the slides that are

01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:36,639
saved

01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,239
um you can look up these slides they're

01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:40,159
they're saved online in my

01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:41,199
uh my schedule page you can download

01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,719
them look at them yourself you should

01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,560
see the number on that on that

01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:45,920
that version of the slides but the

01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,920
number is about 14

01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,040
i believe uh you know rate of increase

01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,800
per year so

01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,080
um and we're starting to get good

01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,360
numbers about how many people are

01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,480
graduating from these these coding

01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,159
bootcamp programs

01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:58,239
um and even then you know we're getting

01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:00,719
up to just under 200k

01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:02,719
uh new developers or people that could

01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:06,159
be potentially considered entry level

01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:09,520
um in in 2026 let's just say

01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:10,800
um but the uh bureau of uh

01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,600
or the department of labor and

01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:17,040
statistics um project that by

01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:19,840
2026 that that need is going to increase

01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,679
to uh about 3.5 million so there's going

01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,800
to be 3.5 million openings

01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:26,239
and this actually um so it's you know

01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,280
it's not completely fair to overlay

01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:30,320
these numbers on top of

01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:32,719
one another because especially that that

01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:34,159
huge uh that huge number there that the

01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:34,960
bureau or the department of labor and

01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:37,679
statistics

01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,320
they actually include um people coming

01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:41,760
in

01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,000
and uh you know people uh retiring in in

01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,120
these

01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,800
numbers so this is just kind of guessing

01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:50,320
what the economy would look like

01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:52,239
so this is also numbers pre coronavirus

01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:53,199
pandemic so perhaps the economy is not

01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:56,480
going to be as

01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:57,679
brilliantly uh you know successful or

01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,199
whatever based on the

01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:01,120
the sort of performance of the economy

01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,080
in the last several months but still the

01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,120
point is that there are

01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:06,880
a large number of of projected openings

01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:08,320
uh and i can't imagine that completely

01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,560
going away so

01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,360
um you know if there if this trend

01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,760
continues

01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,280
uh it's obvious that there's no way that

01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,440
coding boot camps and u.s

01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,560
uh bachelor programs combined can can

01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,600
fill these openings

01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:23,120
um the the bureau says that about 19 of

01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,000
those jobs could probably be

01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,719
filled by uh computing degree uh

01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,080
bachelor

01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:31,040
recipients that's it so um clearly this

01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,719
mean oh

01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:34,239
uh and actually i i want to make one

01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,840
more point before i

01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:38,000
uh a transition out of this is it's that

01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,679
um

01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,480
if you so this is these are statistics

01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:47,840
from the stack overflow developer survey

01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,719
these are worldwide um but you know

01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,159
what's interesting

01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:53,520
is that um you know this this there is

01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:56,719
this concentrating

01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,199
um over the years of people towards the

01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,800
top

01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:01,120
in this in these graphs so what they

01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,159
show is the number of years that people

01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,400
who are

01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:05,600
filling out the survey uh they say hey

01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,639
that they are professional software

01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,560
developers and they say

01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:10,080
uh you know how many years they've been

01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:13,280
professionally programming

01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:15,199
um and you know the there's just a

01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,239
larger number of people concentrating

01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:18,080
towards the top

01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,760
which means that people have less than

01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,960
one year of experience or one or two

01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,000
years of experience

01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,960
most of them less than five so um the

01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,040
point really here

01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,239
is that there is a lot of people coming

01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,080
in and maybe

01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:32,000
you know i like i said i'm 30 something

01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,719
i don't see i mean i'm a professor i

01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,360
teach them

01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:37,440
but uh you know in any other sort of

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:40,800
walk of software engineering i i don't

01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,480
i don't assume uh that there are people

01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,159
extremely different and with a lot less

01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:46,239
experience than me coming in

01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:47,520
at a rate that they are uh and i think

01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,639
that this is something that more people

01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:51,440
need to consider

01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:53,040
um so the tl dr here is basically we

01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:56,880
have a lot of newcomers and they're

01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:59,120
they're arriving quickly um and so

01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,320
my point is that uh you know there are

01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,520
there are a lot of

01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:04,960
uh new developers coming in the the this

01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,239
this tidal wave of new developers

01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,880
entering our profession is not going to

01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:09,679
slow down

01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,280
it's just going to pick up speed um and

01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,719
you know the overall like years of

01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,920
experience of practicing software

01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:14,560
engineers professional software

01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,960
engineers

01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,679
that is going down over time uh because

01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,480
there are so many

01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:20,960
new people coming in um and there are a

01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,080
lot of

01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:26,400
um you know reasons

01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,239
uh obviously um computer science is

01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,280
becoming a very cool profession and

01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:32,239
there are a lot of initiatives to

01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,000
promote uh people majoring this in col

01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:36,000
in college but then also people would

01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,760
like to perhaps change

01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,440
career trajectories and get into

01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,560
computer science or programming

01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:44,719
um and um one thing that has sort of

01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,600
enabled some of this growth um as

01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:47,920
attributed to

01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,120
um a man named caleb fristo he's a

01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,440
founder of a

01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:53,360
coding boot camp in tennessee this this

01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:55,280
comes from the communications of the acm

01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,960
it's an article in 2019 it's in the in

01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,159
the slides so you can go look up this

01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,400
article if you'd like to read more about

01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,760
it

01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,440
all my references are at the bottom of

01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,239
the slides um

01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,880
he says that uh you know new frameworks

01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:08,159
are lowering the barrier to entry

01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,280
and that's a far cry from the days when

01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,639
you have to learn the syntax of several

01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,679
different programming languages to build

01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,600
useful software

01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:15,520
so rather than typing in these seven

01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,719
lines of code to get a menu to pop down

01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,239
you just download the framework from a

01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,280
code base that allows you to do that in

01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,719
a simpler way

01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:22,239
he says so frameworks are taking the

01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:22,960
hard work that developers used to pride

01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,960
themselves on

01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,480
out of the equation so ultimately you

01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,280
know the sort of takeaway here is that

01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,120
it's easier to

01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,320
teach people that are beginners because

01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,800
we have these frameworks

01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:34,800
that can you know do things in in sort

01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,679
of fewer lines of code and fewer sort of

01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,080
like like cognitive cycles uh if you

01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,840
will

01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:44,159
and you know that this is helping um

01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,920
and uh you know another issue that you

01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:46,880
know i i would i would be remiss not to

01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,560
bring up is that

01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,920
we have also an issue with existing

01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,639
developers burning out

01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,840
so um what is happening in the face of

01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,639
this this problem where a lot of

01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,960
companies can't

01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:58,159
um fill all the positions that they have

01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,880
employers are trying to shuffle

01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,320
additional

01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,159
duties on to the employees that they

01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:04,000
currently have um and so there's a lot

01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,440
of work looking at burnout um in

01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,360
software engineering professions based

01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:10,560
on sort of this having to happen

01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:11,120
um and you know uh if you if you ask

01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,199
people

01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:15,120
uh related you know in in the world of

01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:19,920
hiring and tech positions

01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:21,679
uh people uh people people at indeed.com

01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:23,199
who have done a survey on this they say

01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,320
that this this accelerates staff

01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,679
turnover the fact that more

01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,639
responsibilities are being put onto

01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:28,560
people so

01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:30,239
um also kind of a worthwhile thing to

01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,360
hold on to here

01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:35,679
um i'm i'm going to make a quick point

01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,960
um and plug some research on diversity

01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,920
so obviously increased diversity would

01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,440
help and also

01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,520
immigration if the us got better at

01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:43,840
immigration uh that would be great

01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,560
um and you know making it easier to do

01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,719
remote work

01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,679
uh these are ways to sort of start to

01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,400
fill uh

01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:52,320
this need uh where you know maybe we're

01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:57,199
having trouble filling it obviously

01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:59,120
um and i just want to to mention um

01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:00,159
i'm going to just mention some research

01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,520
that i would encourage you if you're

01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:03,040
interested in any of this

01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,560
uh to have a quick look at when you have

01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,159
some time

01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,080
basically there there is research that

01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:10,639
says um and this is from a colleague of

01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,560
mine at cmu's name is bogdan vasilescu

01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:14,239
um that you know if you look at the

01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,679
productivity of software

01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:17,440
engineering teams and this is looking at

01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:19,920
teams on github over a long period of

01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:21,679
time if you hold other confidence fixed

01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,040
teams that are more diverse with respect

01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:26,560
to both gender

01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:29,120
and tenure exp tend to experience

01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,560
or sorry tend to write code a lot faster

01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,520
than teams that are less diverse in

01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:35,600
these ways

01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:37,920
and so so uh you know what that means

01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,880
actually you know this is another point

01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,320
i'm just going to show you it's in the

01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,920
paper you should look at this

01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:46,239
um there's another paper about how

01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,360
how particularly women lose engagement

01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:50,560
faster and

01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:53,679
you know this idea of having uh this uh

01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,119
you know mixed um

01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,119
sort of diversity in terms of gender and

01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:59,600
diversity in terms of experience

01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:00,239
it tends to lead to people building

01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,880
develop

01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:04,560
building software better software faster

01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,040
and ultimately this is basically

01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,880
you know there being diversity people

01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,560
being sensitive to one another and

01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,800
there are being people with different

01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,000
skill sets from very experienced to very

01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,520
inexperienced on the same

01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,119
team so people end up kind of feeling

01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,480
more comfortable sharing

01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:20,159
you know what they do when they do not

01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,639
know people are more safe to just kind

01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,639
of

01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,920
learn from one another and that's kind

01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,480
of you know a

01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,600
very unscientific interpretation of all

01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:30,719
of this

01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,199
um but okay let's get back to the rest

01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,600
of the

01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:34,400
the the points that i wanted to make so

01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,679
i mentioned that

01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,520
that the way that we built software is

01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,199
changing um and

01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,639
i think that a lot of people have so i'm

01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:43,840
not going to spend a lot of time

01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:45,679
on on these open source um

01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,960
surveys by various companies because i

01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,400
think a lot of people know these already

01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,280
but i'm just going to quickly summarize

01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,760
them so

01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,119
um blacked up black duck has been doing

01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,239
this future of open source survey their

01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:56,880
now synopsis

01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:59,520
um and you know over the years you know

01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:02,560
from 2010 to 2015 in particular

01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:04,239
um they noted that out of around 1200

01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,800
companies that they've been surveying

01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:08,639
um the the increase in the reliance on

01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,199
open source software has doubled

01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,960
and that's of as of 2015. obviously that

01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:16,159
number keeps on increasing right

01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:18,480
um so in 2015 um

01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:19,679
companies only would consider 66 or two

01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,600
thirds of companies would consider

01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,199
uh open source options before

01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,760
proprietary alternatives and that was

01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,840
that was

01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,119
already a few years ago right so by then

01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,239
open source is becoming the default

01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:29,840
choice people would need to consider

01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:33,520
proprietary choices

01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,679
um by 2017 um

01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,440
in the uh in these these uh black duck

01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:39,440
slash synopsis surveys

01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:41,360
companies said that they increased their

01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,760
open source usage and the main reason

01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,800
that they

01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,560
they claimed for that was that

01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,080
it was lower costs and there was no

01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:52,960
vendor locked in

01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:55,360
um and by 2018 um so this is now

01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,040
uh you know scanning dependencies of

01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,719
commercial code bases

01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,560
open source components were found so out

01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:03,040
of 1100 code bases scanned

01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,920
open source components um were found in

01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,600
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,840
of applications that were scanned and

01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,600
there was an average of 257

01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,920
open source components per application

01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,600
so 96 of companies were using open

01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,679
source in 2018

01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,960
um and you know the average number of

01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:19,840
open source components that each company

01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:21,679
was using was a whopping 257 components

01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,679
um in 2017

01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:25,199
the the percentage of a code of these

01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,159
company code bases that were considered

01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:31,199
open source

01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:33,199
uh components was 36 by 2018 that number

01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:36,320
had increased to 57 percent

01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:39,920
okay so it's it's it's a it's shocking

01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:41,520
uh change um there's a company called

01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,800
uh hide lift that maybe many of you have

01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,400
heard of they've they've observed

01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,600
similar things and that is that

01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:50,639
um open source uh uh applications

01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:53,280
are 70 i'm sorry um

01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,840
and most applications that they are

01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,159
scanning

01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,000
and analyzing which are you know closed

01:37:56,159 --> 01:38:00,719
source or end user applications

01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,600
70 of them are composed of open source

01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:03,840
components

01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,040
20 percent is custom application code or

01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,119
business logic and 10

01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,719
is sort of infrastructure so linux or

01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:10,880
kubernetes so basically

01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:12,239
20 of what you know your engineers at

01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:14,239
your company are writing

01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:15,600
uh you're only writing 20 of the

01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:18,480
application which is

01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:20,000
amazing right that that we're writing

01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,600
not all of it by ourselves anymore

01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,800
finally reuse works

01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:25,199
um so yes take a second to internalize

01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,840
that

01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:29,280
um in 2018 70 percent of code bases were

01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,320
open source components

01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:34,080
um according to tidelift and in 2018

01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,600
57 of codebases were open source

01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,760
components so that's still a majority

01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:41,280
it's amazing

01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:43,520
um so i'm going to

01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,880
jump over this point but i love these

01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:47,119
quotes if you're interested so mike

01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,800
krieger who is a co-founder of instagram

01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:51,840
basically argued for reusing

01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:55,199
over building yourself um and

01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,880
um you know at the same time so like yes

01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:58,400
let's do that let's build our startups

01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,960
on this let's become unicorns

01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,639
um but according to tidelift2 continues

01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,000
to do a number of these surveys amongst

01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,000
open source developers they say that

01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,880
around 62 percent of

01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,400
respondents uh you know they have to

01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,679
financially support themselves or do all

01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,880
this on the work all this work on the

01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:14,080
weekends or that there's not a company

01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:17,840
backing them so that's

01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:21,600
incredible that's a huge number um

01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:23,119
so um i'm going to

01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,320
mention a few things that are a little

01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:24,800
terrifying that we might already know

01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,920
about

01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:30,000
so we know about um partly

01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:31,360
and sort of the tldr about things like

01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,960
heartbleed is that you know you have two

01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:35,600
thirds of the internet using

01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,360
openssl and then um you've got everybody

01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,920
jumping on this bandwagon and nobody

01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:41,119
realizes that openssl at the time before

01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,520
a bunch of companies started

01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:45,280
investing money in it um openssl wasn't

01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,199
even able to support a single person's

01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,960
uh work even though two-thirds of the

01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:50,800
internet was using it so

01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,119
those are things that hopefully the

01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,880
linux foundation is here to fix

01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:56,639
um then we have things like the truck

01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,840
factor there's um researchers actually

01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:00,000
trying to measure things like the truck

01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,840
factor so the truck factor is the

01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,360
minimal number of developers that have

01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,080
to be hit by a truck

01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,480
uh or quit or be otherwise incapacitated

01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,800
or

01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:10,320
sorry the otherwise you know disappear

01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,440
from a project for the project to become

01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,840
incapacitated

01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,560
um so linux is awesome linux is a super

01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,159
high

01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,360
uh truck factor but there's a lot of

01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:19,040
other things that are pretty widely used

01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:21,840
that have very low truck factors

01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,960
things like uh neti and closure and

01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,239
cassandra

01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,600
a lot of people use these things and

01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:27,440
they don't realize the truck factor is

01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:29,040
rather low

01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:31,119
um and if i've learned anything from the

01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:32,080
scala community it is that ecosystem in

01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:34,719
community is

01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,960
really everything um because we have had

01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:37,679
a lot of issues with community in our in

01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,040
our uh

01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:43,040
you know in the scholar ecosystem um

01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,400
and just to you know throw another paper

01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,840
in here in case you're interested in

01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,560
reading about it this is how programming

01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,000
line this is

01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:50,000
some numbers about programming language

01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,760
adoption um

01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,280
really the thing that i'd like to point

01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,000
out here is that you look at the top of

01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,800
this graph

01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,080
uh so this is there they did basically

01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,920
these researchers

01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:01,040
did a lot of surveys they analyzed a lot

01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,400
of code bases and they found from

01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,440
talking to developers and we're talking

01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,040
thousands and thousands of builders

01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:06,880
think up to 13 000 developers

01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:09,040
that the main things that were important

01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,320
uh to developers when deciding whether

01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,119
to adopt something a particular

01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,159
programming language

01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:14,000
it was that there were open source

01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:15,360
libraries there they could extend

01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,800
existing code and that you know there

01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,239
was some familiarity with it so these

01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,080
are all extrinsic factors and not

01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,520
like intrinsic to the the language not

01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,159
like oh this has type or it doesn't have

01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,199
types

01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,400
really what was more important was

01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,760
actually the open source libraries the

01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:29,040
open source communities

01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:31,679
um and tied lift whoops uh tide lift

01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:33,600
oops the the the thing is over the text

01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,920
but tide lift has found the same thing

01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,360
um ultimately what they found was that

01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,080
professional users people who want to

01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,080
adopt

01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:41,280
um open source libraries they want an

01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,159
active community and so the most

01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,080
important thing

01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:45,760
according to tide lift was that

01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,119
software's reliable and well maintained

01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,080
that has an active community supporting

01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:50,480
and using it

01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,199
um and that software maintainers provide

01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,880
timely

01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:54,480
bug fixes they have the the resources

01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:57,520
and abilities to do that

01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,920
um so oh my god i gave you too many

01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,639
things and

01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,920
you're probably all dying the main sort

01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:03,600
of point here is that

01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,440
um there's research that points to the

01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,280
fact that community and ecosystem

01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,719
are among the most important factors to

01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,920
an open source project

01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:14,400
uh to an open source project success

01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:16,560
and that's it so um i just want to

01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:18,239
provide a couple of sentences of summary

01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,960
and then i will let you all escape

01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:22,159
um basically the the sort of takeaways

01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,560
from this talk are

01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:25,520
that um the way that we build software

01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,440
is becoming

01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:30,080
is different than it was when you know

01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:33,360
linus decided that linux was a good idea

01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:34,639
right um people are reusing uh

01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,400
or just building on top of frameworks

01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:37,840
way more than they ever were so it's

01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,719
becoming easier to teach newcomers

01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,159
things so

01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,520
um you know this whole point of

01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,639
developers using used to pride

01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,320
themselves on very

01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,920
very uh efficient ways to implement

01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:47,840
something now we just you know tell

01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,239
newcomer grab that thing off of a

01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,440
off of a shelf um and reuse that thing

01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:54,560
off of the shelf right

01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:55,920
um that was how that's how it's going um

01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,520
we know that there are sustainability

01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,800
issues in open source things like the

01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,679
linux foundation are hopefully helping

01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,880
that but

01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:05,040
still sustainability issues uh remain

01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,880
um and then finally our idea of software

01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:09,119
engineers is also changing so

01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,800
we have this huge influx of newcomers

01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:11,840
and we need those newcomers to fill some

01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,119
of the holes that we

01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,119
inevitably are going to have in the

01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:16,320
future so this means you know like

01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:18,560
looking at ourselves and trying to

01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,080
develop cultures of sort of mentorship

01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,080
and looking at some of the scientific

01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,119
research you know if you have diverse

01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:26,000
teams

01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:26,960
and you have a diversity and experience

01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,560
you can actually

01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:29,679
expect that they will develop code

01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,480
faster than teams that are more

01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:33,360
homogeneous

01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:34,960
according to the research okay um and

01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,760
i'm really happy to talk about any more

01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,800
of these things

01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:41,840
um i will be in the slack channel and

01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:44,080
um i can i think end it here

01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,360
um i'm not sure if jim or somebody's

01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,719
gonna come back on but i will go to

01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,199
slack and i'm happy to answer questions

01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:49,040
to talk

01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:53,199
uh more there and also the slides are

01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:55,440
posted on the schedule page

01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:57,040
all right thank you uh heather that that

01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:59,360
was really good and to

01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:00,159
directly answer your question the lynx

01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,560
foundation

01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:04,000
definitely wants to help with uh

01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,880
projects openssl

01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,480
is one that we have written grants to uh

01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,920
we're also working through our core

01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:12,560
infrastructure initiative

01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:13,679
uh and harvard university's lab for

01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:17,600
innovation science

01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:21,119
to uh go do research on the intersection

01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:24,239
of projects that are critical to the

01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:27,600
collective uh society and internet

01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:29,920
and really need help and sustainability

01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,679
we also have fundraising programs

01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:34,400
through our community bridge platform to

01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:37,199
help raise funds for maintainers who

01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:39,440
maintain these critical projects free

01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:42,480
security tools for those folks

01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:44,719
and sneak preview we will be announcing

01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:48,560
a new initiative to help with the very

01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:49,040
issue that uh you uh talked about i i

01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,000
also

01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:53,840
uh love your point on uh the need for

01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,400
more diversity in our communities

01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,600
