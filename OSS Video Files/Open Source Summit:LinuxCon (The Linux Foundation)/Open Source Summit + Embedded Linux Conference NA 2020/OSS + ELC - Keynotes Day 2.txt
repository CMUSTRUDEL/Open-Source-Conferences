00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,359
good morning everyone

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,000
and welcome back to open source summit

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,400
uh north america we are very happy to

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,359
have

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,080
everyone here for our virtual conference

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
we

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,840
wish we could have seen you live but uh

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,000
unfortunately these are these are tough

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,880
times

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
this morning we have an amazing group of

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
speakers

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,440
and a few special announcements in

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,239
particular i want to start with

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
a announcement from our open power

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,440
foundation

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,719
today the open power foundation is

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,079
announcing that

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,800
ibm's a2i power processor core design

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,160
and associated fpga environment is being

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,199
contributed to the

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,399
open source community it's available

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,960
right now on github this is an in-order

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,559
multi-threaded 64-bit power iso core

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,040
that was developed as a

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,680
processor for customization and embedded

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,240
use on

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,880
system on a chip devices it was designed

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,560
to provide

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
high streaming throughput while

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
balancing performance and power

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,960
you may be familiar with some of its

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,000
work the a2i was used as the general

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,360
purpose processor

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,479
in ibm's blue jean q family of systems

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,479
which helped advance

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,600
scientific discovery over the last

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,840
decade

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
mandy frumanik and james kalina

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,479
president and executive director

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,200
of open power foundation are leading a

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,159
session at

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,799

updates track definitely tune in and

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,799
learn more about the a2i

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,680
power processor contribution

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
our first speaker this morning is also

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
from

global business line executive for ibm

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
software support business are joining us

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,880
to talk about

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,640
trusted ai our world has changed

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
environmental and social factors are

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
making uh taking ai models into new

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
territory

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
they will discuss how we can come

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
together promote

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,400
ethical ai use and trust as models to

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,720
drive our world forward

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,530
please welcome camilla sharp and todd

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,080

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,080
[Applause]

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,440
hi i'm todd moore ibm vice president for

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,640
open technology

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,560
today i want to talk to you about

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,599
something that's near and dear to me a

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
topic that i

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,040
talked about before actually at one of

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,680
the

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,239
linux foundation open source events and

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,239
that's

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,000
trusted ai responsible ai

00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:00,080
we're in a world today that is

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,080
caught in a pandemic we have a global

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
health crisis that depends on data

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
and how we collect that data and how we

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,760
make effective use of it

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,159
can save lives at the same time

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,800
we're in the midst of a global movement

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,120
around

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,239
race and equality and these things

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
intersect

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,840
and they intersect with how we handle ai

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
our models our data and and where we go

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,159
from here

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,799
at ibm's core um our values

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,560
are those of equal rights and these are

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,480
long-standing policies that go back to

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
1953 and thomas j

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,159
watson where he put in place policy

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,920
letter number four

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,640
that stated that ibm would be an equal

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,760
opportunity

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,440
employer and that we would not have bias

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,000
as a result of race color or religion

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,280
now arvind kushner has also taken up

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,360
this task

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,840
arvin has taken the ibm company

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
out of facial recognition so here's one

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
avenue

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,879
that will no longer be available

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,760
for uses that could create bias in our

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
society

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,040
and he's opened us up to a public

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,280
dialogue

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,159
as to whether this technology makes

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,360
sense

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,519
and how our society should handle it but

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,160
trust and transparency and ai goes

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,759
beyond just facial recognition

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,400
as the data that we collect gets used

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,360
privacy issues will certainly uh be at

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
play

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
ethics of how that data is used how it's

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
transformed

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,479
how we as a society respond

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,680
all need to be sorted out and ibm has

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,720
been providing tools

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,960
we've open source a number of projects

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,639
we have a robustness toolkit these are

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,720
all python libraries

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,440
we have a fairness toolkit that looks

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,440
for biases within models and data

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,440
we have an explainability toolkit that

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,000
allows you to

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
very quickly look at the black box that

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
is potentially your ai model

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,520
and and turn it into something that you

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,039
can recognize how it's behaving

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,840
these are essential things that will

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,919
help us go and take bias out of it

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,160
at the same time we're also working now

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,440
on what we call ai

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
fact sheets and here will essentially be

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,880
how we

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
hold models accountable uh think about

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
it

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,960
in terms of like the labeling that you

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
have on on

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,639
food products right it took a long time

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,320
to develop but once they did you get

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,840
quite a bit of information out of it as

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,000
to what's actually in

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,440
that can of soup that you have and

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
that's what you'll find as we go and

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,600
develop this project

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,880
as well too now these projects have have

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,000
progressed

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,440
and what we find is that the

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,759
linux foundation ai organization where

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,880
we want to see these in open governance

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,039
has a tac and they voted positively to

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,479
now incubate these projects you'll see

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,680
all three of the ones that have been out

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,199
and open sourced

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,720
available through the lfai organization

00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
so we thank them very much for doing

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,039
this

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
we think it's a great place for others

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,280
to come join in

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
and openly shape and drive this work

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,840
forward we think it's important to

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,759
society

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,800
the group already has quite a few really

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,960
important companies who are involved and

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
universities as well too there's a

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
trusted ai committee

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
that we would hope that any of you who

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
can

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,039
uh would come and join because they've

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,600
been developing the principles

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,680
by which we will take advantage of and

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,000
and use the models and the data that

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,720
are coming out of the ai technologies

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
involved

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,479
so they have seven workers or seven

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,919
principles

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,600
that have come from the work group

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,039
equitability

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,560
reproducibility transparency governance

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,960
privacy security accountability

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,440
these are the seven principles that they

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,919
are working on right now as we speak

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,440
so please come and join that now um

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,000
since the last time we were out there

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,199
and and talked about this uh i i just

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
mentioned obviously a

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,039
fact sheets have come into play and

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,240
we're starting to open source those

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,960
but the aif 360 group has uh

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
worked with psychic learn and r studio

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,120
and now have

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,240
uh made themselves available the kufo

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
pipelines for ml ops uh are out there

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
now

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,880
and we can do fairness and adversarial

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,599
detection on those pipelines and uh

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,560
ml ops uh has taken a step into apache

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,720
nifi

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
and we now have a processor available as

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
well so all the projects are also making

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,080
great progress

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
and thank you for the folks who have

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
been contributing

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,960
again i think this is a really important

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,800
thing for our world okay let's switch

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,000
gears to something for just a moment

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,800
uh i have with me mariana villa

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,800
who represents a group in colombia the

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
largest community of women in tech in

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
colombia

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,039
and and she's here with me because ibm's

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,599
each quarter get a chance to

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,360
vote for the organizations that they

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,000
feel are really deserving of community

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
grants

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,919
and we started this back last year where

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,000
we've been giving out essentially fifty

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,479
thousand dollars worth of community

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,199
grants

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
to really deserving folks out there and

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
it's twenty five thousand cash twenty

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
five

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,319
000 in cloud credits and it allows them

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,440
the freedom to

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,080
to do as as they would like as well as

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,800
to

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,360
be supportive of of their organizations

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
with

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,639
uh cloud uh resources so that they can

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,440
also uh

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,879
use those for for good and and so i just

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,680
wanted to introduce

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,120
marianna and and henry just say a few

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,479
words about the great things that you do

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
because you really captured the hearts

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,080
of the ibm's involved and you

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,200
overwhelmingly were voted

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,599
in this for this this board

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,560
hi so thank you so much and for inviting

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,560
me to be here

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,680
and to to uh thank you to all ibm

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,040
employees because they they trust in our

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,839
in our purpose and and we are really

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,920
grateful to

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,279
to be here to be selected to this

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,640
wonderful grant

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,920
because uh it is hopefully

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,080
it supports our cows with creating more

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,440
impact in our community in colombia

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,760
and in our region latin america region

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
thank you and and you do great work down

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,440
there and

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,080
you've spread to all sorts of areas that

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
really

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,160
you know are underprivileged that need

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,920
the support and the help and

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,680
and we at ibm really love what you're

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
doing so thank you very much and we

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,959
appreciate everything you're doing

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,519
thank you we are we are super excited

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,320
because

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,480
er this is our first grant we are

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,440
creating this community with no resource

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,120
and we receive a little amount of

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
research for

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,399
local companies to create meetups and

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
and have

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,519
like our t-shirts and our

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,959
legal registration as a foundation in

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,120
colombia but

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:57,440
we never tried to to apply to a grant

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
and because we believe that we need to

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,640
be sure what

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
was the right moment to do it and right

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,959
now it feels like

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,640
really really amazing to have this

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
opportunity to have this resource to

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,839
create more

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,480
impact because our dream is to reach

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
seven

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,800
countries in colombia and main cities

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,240
and we have a special project in rural

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,360
areas when they don't have

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,399
um like a network or connectivity

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
and so our dream is impact more

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,560
indigenous people

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,160
and perhaps and we have uh an

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,600
um african uh really

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,600
african heritage and and and they don't

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,040
have the same opportunities here

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,519
in colombia and as as

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,399
as our in the mean city so we are trying

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,760
to to reach their rural areas and try to

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,320
create an impact in in other in other

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,880
places excellent well thank you again

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,600
thank you for all the great work you do

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,680
organization is very deserving and

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
hopefully this won't be the last time we

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,640
get to see you

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,640
thank you thought thank you and now to

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,440
talk about unlocking the full value of

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,959
open source

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,680
i i would like to introduce camille

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,519
sharp global business line executive

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
for technology support services here at

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
ibm camellia

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
thanks todd my name is camilla sharp and

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,240
i'm the global business line executive

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,920
for ibm's multi-vendor software support

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,680
i'm very excited to be speaking today at

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,320
open source summit north america this is

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,399
an event that i participated in myself

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
and so it's just a pleasure to be here

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,360
i've actually been asked to speak a

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
little bit about ibm's open source

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,880
support practice

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
now as todd mentioned earlier we are all

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,240
experiencing an

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,000
unprecedented time in history right now

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,560
and organizations are being forced

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
to adopt to new challenges and they're

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,320
really looking for ways on how to

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,320
rethink how business is done

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
i'm fortunate enough to work within an

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,360
area of ibm where we can help our

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
clients address some of those big

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
challenges

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,760
specifically we provide support

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,079
solutions for

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,519
multi-vendor software products and this

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,240
also includes focusing

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,320
on open source technologies so providing

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,480
support solutions for commercial as well

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,560
as community open source software

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,920
now about six months ago um we actually

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,959
commissioned a study with forester

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,040
consulting

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,120
because we wanted to examine in depth

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,120
how our clients were using open source

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,639
software across their enterprises

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,720
and one area that we focused on

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,600
specifically was really around the

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,760
challenges

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
that organizations face when they're not

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,800
only building with

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,200
but also deploying and maintaining

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,680
solutions built on open technologies

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
so what we wanted to do was identify you

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,240
know some of those key adoption

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,680
challenges

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,000
and some of those inhibitors that

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,360
organizations face when deploying

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,200
you know open source at scale so in my

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,760
opinion if we were to rerun that study

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,519
today

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,440
i do think that we would see the biggest

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,480
challenges you know the same ones

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,000
popping up

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
but i do feel that they would be viewed

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
through a slightly different lens and

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,160
that's just what i wanted to talk a

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,480
little bit about today

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,920
you know enterprises are now trying to

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
figure out how they move their

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,200
businesses forward

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,639
while adjusting to a lot of different

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
things so whether that's you know a

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,959
remote workforce whether

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,279
it's new ways of you know selling and

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,680
delivering services and products

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,000
um or of course you know additional cost

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,440
pressures that we often see

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
so a couple of the ones that have

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,560
changed slightly um again in my opinion

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
um are the ones that i've got listed

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
here so

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,279
first let's talk a little bit about

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,720
governance now in my experience if you

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,000
ask 10 different people what

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,200
governance means you're going to get 10

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
different answers because it's a very

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
broad topic

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,760
but when i talk about governance it

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,440
really refers to kind of the people and

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,360
processes that are used to create a

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
management system around technology

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,920
usage

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,839
and we're finding that this is actually

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
a really hot topic right now

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,279
um obviously it's because we're using

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,040
you know we see customers using more and

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,480
more open technologies for mission

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,399
critical i.t

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
um but they're also looking for help

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,720
with a much broader set of services

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,560
and i would actually argue that all the

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,360
challenges that you see listed here on

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,040
the page

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
um they're actually all elements of a

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,279
good governance solution

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,199
one that's still hot you know top of

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,920
mind for customers is complex software

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,360
stacks

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,360
you know as we continue to see the

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,680
acceleration of digital transformation

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,199
initiatives it's not uncommon for you

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,360
know our customers to be using

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,720
10 or even a lot more different packages

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
when they're creating individual

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,519
solutions

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,199
and what this challenge is it's really

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,199
about making sure that you know

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,399
all of those different packages they all

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,240
work together in harmony

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,760
and they stay that way when something in

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
the environment changes

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,360
another one that's top of mind right now

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,720
is really around choice it's having too

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,800
much choice so

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,560
initially uh this was about selecting

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,320
the right technology so what were the

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,079
technologies that were best suited to

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
achieve your business objectives

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,199
um but this is actually taken on a whole

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,519
new context because what we're seeing

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
now

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,880
is that enterprises are really trying to

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,079
determine if this is an area of cost

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,639
optimization

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,120
and we get lots of questions around that

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,480
um

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
and the other one i'd like to talk about

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,920
is really just enterprise support

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,839
um you know another trend that we

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,680
continue to see is that organizations

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,320
are leveraging more and more community

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
open source

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,760
in production and there's a lot of

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
different reasons for that but

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,440
one of the biggest challenges they face

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,279
when they do this is around support

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,720
so it's the lack of enterprise quality

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,199
support for these products

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,000
and that's really where my team comes in

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,079
so look

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,839
my organization we work with our

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,160
customers to build comprehensive support

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,079
solutions for the open ecosystem

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,839
you know our goal is to help address and

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,760
build solutions for all of the

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,079
challenges that i've just discussed

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,519
now a lot of people know us um and are

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,920
familiar with the fact that we've been

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,199
providing support on the linux operating

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
system and a lot of commercial

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,399
open source products you know in excess

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,079
of of two decades

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,000
but they're not familiar with our

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,440
broader portfolio of services

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,360
which includes actually our community

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,120
open source support offering and this is

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,040
where we have the ability to provide

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,279
that enterprise class support

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
on over 150 different versions of

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,600
community open source products

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,759
now the other thing is around our

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,440
advisory services so that's where we

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,839
provide assistance to clients around

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,880
things like interoperability guidance

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,279
installation configuration really just

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,480
different services to help address

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,639
some of these challenges that i just

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,320
talked about today so look if you're

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,240
part of a development team or you're a

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,480
business leader and you're facing some

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,440
of those challenges that i've covered

i would love to talk to you so please

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,799
relationship between

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
jenkins and cloudbees sharing his

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,480
lessons learned

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,039
and how to build business uh value

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,760
around

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,480
a viable open source project please

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,920
welcome

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,009
kosuke kawaguchi

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,009
[Music]

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,000
hi i'm kosuke i created this open source

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,120
project called jenkins about 15 years

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,280
ago

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,720
and then for the last 10 years or so

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,440
until very recently

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,200
i've been involved in cloudbees where i

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,960
was a key part of

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,120
building a business around this open

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
source project and in that process

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,039
i learned a lot so today i wanted to

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,559
talk about that lessons

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,280
no my experience on building a business

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,760
around by an open source project

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,880
so um so yeah i guess i already talked a

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,799
little bit about myself

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,400
um i you know i started as a open source

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,799
developer and then

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,480
they became a cto of this company and

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,840
spent a you know a good bit of time

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,960
trying to bridge this relationship

00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,679
between the company and the source

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
project so

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,880
much of what i talked about today kind

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,400
of came from that experience things that

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,000
got me thinking

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,400
so you know for the context of this

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,640
conversation it's not overly important

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,000
what club beast has or what jenkins is

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
as an open source project

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,360
so suffice to say if you think of the

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,960
krabbys at

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,120
jenkins as what the red hat does to

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
linux then hopefully you can

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,280
understand most of what i'm going to

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,080
talk today and that is you know the flip

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,880
side of it is

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,720
i think the lessons that i learned i

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
think it's pretty universal to any open

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,559
source project and any companies trying

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,600
to

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,520
need it so the first thing

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,960
i think that made an impact for this

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,039
project because of its

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,240
meaning was this notion of you know who

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,760
owns the project

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
and usually this is not the first

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,640
questions that the founder

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,720
of the open source project would think

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,840
about because it doesn't really

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,000
you know it feels like it doesn't really

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,600
matter this feels like a subtle

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,480
problems um and that is correct

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,480
but when it matters it actually matters

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,200
a lot and it makes a huge difference

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
so this is something i think it's worth

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,679
thinking about

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,080
um so in case of thinking what happened

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
was that the i used to work outside the

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,880
company

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,320
and at some point they wanted to

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,159
exercise the control

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,679
over the project so the way they chose

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,880
to do it is by

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,720
you know the trade claiming the

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,640
trademark to the name of the project

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,400
and then they told the developers that

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,000
if they want to continue doing something

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,919
they better accept the control by the

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,520
guy by the company so this

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,360
actually obviously pissed off the open

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,760
source developers royally

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,280
so that's how you know the new name was

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,640
adopted in jenkins and that's how the

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,840
product was born

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,960
so um because of that

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,320
origin story i'm very happy to oops i'm

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,440
very happy to say

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,760
uh jenkins is a community-owned project

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,640
so that is you know that is why this

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,919
product joined

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,960
the linux foundations uh so that um

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,799
we have a neutral place where the

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,400
product name means product is governed

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,480
by

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,320
because i think one of the things that

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
lessons that fiasco in the beginning

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,320
that i just talked about

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,840
taught me is that the products open

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,799
source products that is owned by one

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,799
company

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,559
is fundamentally risky even if the

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,880
current owner is well behaving

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,600
benevolent in an owner that steward of

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,760
the product

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,360
it is still just one wrong acquisition

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,200
away from a disaster

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,960
and that was exactly what happened to my

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,799
previous employer so

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,559
you know in order for other companies

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,640
other participants to feel

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,000
the ownership stake into this product

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,440
and feeling comfortable

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
you know putting the precious engineers

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,679
time to this project

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,520
i came to believe it's so much better to

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,760
utilize the foundations like next

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,679
foundations or in apache or eclipse or

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,520
really anything to do in that regard

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,280
and i think i i think they drive the

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,480
participation in ways that otherwise

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,799
impossible

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,240
but so i'm very proud of this setup but

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,280
at the same time for business it does

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,880
create challenges

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,039
because you know your sales people and

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,880
marketing people can get so much value

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,080
i look more straightforward association

00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
between the company

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,760
and the project when they are one and

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,400
the same so i think a good example that

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,159
might be

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,919
you know like a docker right the docker

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,760
the company and talk or the product

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,360
run on the same there's no need to

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,520
explain those two things

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,799
in the relationship i can't say the same

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,640
thing with clarisse and jenkins

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,240
so this is something the leadership of

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,120
the company needs to be able to

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,559
understand and articulate and defend um

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,159
and then there'll be always the constant

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,000
questions of like why this setup is

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,480
chosen

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
another sort of key question for me um

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,280
in the club is

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
was how to balance out the open source

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,640
investment against the

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,159
company interest you know like

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,960
engineering resources are always

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,240
precious like

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,400
the regardless of the size of the

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,600
company so there's always this tension

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,280
between how much of that

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,280
should be spent on pushing open source

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,240
forward versus pushing the company

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,760
forward

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,480
so um i think for too long i feel like i

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,799
failed to

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,760
frame that into the right term so from

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,919
one side

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,679
you know one set of people are arguing

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,760
for more investment in open source

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
from the other side you know some other

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
set of people are looking for more

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,559
investment in the product

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,840
and it kind of became a nasty tiger war

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,120
and in the end like whoever

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,120
controls the resources between so

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
that's somewhat there's a little bit

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,240
like this tension between devs and ops

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,799
and how the

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,200
devops the movement uh kind of came into

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,960
being so an extra shame like on my hand

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
i was speaking for that kind of message

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,280
but on the other side like i i failed to

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,159
see the parallel between those two nasty

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,600
stories

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,799
so i think in looking back i wish

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,039
i spent more time figuring out

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,480
what is the right metrics that guides us

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,679
the right level of investment between

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,559
open source and

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,000
the you know the um the proprietary

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,360
product side

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,799
how do we sort of what are the lines in

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,760
which we connect

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,720
the open source products thriving viable

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,240
open source project

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,400
to the overall success and health of the

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,840
business because i i think every

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
reasonable company leadership would

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
understand

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,440
that the right investment level is not

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,840
zero um

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,760
but the line between you know the the

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,440
effort that's spent open source

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,880
and how it contributes to the company

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,919
needs to be drawn even if

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,240
the metrics might feel a little bit

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,760
 um even in that i think there's

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
still about you in having some guideline

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,880
the baseline

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,679
that other people agree on so that you

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,400
don't have to like

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,120
turn every fight into you know the type

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
of war

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,559
so that's that that coming up is that

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,240
matrix is something i

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,880
feel um i am the english underinvested

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,360
and i still don't have the right answer

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,679
but

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,279
i think if i get to do the next next

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,480
round i think i know

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,200
how to do this a little better so anyway

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,720
um you know off onto how to make

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,760
business side of open source projects so

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,159
the first thing

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,240
the the young club is the company did

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,720
was to build a hosting service hosted

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,320
service or this open source project

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,480
so you know the service hosted service

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,320
was great but one because

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,240
you know the you don't need to keep any

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,120
changes you make proprietary in fact

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,120
it's so much easier

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,039
if you can push them all upstream so in

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,400
the early days when we didn't have that

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,720
many engineers working on it

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,320
the fact that our engineers can both

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,240
push their services forward

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,919
and also the open source project forward

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,080
at the same time from one commit

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,080
has been incredibly useful to make us

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,400
look bigger than we actually were

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,240
um and hosting also very nicely

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,640
complements a key pain of open source

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,000
which is the overhead and timing the

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,039
effort it takes to keep

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the software running so so those were

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,440
great

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,440
but unfortunately jenkins was not

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,919
designed with this kind of

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,559
high density multi-tenancy hosting in

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,080
mind

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,600
and these are the things that's very

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,400
difficult to like insert

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,520
from after the fact so in the long run

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
you know they

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,200
they couldn't make economics work well

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,240
enough so this business sort of faded

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,000
away but

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
nonetheless it provided this great

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,880
fourth stage of the rocket that allows

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,760
us to take on

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,080
the next way of adding value which is

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,520
the

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,320
enterprise version so um

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,200
enterprise version was great um for all

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,200
sorts of reasons

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,360
right it allows us to create a bigger

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,559
value it allows the company to build up

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,000
more ip

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,000
um and then you know sell that to

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,159
multiple people and you know charge the

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,240
full price for each one of those

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,480
like unlike hosting where you know every

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,880
every value you sell it comes with a

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,320
high

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,279
you know cost of goods sold so

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,960
so that was great um but it also not

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,159
great in the sense that it created a

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,760
bandwidth challenge

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,679
so this was around the time when this

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,240
type of war was the most difficult

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,600
because your engineer is either working

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,200
on the open source project

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,640
or they are working the product because

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,039
they are the completely different code

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
base

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,080
and when they work on the products they

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
you know from the perspective open

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,159
source

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,320
it's it's it's as good as it's not it's

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,120
indistinguishable from them disappearing

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,240
so you end up needing to chase those two

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,159
different bars

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,000
and that's been that's that's painful

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,400
and challenge and there's also

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,080
another one subtle challenge that i'm

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,720
going to try to explain here

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,919
so if you think about like a space or

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,919
body

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,360
that the open source could provide and

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,039
already dissolve

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,559
right so naturally there's this like

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,360
organic growth right

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,120
this circle d presents the program that

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,640
all open source already solved

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,400
and then what's happening is that around

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,760
the edges and the peripherals

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,679
people are constantly pushing that

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,159
envelope out and it tends to kind of

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,200
grow

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,399
over time slowly but steadily what the

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,799
enterprise version does

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,200
in essence is that it sticks a

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,840
neighboring space of problem and value

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
and then solve that in a separate circle

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,760
right

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,919
so where this gets a problem

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,039
is like imagine like you're some of your

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,240
engineers

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,200
in your company working on the open

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,600
source project they are incentivized

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,640
to not to grow open source into the

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,399
directions

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,960
toward the enterprise version that's

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,240
what this arrow is trying to represent

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,440
you don't want the open source products

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,559
to solve the same problem that the

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,840
enterprise version is

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,600
solving because that's where you make

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,480
money right

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,679
so if not managed carefully what this

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,919
ends up doing is

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,159
it sort of it could interfere with the

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,880
natural organic way of open source

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,640
growing and you can end up creating this

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,080
station when somebody who is not

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,240
if it doesn't have that bias when they

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,279
look at it they might feel like there's

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,320
this obvious growing

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,799
big pain that every key contributed

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,080
product seems to be obliviously right

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,279
and of course what's happening is that

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,480
it's not that they're obvious to this

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,679
program they're just they just don't

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,039
want to solve that in the open source

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,480
because they feel like that's the value

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,360
that the enterprise version was supposed

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,880
to provide

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,960
um so if you know the the what

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,320
i guess what i'm trying to say is in the

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,440
eyes of outsiders

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,039
you know they don't appreciate those

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,840
internal motivation why the product

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,360
doesn't

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,880
solve this you know doesn't solve this

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,799
pain it doesn't solve these challenges

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,320
why it has this giant pain so they might

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,640
simply choose to go elsewhere

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,360
and that in the long run can cast a

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
shadow

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,600
in the viability of the open source

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,360
project and that is not good

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,200
so anyway the third thing that the

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,640
company this club is taking on is the

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,640
support

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,240
and this was also great if you can get

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,080
there and i say that because in the

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,200
early days of the small company

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,200
you know let's say you have just a

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,600
signal with your engineers

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,799
you cannot you can't provide the support

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,919
in a straight phase

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,279
you know you need something you need to

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,039
achieve a sufficient scale and

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,520
credibility as a business before

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,200
companies would come to you and ask you

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,480
to take your money to provide them

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,320
the support so once you get there though

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,720
it's really great because you know your

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,399
customers will drive you to improve open

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,679
source like they're coming to you to

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,320
solve the pain they have in the open

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,960
source

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,320
and they they actually much power if the

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,760
the way you solve it is

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,679
also a part of the open source so the

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
boss is in something else so that's

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,120
great and it's like um

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,480
the it was the same station with the

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,279
hosting stations

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,279
except um what you need to be careful is

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,679
the people who

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,360
who buy support from you are actually a

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,720
small subset

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,480
of small uneven subset of your audience

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,720
so if you end up spending too much time

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,840
to solve their problems and neglect the

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,120
other larger number of smaller ordinary

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,279
voiceless users

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,399
then you might end up creating this kind

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,559
of skew

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,559
to um in the open source project again

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,159
as well so for example you might you

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,080
know you might cater to more complex use

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,080
cases more flexibility etc

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,760
and you might not value the ease of use

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,000
or ease of installation or somebody who

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,279
is only using it casually

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,720
and that's so that can be a problem

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,720
and it also you know support

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,640
fundamentally relies on the fact that

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,960
your product is somewhat painful

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,960
to use and that's not a lydia healthy

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,840
long-term tenable stations

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,240
because the same frustrations that led

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,120
your

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,840
users to become your customers can also

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
push them

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,360
to your computing solutions and you you

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,360
know you not only lose the revenue but

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,360
you might also lose the user

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,880
so um so i think in some sense this

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,000
this sort of underscores the importance

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,279
of figuring out the right level of

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,720
investment in open source

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,559
almost obvious and then kind of give

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,159
them in a free hand so that they can

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,640
solve the problems they see in the open

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,399
source period

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,000
but you know with all that said i really

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,840
think the support is a great

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,840
way to add value like it really adds

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,760
value it makes the open source projects

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,640
former credible in the eyes of the users

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,559
for example

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,480
um and support is so much more than just

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,760
asking you know answering questions and

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,799
that's something i learned

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,600
uh over the time in kirby's so

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,159
i highly recommend it anyway so the last

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,640
phase

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,240
i think of this business to open source

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,760
relationship is that the business choose

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,760
to move up stuck

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,760
so in the process of you know getting to

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,559
know your customers and users

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,440
so well um and your company getting

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,279
bigger

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,200
you can now tackle on the bigger

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,799
challenges that the customers are facing

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,799
that increase the open source as a part

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,080
of it but it's not the whole thing

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,159
and i feel like that's certainly what

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,000
happened to the cab is when we tackled

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,840
the software delivery management which

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,760
is to say how the organization tackles

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,519
the effectiveness of the library uh

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,880
where it's which naturally includes cicd

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,080
as a part of it but that's not the

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,320
entirety so so finally like we could

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,279
you know some of these second dilemmas

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,919
and conflicts that i talked about

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,320
earlier are no longer the problem for us

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,960
so um i'm going to be i'm short on time

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,559
so

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,080
let me quickly talk about some of the

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,559
other lessons i learned

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,600
in the course of classism thinkings and

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,919
one is that

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,120
you know as an ambassador from the from

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,760
the company making money

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,320
in and around open source for this um

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,840
you

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,440
don't you don't need to be apologetic

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,640
about the fact that your participation

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,480
into this open source product

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,840
is bringing revenue to your company and

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,360
you don't obviously don't want to become

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,880
descending either

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,159
but for example like you need to help

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
other people in the community see the

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,320
value

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,320
that your company brings to the

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,559
community including for example the

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,240
credibility that it brings the project

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,840
which i just mentioned about or the fact

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,320
that the company template other

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,600
functions like design marketing event

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,600
and so on so forth

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,640
to the product and that does not happen

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,760
in the organic

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,320
in a pure developer community right

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,159
um or like a company can put together

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,720
organized team of engineers to take on a

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,559
bigger

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,000
big effort which is traditionally it's

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,360
difficult for bounty volunteers to

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,080
coordinate

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,760
um also early on when the company was

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,039
small we only had people who

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,120
knew how to roll in the open source

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,159
project so you know it was easy but as a

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,240
company were bigger

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,919
and we wanted to put other function

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,519
people than developers

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,919
um it's kind of important to help them

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,960
understand how to be effective in open

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,799
source projects

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,799
um like there's this tendency to you

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,960
know what you don't want to be is like a

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,559
you come across as a faceless group of

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,880
people and then like

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,159
hiding behind the banner of the company

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,000
like you know we all know that

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,200
what makes the open source project is a

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,880
human relationship a personal

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,760
relationship between participants and

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,760
that's something

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,880
i think important for the your your

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,880
company people understand

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,320
like they need to be able to engage with

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,039
the other participants in the protest on

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
their own

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,399
and there it's okay for them to have

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,960
their own opinions um

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,760
and uh it also means i think the product

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,519
needs to evolve

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,039
to accept the fact that there are other

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,679
participants people not writing source

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,080
code and they

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,960
are actually an important part of the

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,039
community

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,960
so educating that i think is also

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,880
important um

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,159
and you know the hiring people from the

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,640
community has also been

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,399
interesting questions and challenges so

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,600
you know it was great that you can bring

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,960
in qualified people

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,200
from day one um but it also creates

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,800
by became like a higher contributors of

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,000
the community into your company

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,159
but it also tends to create a

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,599
monoculture because they are kind of all

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,720
the fact that they are being a long-time

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,280
contributor

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,040
um they tend to you know it tends to

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,520
bring like-minded folks

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,879
um and so that's and that makes that

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,119
creates a certain blind spot

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,639
like it kind of creates a grip thing and

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,359
that makes it difficult for that group

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,440
to address

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,639
the pain that other people from other

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,159
backgrounds would see

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,760
so i kind of fundamentally believe in

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,679
this diversity

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,440
and i don't just mean like you know like

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,720
a race or the gender

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,079
but really like a different background

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,079
different perceptions and different

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,480
values they placed on the technology and

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,399
those

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,919
i think the conversation and extending

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,079
of ideas among these people

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,599
actually pretty critical to create a

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,320
thriving open source project

00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,240
so um and then another part is like as

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,200
you get bigger and you keep hiring from

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,160
the community

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,760
you naturally like lose that and then

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,079
some of these people you put on to work

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,920
on

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,920
other things than open source you start

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,599
to deplete the pool of contributors from

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,200
the product and that's not great

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:19,440
um so um these people can be

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,040
you know um yeah anyway so that

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,440
i can i can talk a lot about this point

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,040
but um in in just a time let's move on

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,680
so the last bit is that

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,079
the it's sort of important they always

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,839
have some level of creative distractions

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,359
i think in a viable open source project

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,000
this naturally happens

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,560
or else it didn't have survive but the

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,359
company

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,079
i think tends to coordinate its act

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,079
together

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,920
far more than a bunch of volunteer open

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,000
source developers are willing to do

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,400
so they tend to you know they tend to

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,359
not want to run this experiment so like

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,720
wild shot

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,320
um and then etc now

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,200
so then that coordination is great

00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,480
because that's what makes the

00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,760
organization effective

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,000
but if you think about it if you have to

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,839
convince everyone about something

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,680
that you want to do then you only get to

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,920
really do incremental improvements

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,000
and that's great that's okay for a while

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,200
but in the long run that just alone

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,839
is going to kill innovations so

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,680
i you know if everything needs to be

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,119
aligned then also like none of these

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,640
efforts can fail because it's so

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,720
interdependent on each other

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,480
and if you cannot take on projects that

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,599
might fail then again you're not gonna

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,599
have innovations

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,880
so i sort of like one thing i learned is

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,320
it's important to have a little bit of

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,960
slack like a little bit of willingness

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,960
to say

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,000
well this may or may not work out and be

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,920
able to take that on

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,440
and be able to kill them if you discover

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,240
that it is not working yet

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,440
so if you wrap that up you know in the

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,040
end i kind of feel like i've been

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,440
telling you a whole lot so why

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,440
why this is a challenge so i want to end

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,280
my com like talk on a high note

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,359
you know despite all the challenges you

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,000
know i still very much believe in open

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,680
source

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,040
because open source is in the world like

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,960
it's just hands down

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,640
better way of developing software it

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,400
creates more flexible software it

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,800
creates more higher quality software

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
it evolves faster and you know like i'm

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,960
i'm preaching this to

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,960
the roomful of believers so um but i

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,680
really think it's true like it helps us

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,440
tap into

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,599
diverse set of talents from around the

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,119
world coming from different perspectives

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,400
and different parts of tech stack

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,320
and collectively i think even though

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,079
you're not perfect i think it just tends

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,599
to create a far better software than

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,000
group of engineers working for the same

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,400
company

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
from coming from the similar origin um

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,320
and i just fundamentally have this idea

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,160
like

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,680
you know from anywhere from the world we

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,440
can work together and

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,920
you know like this just does not happen

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,640
in so many other like modern primations

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,920
so i think the open source business

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,960
complement this effort

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,920
and it helps helps the world have more

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,920
open source

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,000
so that i think makes this endeavor

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,839
worthwhile and then on that note

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,839
i wanted to end my talk thank you very

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
much

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,640
good morning everyone it's so exciting

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,320
to be here

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,480
and i thought i would start off by

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,480
telling you the back story

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,280
the back story of how i became an

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,160
advocate for inclusive workplaces

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,880
and this is actually my second career in

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,040
my first career i spent about 25 years

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,079
working in tech building software

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,240
products

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,079
i started out as a software engineer

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,480
writing code for a living

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,359
and over time i moved into leadership

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,359
roles

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,760
and most recently i was a vice president

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,960
of engineering at adobe

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,480
and during that 25 years i noticed a

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,920
decline happening

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,240
a decline in gender diversity and

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,640
so while i was still at adobe i started

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,599
being a very vocal advocate for women at

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,920
the company

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,640
i started our women's employee resource

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,520
group

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,520
i started mentoring a lot of women and

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,440
basically looking out for women across

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,000
the company

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,640
i loved doing that work so much that

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,520
about

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,160
seven eight years ago now i started my

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,320
own business

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,920
as a leadership coach for women working

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,320
in tech

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,160
and that business i love doing that work

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,520
it's very fulfilling i think i help my

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,400
clients

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,160
but i have to tell you all of them are

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,359
working in environments

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,720
where and companies where basically the

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,760
closer you get

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,280
to the c-suite the ceo

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,599
the maler and paler it gets

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,119
and well with all due respect to anyone

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,720
who's male or pale listening to me today

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,640
it's just the demographics it's what it

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,119
looks like in tech

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,079
and so i started paying attention to how

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,440
people could be

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,079
more inclusive at work and not just for

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,720
women

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,839
but for people of color for black people

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,040
for people of different

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,960
religious backgrounds gender sexual

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,160
orientations and identities

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,040
ages abilities i started looking at what

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,760
could we do

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,480
to make all of tech more inclusive i

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,160
kind of wanted to change the world

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,839
and of course these days what's the

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,040
first thing anyone does when they want

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,760
to change the world

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,480
well either you make a hashtag or a

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,480
twitter handle

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,480
and so about five years ago i started

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,319
the twitter handle

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,839
at better allies and this twitter handle

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,079
my goal was to share

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,040
simple everyday actions people could

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,960
take to be more inclusive at work

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,480
things like you know i'm going to notice

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,200
when an interruption happens in a

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,680
meeting

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,040
and redirect the conversation back to

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,079
the person who was interrupted

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,920
i would share things such as well i'm

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,200
going to ask at the next engineering all

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,359
hands what we are doing

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,280
about pay inequity and ask if we can

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,440
you know raise awareness of what pay

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,280
inequity is and do something about it

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,640
these are just simple everyday actions i

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,880
would tweet

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,079
now over time i started getting speaking

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,480
engagements

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,480
and i started speaking about this

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,480
approach this better allies approach of

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,760
simple everyday actions

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,640
and inevitably during the q a someone

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,680
would ask

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,960
hey karen do you have a book and for

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,880
many years i kept saying

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,640
no i don't have a book they're like well

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,400
we'd like more of this we want more of

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,880
these everyday actions this seems so

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,000
approachable and so smart so so

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,599
actionable

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,520
and so i eventually wrote my books um i

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,359
didn't just write one i wrote two um the

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,680
first book is better allies everyday

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,200
actions to create inclusive workplaces

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,160
and i followed it up with the better

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,040
allies approach to hiring

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,079
and i think this topic is actually more

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,760
important than

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,319
ever before because

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,160
in the wake of george floyd's murder and

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,960
countless others

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,800
people around the world and definitely

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,839
here in the united states

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,920
are not satisfied with the status quo

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,680
they do not want the racial inequity to

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,800
continue that we've been seeing

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,319
in our country workplaces and so forth

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,680
so people are protesting

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:08,720
people are donating money people

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,720
are electing new officials and demanding

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,800
policy change

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,760
and i hope that for all of you here

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,599
today

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,280
that in addition to anything else you're

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,160
doing that you will

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,319
also be looking for how you can disrupt

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,520
the status quo in your workplaces

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,680
to be more inclusive

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,440
of people from you know definitely be

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,520
more inclusive of black people

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,119
and people from other underrepresented

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,160
groups

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,880
and i firmly believe that

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,640
this whole job of inclusion you don't

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,760
have to have it on your business card

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,599
you don't have to be your chief

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,440
diversity and inclusion and belonging

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,520
officer to make a difference

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,880
there are things all of us can be doing

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,440
every day

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,319
in our workplaces and in our open source

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,960
communities

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,400
to be more inclusive and so what does

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,920
this look like

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,720
well first up you need to get to know

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
people

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,200
who are different from you from

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,440
different backgrounds and different

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,240
gender orientations and so forth

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,760
you need to get to know people and

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,400
unfortunately

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,839
most of us have these just like me

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,440
networks

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,119
these networks full of people who are

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,720
similar to us because we like hanging

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,520
out with them we have things in common

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,200
with them

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,680
whether that is going to a sporting

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,040
event like these guys here on the slide

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,800
or something else we have something in

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,359
common we like hanging out with them

00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,920
and we tend to be drawn to people who

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,319
are like

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,319
us now

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,920
i want all of you to reflect for a

00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:44,400
minute

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,000
about your own professional network

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,480
would you say it is

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,000
very diverse somewhat diverse

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:58,480
or you could do better

00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,720
i bet as you reflect on your own network

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,400
you most of us would probably vote on

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,839
number two or three here like we have

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,160
some work to do they're not super

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,359
diverse

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,760
and i want you to think especially if

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,319
you are

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,920
white listening to me i want you to

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,319
think about

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,920
what the experience might be for for

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:23,839
example just one demographic

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:26,319
a black woman a black woman in your work

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,240
place or community what's her experience

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,920
like

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,280
and i'm going to share some survey

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,160
results

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,599
where black women surveyed said their

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,280
manager has met

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,560
one-on-one with other people on their

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,560
team but not with them

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,760
another survey of uh found that black

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,079
women um

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,119
and uh i apologize that's supposed to

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,160
say 60

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,560
almost 60 percent report that they've

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,079
never had an informal interaction with a

00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,839
senior leader

00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,160
more than half of black women have never

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,720
had a senior had a senior leader

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,160
do things and say things like well you

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,760
know how was your weekend

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,960
maybe in the coffee room or the break

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,880
room or in the elevator into the office

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,720
they've never had a senior leader reach

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,319
out to them in a virtual chat saying hey

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,160
nice to see you here

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,760
right those are what informal

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,920
interactions are like

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,200
and those lead to feeling belonging

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,520
inclusion in the workplace

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,720
i'll also say what happens outside of

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,200
work

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,720
outside of work there's social science

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,440
research showing that

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,319
men tend to hang out with other male

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,880
co-workers

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,079
whether that's on the golf course or a

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,640
virtual poker game

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,359
or something else but men tend to hang

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,280
out with male

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,280
coworkers and that deepens and

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,839
strengthens their professional network

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,400
even though they're outside the office

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,960
women

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,319
by contrast we tend to hang out with

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,720
people in our community

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,680
people whether we um perhaps we're in a

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,040
book club or

00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,880
we are volunteering at a non-profit or

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,560
if we have young children we're hanging

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,400
out with parents at their school

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,599
perhaps it's a religious organization we

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,400
belong to

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,079
so we women our strengths are broadening

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,800
our network but not strengthening the

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,760
deep

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,640
professional ties like the men and over

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,800
time

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,839
that really adds up it adds up in terms

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,160
of this inequity

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,680
in terms of how powerful a network can

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,599
be

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,520
and these just like me networks really

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,480
limit diversity

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,680
let's face it you know as we think about

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,839
who we hire

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,720
we look to our networks we trust those

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,560
people

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,800
we want to hire them and recommend them

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,680
we know them we know they can do the job

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,640
so if we have homogenous networks we

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,760
will hire homogeneity

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:49,119
and these just like me networks also

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,880
impact who we trust who we trust at work

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,440
or in our communities

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,319
as we think about stretch assignments

00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,480
new leadership positions promotions

00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,079
maybe if we're doing a reorganization or

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,359
doing some succession planning as a

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,560
leader

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,000
we know and trust

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,000
the people we've been hanging out with

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,119
we've been spending time with

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,480
and those are the people we're going to

00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:16,079
put forth for these new opportunities

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,480
so i want to share four everyday actions

00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,520
all of you can take to diversify your

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,119
network

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,960
and the first is get to know colleagues

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,280
who don't look like you

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,960
sounds so obvious but the next time

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,400
you're at a live event

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,680
you know go over and say hello to

00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,000
someone during a networking opportunity

00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,440
perhaps it is doing something more

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,200
virtually as well but

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,319
get to know them introduce yourself

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,319
start a conversation

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,599
i also recommend you join slack channels

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:46,319
or other forums

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,359
for underrepresented groups many of them

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,040
exist

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:51,119
and all you have to do is ask permission

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,079
if you as not a member of that

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,319
demographic

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,160
can join so you can listen and learn

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,119
about the conversation

00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,119
and get to know people

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,559
you can also attend events for people

00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,680
from different underrepresented groups

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,119
for example i am a white woman i've

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,040
recently been to some

00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,240
black in tech events which have been

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,839
incredibly insightful

00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,280
powerful and i've gotten to know new

00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,319
people

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,680
um i'm i am straight i could attend a

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,240
lesbian zootech event

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,079
again to get to know folks understand

00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,599
the conversations understand some of the

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,520
discussions they're having

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,040
these events are out there they're easy

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,880
to attend virtually

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,800
and if you're not sure you'd be welcome

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,480
again just ask the organizers or check

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,319
the website they're often

00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,880
open to allies and last but not least

00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,319
look to volunteer with non-profits who

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,440
are serving these marginalized

00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:47,200
communities

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,000
non-profits such as maybe there is a

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,079
robotics

00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,520
program at a local high school that you

00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,480
could volunteer with

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,839
or be a mentor virtually for a coding

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,680
boot camp that serves one of these

00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,000
communities

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,760
these are just some ideas of how you can

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,240
diversify your network

00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,520
but that really is the step first step

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,880
in being a better ally

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,040
and creating a more inclusive

00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,000
environment

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,119
so once you have diversified your

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,880
network

00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,680
you can get started with the next step

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,160
which is to sponsor people

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,400
what does sponsorship look like maybe

00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,960
you have formal programs at your company

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,599
that's great but you can also look to

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,599
sponsor

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,760
in smaller ways without having it be a

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:34,000
formal network a formal program

00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,960
here are five things you can think about

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,119
doing

00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,319
to sponsor people from underrepresented

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,319
groups co-workers

00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:43,040
colleagues members of open source

00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:45,760
communities that you belong to

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,200
the first is recommend them for stretch

00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,559
assignments and speaking

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:53,520
opportunities you know these

00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,760
things are like these rocket booster

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,400
rocket fuel for one's career

00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,760
they help someone gain visibility they

00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,920
open doors

00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,200
they help someone build credibility with

00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,480
a group

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,160
so as you think about the next time

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,160
you have to recommend someone for a

00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,640
speaking opportunity it could just be at

00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,040
your

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,240
engineering all hands or at a big

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,839
conference

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,359
think about who just normally comes to

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,040
mind

00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,280
and if that is not someone from an

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,760
underrepresented group maybe take a step

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,680
back

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,839
reflect on your network think about

00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,520
someone else that you could recommend

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,880
and if no one comes to mind from an

00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,720
underrepresented group

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,640
well maybe you need to go back to the

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,200
first step and diversify your network

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,720
more

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,240
so that you do know these people they're

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,200
out there they're talented they're

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,400
skilled

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:44,160
they can do the job

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,160
second thing is endorse them publicly

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,200
you know i was on the receiving end of

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,880
one of these

00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,599
endorsements and it felt so good

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,359
i mentioned i used to work at adobe and

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,760
when i first joined the company

00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,520
i remember being in a large engineering

00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,040
leadership meeting

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:06,640
and i heard my boss who was a very

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,640
respected long-time employee

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,839
and senior vice president of engineering

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,200
i heard my boy

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:16,400
my boss say well what i learned from

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,160
karen is the following and he went on to

00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,040
say something

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,559
those few words of what i learned from

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,440
karen

00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,559
were a game changer for me they elevated

00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,359
my standing with my

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:32,160
new peers this very respected person

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,240
learned something from me

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,760
he gave me credibility in the moment

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,640
which was long lasting and

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,079
it as i said it felt really good so

00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,599
that's one example of how you can

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,079
endorse someone publicly is

00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,800
share something you learn from them

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,319
there are other ways to do this too

00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,400
think about how you endorse people

00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,960
publicly again and think about upping

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,640
your game

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,839
and doing it even more for people from

00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,839
underrepresented groups

00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:02,720
third thing share their career goals

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,240
with influencers with decision makers as

00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,240
you get to know people

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,680
from underrepresented groups do you know

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,839
what they want to be doing

00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,200
do they want to move ahead on the career

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,800
ladder

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,559
do they want to work in some new

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,200
technology space

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,160
do they want to get involved in you know

00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,760
if it's an open source

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,520
community with one of your leadership

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,760
roles down the road

00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,720
find out what they want to be doing and

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,240
then

00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,559
look for opportunities to connect the

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,559
dots for them to these opportunities

00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,359
fourth invite them to high profile

00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,040
meetings

00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,880
now you may be thinking oh my gosh i had

00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,400
so many meetings already who would want

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,319
to go to another meeting

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,160
but these high profile meetings can be

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,359
game changers for people who aren't

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,480
normally invited

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:51,520
high profile meetings such as you know

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,520
a customer advisory meeting or

00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,280
some strategic planning meeting where

00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,880
you're planning the future

00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,040
or it could just be you know virtual

00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,839
drinks with some newly

00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,400
hired you know vip at your company or in

00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:06,319
your organization

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,240
look to invite people from these groups

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,079
who don't really don't have access

00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,440
so they can start expanding their

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,119
network with those people

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,040
but also have insight into the

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,079
conversations that are happening in the

00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,760
room

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,440
and if you feel like you need permission

00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,040
before you invite someone go ahead and

00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,319
get the permission that's fine if you

00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,319
don't ask it's not going to happen

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,480
and fifth last but not least i encourage

00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,280
you to speak their name

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,240
when they're not around what do i mean

00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,640
by this

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,520
i was watching a ted talk by carla

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,880
harris

00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:42,400
and carla harris was a or is

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:45,280
a senior vice chairman at morgan stanley

00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,040
and she gave a ted talk in 2018 where

00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:51,119
she talked about

00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:53,200
meritocracy or the lack thereof actually

00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,040
she talked and debunked the myth that

00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,119
all you have to do to get ahead

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,720
is to do good work and that people will

00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,520
notice and you'll

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,440
advance she debunked that myth and

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,280
instead pointed out how powerful

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,359
and how important it is to have someone

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,880
who is in those calibration meetings in

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,359
those promotion meetings

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,800
someone who is speaking your name and

00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,119
who knows you well enough

00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,559
to talk about your accomplishments and

00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,240
your potential

00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,000
so this is a powerful way to sponsor

00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,280
someone is get to know them enough so

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,480
that you can speak their name and

00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,760
advocate for them

00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,720
in the meetings you're attending

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,520
all right so a quick note from my open

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:34,079
source friends out there

00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,000
there is language that we use in tech

00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,559
that is not inclusive

00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,880
and here are just two examples now let's

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,359
use a blacklist to deny access to our

00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,839
trial product or our service

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,520
or the master slave architecture that

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,200
we've configured for our servers our

00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,440
database or whatever

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,119
these are not very inclusive at all and

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,319
i encourage all of you to think about

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,119
changing your open source code to be

00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,799
more inclusive

00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,400
a simple instead of blacklist it could

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,079
be a block list that's what you're doing

00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,640
you're blocking access

00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,280
instead of master slave something like

00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,520
primary

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,200
replica for example maybe you don't like

00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,280
that exact phrasing that's fine

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,079
choose something that you think is is

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,720
appropriate for your technology

00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,559
okay i'm gonna wrap it up now and i hope

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,359
that through my talk today

00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,319
you also feel enjoy want to join me on

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,359
this journey of

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,280
like inclusion being a job for everyone

00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,960
not just for people who have diversity

00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,480
inclusion and belonging on their

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,079
on their business card there's something

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,000
we all can do

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,599
and if you'd like to learn more about

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,119
this i have my books i

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,680

allies i also have a newsletter that i

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,440

00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,720
what i've seen during the week

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,559
and provide these tangible everyday

00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,720
actions people can take

00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,440
and you can also follow me on social

00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:59,920

00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:02,960
and a final note i will head over to the

00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,200
slack channel called 2 track

00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,880

there for about the next 15 or 20

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,880
minutes and answer any questions and

00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,480
continue the conversation there

00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:17,839

talk and

00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:29,440
i i loved your book uh particularly the

00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,000
chapter on everyday language i i have to

00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,200
admit

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,640
i have been trying to uh

00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:39,040
eradicate the term guys from my language

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,760
which just almost became a verbal tick

00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,160
but you

00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,319
have some pointers in your book uh and

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,720
i'm gonna keep working on that

00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:47,599
uh so i really appreciate the work

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,760
you're doing and

00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,880
and your book really is an inspiration

00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,319
people should go out

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:58,160
and get that book uh you also mentioned

00:56:54,319 --> 00:57:01,200
about eradicating uh racially charged

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,559
language in code quit incidentally our

00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,000
next speaker

00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,799
travel

00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,400
building software using the open source

00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,280
development process creates real

00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,760
business value

00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,280
sure but not all the world's problems

00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,440
are business related

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,319
in fact some of the biggest issues we

00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,240
face can't be solved by business alone

00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,079
sometimes we're so excited about what's

00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,359
possible that we forget about

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,839
social responsibility and the

00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,680
repercussions of our actions

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,760
like racially problematic language that

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,480
filters into open source code and i t

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,079
terminology like the implicit bias

00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,680
within ai models

00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,760
where the need to secure personal

00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,680
privacy from surveillance

00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,280
or the global issues such as our carbon

00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,280
footprint and climate change

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,640
or responding to a global pandemic like

00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,640
covet 19.

00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,680
these are all examples where communities

00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,079
can gather

00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,839
and make a difference in fact in

00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,079
response to the current pandemic

00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,880
red hatters really wanted to help so we

00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,200
identified

00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,280
a few specific projects and are

00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,359
encouraging red hatters to work together

00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,839
in these projects to pitch in and help

00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:05,520
open emr and open source electronic

00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,359
medical record system used by health

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,880
providers for scheduling tracking and

00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,200
treating patients

00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,079
covid net an open source neural network

00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,359
used to detect

00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,559
covet 19 from chest x-rays and connected

00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,960
health ida's bringing

00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,880
camel drools kafka and kubeflow together

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,760
into an intelligent data as a service

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,200
platform

00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,440
that enables healthcare providers to

00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,760
make informed decisions

00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,440
and acknowledging this virtual event i'd

00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,520
be remiss not to highlight

00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,200
that we can all do our part to fight

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,960
covet 19 by practicing

00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,200
social distancing and wearing a mask in

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,200
public we're in this together each and

00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,280
every one of us

00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,119
open source communities like these are

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,160
one way we can facilitate global

00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,720
collaboration

00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,440
in order to create impact right now a

00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,000
way any of us can contribute

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,079
we cannot overcome challenges like these

00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,480
without continued broad cooperation

00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,160
across

00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,400
organizations and societies at all

00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,520
levels from technology to policy

00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,640
to individual actions and it's worth

01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,720
noting

01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,400
that technological solutions created in

01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,040
isolation from the parties they may

01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,319
affect will

01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:13,359
typically fall short all right so let me

01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,799
bring this back to open source and i t

01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,640
open source software development is

01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,920
about opening access and removing the

01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,720
barrier between

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,640
ip owners and users it enables

01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,400
engagement between developers and users

01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,280
and empowers communities with freedom

01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,359
with flexibility and choice there's

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,839
creative value in the virtuous cycle of

01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:34,240
user-driven innovation

01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,599
collaboration to solve big challenges is

01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,119
not at all new

01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,799
collaboration drove our industrial

01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,480
revolutions by agreeing to

01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,000
uniform standards of size and

01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,920
measurement for industrial

01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,760
spanning railroads and international

01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,520
communication channels

01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,920
or take the scientific method for

01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,960
example we eradicated diseases like

01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,799
smallpox

01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,240
by enabling the scientific community to

01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:57,760
work together across

01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:59,520
international boundaries open access is

01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,040
crucial when building the software and

01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,720
infrastructure that will help solve

01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,720
today's problems

01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,119
the world needs i t infrastructure that

01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,359
does not constrain cooperation in order

01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,839
to maximize business value

01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:13,599
we must ensure innovators can focus on

01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:15,280
creating solutions

01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:19,280
and worry less about whether supporting

01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,440
technologies allow their experimentation

01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,160
this flexibility and choice is why red

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,839
hat is focused on the open hybrid cloud

01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,920
we're building a platform for this

01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:29,599
essential collaboration

01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,960
now we want our portfolio to be

01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,280
successful obviously

01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,119
but also responsible and at the same

01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,119
time we want to continue our work

01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,720
supporting innovation across the digital

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,480
landscape

01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,920
even if we don't see the value of that

01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,240
innovation immediately

01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,960
or directly it matters to someone

01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,680
somewhere as

01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,760
they scratched that itch and someday we

01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,359
may find it matters to us too in ways

01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,839
we couldn't imagine because our eyes

01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,920
were focused on a different goal

01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,880
after all your memory foam mattress

01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,559
wouldn't exist

01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,440
if nasa didn't need to make pilots

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,359
comfortable on long flights

01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,280
so when it comes to i.t operations we

01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,839
can apply that same approach building a

01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,599
place for information to be shared

01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,880
building the railroad to connect the

01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,640
community

01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,400
sharing the formula that makes up your

01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,400
mattress

01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,319
because the history of operations isn't

01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,960
like that of railroads or communication

01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:21,039
standards

01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,559
or medical and scientific practices it's

01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,760
not all connected it's not a

01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,119
community it's operational knowledge in

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,839
silos

01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,039
divided by industry by individual

01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,839
business practices

01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,400
even among teams in the same

01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:36,160
organization

01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,640
and as open source communities have

01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,400
redefined how software is developed and

01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,400
features are delivered

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,240
we must advance and consider how

01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,839
communities deliver operational

01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,359
excellence along with open source

01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:50,960
software operate first is how we

01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,520
address these divisions and how we'll

01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,599
build an operations community

01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,680
operate first is our effort to

01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,960
encapsulate operational excellence

01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,359
within our platform and

01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,920
in order to enable creativity across our

01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:05,599
broad partner ecosystem

01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,920
operate first is about making

01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,440
operational considerations as much a

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,440
part of what we do

01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,680
as upstream first is for code

01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,960
making operations first our guiding

01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,640
principle in the development of our

01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,960
cloud computing platforms

01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,480
we're doing what we've always done we're

01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,640
connecting with our communities

01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,839
and using the foundations and principles

01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,799
of open source

01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,280
to meet the challenges of today in this

01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,039
way

01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,720
we continue to try to make room for all

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,799
the voices and all the innovation even

01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,119
the ones we're blind to today

01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,079
and we ensure that open source can

01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:42,839
continue

01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:44,720
to unlock the world's potential thank

01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:48,079
you

01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:50,559
thank you chris uh our next speaker is

01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,480
megan birdsenicki she's a manager of

01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,000
research and operations in the google

01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,760
open source program office

01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,440
where she champions open source

01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,920
citizenship within google

01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,119
and the industry at large today she'll

01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,760
share a few words

01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,860
on citizenship during covid welcome

01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,570
megan

01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:10,960
[Applause]

01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:13,440
[Music]

01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,359
thank you that's what google wants to

01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,160
say today

01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,200
covet has impacted open source in all

01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,359
industries

01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,359
and we are so grateful to work with so

01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,240
many of you to make sure open source

01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,000
stays

01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,240
sustainable during this really

01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,760
challenging time

01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,839
of course google has been committed to

01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,400
open source citizenship

01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,440
way before covid and that's because we

01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,920
use over 2

01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,160
000 projects and contribute to them as

01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,160
well

01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,160
we need to make sure these projects

01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,200
remain future-proofed and we do this

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,599
with three main sustainability efforts

01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,960
first we contribute talent whether it's

01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,720
code or tech writers

01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:59,599
design you name it plus we

01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,319
contribute funds directly to projects

01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,559
and we

01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,799
create sustainability programs that we

01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,440
use and also share broadly with the

01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:07,359
industry

01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,680
and we hope you'll check these out such

01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:11,839
as oss fuzz

01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,200
which uncovers security vulnerabilities

01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:16,559
and it's used today by

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,680
250 projects and has already filed 16

01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,640
000 bugs

01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,400
and 30 000 vulnerabilities we also have

01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,440
google summer of code

01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,920
which is a 15 year long program that has

01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,160
brought

01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:32,079
15 000 students to over 680 projects

01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:35,680
and together they have contributed over

01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:37,680
36 million lines of code to open source

01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,760
plus we have our newest program season

01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,880
of docs that brings tech writers

01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,880
into projects and so far they help

01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,160
improve the documentation for 44

01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,240
projects

01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,640
and i hope you'll check these out we

01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,039
really do want to share these resources

01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:55,599
with everyone in the industry especially

01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,520
during this time of covid

01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,640
and that's because so many challenges

01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,359
popped up

01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,640
seemingly overnight first there were

01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,400
financial challenges

01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,240
as events were cancelled or we had to

01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,079
move to virtual events

01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,079
plus there were talent shortages as

01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,240
people had to find new jobs and didn't

01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,720
have time to contribute

01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,960
or they were finding themselves at home

01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,160
providing care for people they love

01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,119
and working at the same time and of

01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,280
course

01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,520
we had to all figure out how to take our

01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,400
communities fully online and understand

01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,680
how to make that

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,039
work such as meetups or conferences like

01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,119
this

01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,079
it hasn't been easy and there's been

01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,640
some pain

01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,880
that came with these challenges but

01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,880
what's really inspired me

01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,119
is how well individuals and

01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,400
organizations came together and started

01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,760
to solve this

01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,599
and they started solving it quickly

01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,799
and i am so proud of the ways that

01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,559
google

01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:55,119
was able to step up and help with

01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,720
everyone else we started to reach out to

01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,520
projects that we use

01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,200
to find out what they're experiencing

01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,559
and seeing how we can help them

01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,720
and it's helped us form stronger

01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,039
relationships that we can build off of

01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,160
now

01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:10,720
into the future plus we pivoted

01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,400
our internship program you just can't

01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,599
have students go into

01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,280
your offices and so we decided to bring

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,520
them into open source

01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,960
and so now a thousand interns are going

01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,319
to work with googlers who are going to

01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,119
mentor them so they

01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:25,520
contribute well and they do it right

01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,599
plus

01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,440
many googlers have been contributing to

01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,079
open source on the front lines

01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,960
with projects like next strain or covet

01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,480
act now

01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:39,599
and schema.org and

01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,240
we also shared everyone share with

01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,119
everyone an

01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,079
online community guide and it's to help

01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,160
you

01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,160
learn how to quickly pivot and have your

01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,760
online events and it comes from all of

01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,359
the tips and tricks that we've learned

01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,359
over the years providing this here at

01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,119
google

01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,880
i'm really honored that we can help in

01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,000
these ways

01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,039
but mostly i'm just so grateful that we

01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,119
can work together

01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,200
to make sure open source remains

01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,000
sustainable because it can only be

01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,640
sustainable

01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,520
if we work together so you can count on

01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,000
google

01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,359
to continue its commitment to

01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,640
citizenship

01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:18,400
now and beyond covid and if you would

01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,560
like to contribute as well

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,759
there's some simple ways to do so and

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,960
you don't need to be

01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:26,880
a large enterprise to make a difference

01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,080
you can go into your project and see

01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,440
which issues you can

01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,080
answer today you can also look for some

01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,799
languishing

01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,279
pull requests and close them out and you

01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,080
can

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,679
do a small donation to a project it can

01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,719
really make a difference

01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:46,080
you might buy some swag or maybe

01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:48,960
you just do a small membership fee

01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,880
and again we really would like to share

01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,000
our open source resources with you and

01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,279
all of our sustainability

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,080
programs so please check them out at

01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:59,359
opensource.google

01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:02,080
and lastly we want to hear

01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,120
new ideas of how we can help open source

01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,040
so please

01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:09,839
share your ideas use today's platform

01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:12,799
and let us know what we can be doing

01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:15,359
we're going to be listening

01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:17,279
so thank you so much for your time and

01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:21,359
especially thank you for contributing to

01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:23,520
open source

01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,679
thank you very much megan we hope to see

01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,679
more

01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:32,000
our next speaker is eddie tajeda he is

01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,319
the director of cloud.gov

01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,359
in the general services administration

01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,239
of the u.s

01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,560
government created by industry experts

01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:41,279
cloud.gov is a response to large-scale

01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,359
technology

01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,040
failures like the initial launch of

01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,880
healthcare.gov

01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,080
today eddie will highlight the impacts

01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,719
of open source software

01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,759
and working in the open to bring high

01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,080
scalability

01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,360
high security and highly compliant

01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,199
solutions to one of the most

01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:03,110
regulated environments in the world

01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:06,189
welcome eddie

01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:06,189
[Music]

01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,040
hi my name is eddie tejeda and i'm the

01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,199
director of cloud.gov

01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,159
we're housed within another office

01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,760
called

01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:17,199
the technology transformation service

01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,560
within gsa

01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:22,960
uh in the federal government

01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,320
so my goal of this presentation is to

01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,159
make the case that path should be

01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,600
defaulted in government

01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,920
i think some of the experiences that i

01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,440
have will show you why i think this

01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,440
might be the case and i hopefully

01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,360
you find it a valuable perspective as

01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,560
well

01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,760
but first i want to give you a brief

01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,760
overview of cloud.gov

01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,679
cloudclub's mission is to make it easy

01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:48,480
for government to access cloud services

01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,360
it's pretty straightforward we're

01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,480
created by

01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:54,159
another office within the gsa

01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,920
called 18f and this is a digital

01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,880
consulting office that works across the

01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,480
federal government

01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,159
to help improve the user experience of

01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:03,280
government services by helping them

01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:04,960
build and buy technology

01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,480
we've had some great projects i

01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:10,080
recommend you all check it out

01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:11,480
at 18f.gsa.gov but some of the ones that

01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,600
you may have heard of are

01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:16,480
usaspending.gov which tracks a lot of

01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:19,440
government spending data and fbi crime

01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:23,760
explorer which looks at

01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:25,360
crime data one of the things that

01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,440
these early teams found themselves

01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,920
running into in these projects was that

01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,840
they failed they ran into the same exact

01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,920
hurdles over and over again

01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,360
first provisioning resources

01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,480
provisioning these cloud services could

01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,560
take weeks

01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,719
and then the ato process which is the

01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,679
gold standard the thing that allows you

01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,159
to move

01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,520
uh to production it means authority to

01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,840
operate

01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,199
that process could take months and most

01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,800
of it is primarily

01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:55,840
because of documentation that you have

01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,840
to build before you launch to production

01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,679
so instead of repeating this process

01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,320
over and over again

01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:03,600
what the team did was implement a

01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,040
version of cloud foundry

01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,520
in-house and they called the cloud.gov

01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,400
this is also there's also this the

01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,520
special sauce

01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,840
called fedramp which is uh

01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,960
something that allows agencies to

01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,360
inherit the secure

01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,320
the security compliance from other cloud

01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,000
providers

01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,199
so i'll get more into that i'll talk

01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,239
more about that in a second because i

01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:27,120
think that that is going to be an

01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,120
important part of this

01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,280
since cloud.gov launched it's worked

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,960
across

01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,600
the federal government at a lot of

01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,360
different agencies so we've been able to

01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,520
have a pretty good view of the federal

01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,199
government

01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,679
and everything we do is open source you

01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:45,920
can go to cloud.gov to learn more

01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,040
or check out our repository on github

01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,719
where you can see

01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,480
all of our source code everything we do

01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,080
happens in the open

01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,520
we love sharing our experiences and our

01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,719
lessons so

01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,239
check it out so this is what i was

01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:02,000
talking about

01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:05,120
this is one of the index pages

01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,679
of a 400 page report that you have to

01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,840
create

01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,280
in order for you to launch to production

01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,159
for a moderate

01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,159
level system

01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,840
and this has to be created for every

01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,440
application that you are going to launch

01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:22,159
to production

01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,880
no matter what some might be shorter

01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:27,600
might be only 200 pages if it's uh

01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,199
if it's a impact if the impact is low

01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,000
but it could be

01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:33,440
many more hundreds of pages if this has

01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,880
there are some serious

01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,880
security risks with launching

01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,199
and what cloud.gov is able to do is say

01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:44,320
out of

01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:45,440
say 325 security controls that must be

01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,040
documented

01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,239
for you to move to production for a

01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:54,480
moderate system we can handle 269

01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:57,840
of those within cloud.gov so your

01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:00,960
documentation process is a lot simpler

01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:03,040
you are responsible for 41 that we could

01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,400
work together on and then 15 or so that

01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,280
you are responsible

01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:09,040
uh as somebody who is as the app

01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,120
developer

01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:15,840
so just in this diagram you can see what

01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,840
it is that cloud.gav provides

01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,080
and you've all probably seen this

01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,480
diagram showing

01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,199
how a platform as a service allows you

01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,199
to

01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:27,120
think and work higher on the stack and

01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,719
not have to worry about

01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,480
all the lower level components of your

01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:32,239
application but this takes on a whole

01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,320
new meaning in the federal government

01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:36,320
where it's not just about the technology

01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,040
that you're managing it's also

01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,400
about the documentation and the ato that

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,800
you need to have in place before you

01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,560
move

01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,719
to production so

01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,800
biggest benefits cloud.gov you can move

01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,640
to production sooner

01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,480
you can provide a consistent developer

01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,440
experience so once you've worked in one

01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,400
agency you can

01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:58,080
work on another agency's project with a

01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:00,080
similar toolkit

01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,159
and small businesses love the platform

01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,840
because small businesses don't like

01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,280
to do a lot of this documentation this

01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,239
is not where their value

01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,520
lies in many ways it's what excludes a

01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,159
lot of businesses from being able to

01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,920
participate

01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,920
and work with the federal government

01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,080
so as the public cloud becomes much more

01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:22,239
sophisticated

01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:22,239
it's becoming a lot more complex as well

01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,600
one thing that we know about complexity

01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,440
and choice

01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,800
is that it can be overwhelming now this

01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,159
has been studied from a lot of different

01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,520
perspectives

01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,520
in psychology there's this idea of

01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,199
paradox of choice about how people are

01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,480
less satisfied with individual choices

01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,360
that they make the more choices that

01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,880
they have

01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,719
behavioral economics the people

01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,239
overwhelmed by choices and don't often

01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:43,199
make the best decisions for themselves

01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:45,199
and we need to

01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:47,600
nudge them to make sure that they for

01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:49,280
example enroll in the retirement plan

01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,520
and even in software development we have

01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:54,719
seen the rise of conventional

01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:57,120
convention over configuration which um

01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,159
especially in the early 2000s where

01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,199
there was a focus

01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:03,360
on uh having best practices

01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:05,280
baked into the platform as opposed to a

01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,400
lot of xml files which

01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,480
we we all had to edit

01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,880
so this is where platform as a service

01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,800
comes back into the conversation

01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,600
you know kelsey hightower which i

01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,520
suspect most people here know

01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,679
has been talking about this recently you

01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:24,239
know he he recently tweeted

01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,199
just a couple of weeks ago that there's

01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:27,120
a ton of effort

01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,800
attempting to modernize application of

01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,760
an application at the infrastructure

01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,840
layer

01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,960
but there isn't equal investment at the

01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,280
application layer

01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,960
and thinks that frameworks and

01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,239
application servers

01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,920
there needs to be a lot more focus on

01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:42,560
them otherwise we're only solving half

01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,560
of the problem

01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,760
and in government we're already seeing

01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,480
increased interest in paths

01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,800
we've had a number of folks reach out to

01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,560
us

01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,640
who said you know we've built these

01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,199
complex tools these complex systems

01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:59,040
serve our homegrown environments but we

01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,960
are willing to give up control

01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,840
for simplicity it's becoming too hard

01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,840
for us to manage

01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,320
and right now we're at a really

01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:11,360
interesting phase

01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:13,600
where um orchestration tools uh

01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,719
like kubernetes are everywhere this is

01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,239
this is part of

01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,080
the shift and part of the power that

01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:20,719
allowed people to access a lot of these

01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,719
different tools

01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,280
but i think that that's not the whole

01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,360
picture we need to start thinking

01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,719
also about the experience of developers

01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,280
and this is where

01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,040
cloud project kicks in we can replace we

01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:38,640
can start thinking more about

01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:40,560
uh kubernetes and and

01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,400
different components of the developer

01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,679
experience to be in the background

01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:47,280
they don't have to be something that

01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:47,280
developers interacting with every day

01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:55,679
and we can provide government employees

01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,520
and contractors a consistent developer

01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,960
experiences while the back end

01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,360
a lot of that technology in the back end

01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,880
can change

01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,880
and this is massive in government

01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,440
we can build we can have automated

01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:13,840
security compliance requirements

01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,840
built in directly into the stack

01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,440
agencies will be able to attract new

01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,199
businesses will be able to build

01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:26,080
on an existing infrastructure that they

01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:27,679
can trust and become familiar with we

01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,080
also can leave space for

01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,760
some projects that do need to squeeze

01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,480
out every last value out of the

01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,480
infrastructure

01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,960
but in the future if we're going to

01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,080
continue to invest in cloud

01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,600
especially in the federal government

01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,719
where we're just getting started when

01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,320
you start thinking about the next

01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,000
generation of developers

01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,320
that are going to be maintaining these

01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,320
tools

01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:54,080
we love sharing our experiences with

01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,159
agencies and other businesses

01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:58,480
if you're interested in learning more

01:18:56,159 --> 01:19:00,800
feel free to reach out

01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,800
thank you

01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,640
thanks eddie uh our final speaker today

01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,360
is

01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,320
also going to touch on the effect of

01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:13,199
coronavirus

01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,000
and how it's impacted us all grace

01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:16,080
francisco

01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,600
is vice president of worldwide developer

01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:21,600
relations and education

01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,880
at mongodb and has for over two decades

01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,320
i've been working

01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:28,159
as a leader in worldwide developer

01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,600
initiatives at companies such as

01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:32,480
microsoft intuit

01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,199
yodlee atlassian and roblox today she

01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,440
will talk about

01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,560
community and belonging in the time of

01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,700
coronavirus

01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:41,850
welcome grace

01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:43,840
[Applause]

01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:45,920
[Music]

01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,679
good morning good afternoon and good

01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,719
evening to all of you wherever you may

01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:52,640
be dialed in for this event

01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:56,080
my name is grace francisco i'm the head

01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:58,960
of developer relations for mongodb

01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:00,960
and i've had the great wealth privilege

01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,239
of being in developer relations for over

01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,159
16 years

01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:06,719
across a variety of different companies

01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:09,440
both large and small

01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,960
i recently also joined the board of the

01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,040
drupal association

01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,280
which was a great honor for me having

01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,040
worked with the drupal community

01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,840
well over a decade ago while i was still

01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,840
at microsoft

01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,280
it goes without saying that we are

01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,560
living under

01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,840
extraordinary times today and while

01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,320
we've been sheltered in place for

01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,320
several months now here in my area

01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,639
i've been thinking a lot about this book

01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,719
i read many many years ago

01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:38,719
love in the time of cholera by gabriella

01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:41,520
garcia marquez for which

01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,400
i had the inspiration for the title of

01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,520
my own talk

01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:47,840
today cholera was actually a pandemic

01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,639
as well and there are seven incidences

01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,320
of cholera

01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:54,560
over the course of 150 plus years

01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,400
and in this book largely on the surface

01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,120
it's about this romance between these

01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,600
two people

01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,600
over the course of 50 years where in

01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:05,120
that 50-year time frame

01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:08,960
they were separated by time space

01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:10,719
marriage cholera and war

01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,320
and while i've been thinking about this

01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:13,199
in developer relations during this

01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,120
pandemic

01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:17,120
i think about the fact that i certainly

01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,760
hope that it doesn't take us 50 plus

01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,440
years

01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,679
for us to have meaningful connections

01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:25,360
again with developers as we do

01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:27,440
our work another thing that comes to

01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,520
mind for me frequently as i get up is

01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:32,080
that i've woken up into some

01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,760
wacky episode of the twilight zone and

01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,239
so very appropriately the washington

01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,320
post

01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:38,080
had written this article about seven

01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,880
specific episodes that seemed so

01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,000
appropriate

01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:44,880
for this particular time and

01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,280
interestingly the pilot episode of the

01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:49,920
twilight zone itself which was entitled

01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,880
where is everybody is very appropriate

01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,480
for today

01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:56,719
it opens up with this air force officer

01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,679
who wakes up not knowing who he is where

01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,000
he is

01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:01,440
and he wanders about this empty town

01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,719
looking looking for

01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,719
someone anyone and as his panic

01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:09,920
escalates as he's not finding

01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,400
people but finding signs of life he runs

01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,800
out

01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,440
into the open space into the town square

01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,360
screaming

01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,800
where is everybody and he's been trying

01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,639
to wake himself up saying

01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,000
it's time to wake up it's time to wake

01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:21,920
up and

01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,520
you know this is very relevant to me

01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,840
right now as we live through this

01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,840
pandemic

01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:31,840
and the virus has really significantly

01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:34,639
changed the way we internet

01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,920
as many of us are seeking to connect

01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,800
virtually across

01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,840
social networks like facebook or to

01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,679
really forget

01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,679
about this experience for brief moments

01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:45,840
by entertaining ourselves

01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,440
and not surprisingly we're not on the go

01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,920
right now so mobile app usage has

01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:52,480
plummeted

01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,440
and in this period where we've all been

01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,080
sheltered in place

01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,880
many of us are seeking minute by minute

01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,880
updates

01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,320
on the news and so news channels have

01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,600
gone up significantly

01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:04,960
in traffic as we sit and ponder what's

01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,800
going on in the world

01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,639
what the latest updates are about the

01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,320
coronavirus about what's going on with

01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,600
the riots and protests

01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:17,199
and really thinking where is everybody

01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:19,120
where is everybody is everybody okay

01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:20,239
and i will tell you where everybody is

01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,520
right now they're all

01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:24,320
here in muppet land on zoom trying to

01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,360
connect

01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,000
on things like even google duo and house

01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,239
party

01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,239
these social networks that were really

01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:34,639
not being used much until recently

01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,840
during this pandemic we're all striving

01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:39,440
to reconnect

01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:42,560
to still have that social fabric and yet

01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:45,520
is this really how we want to connect

01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,159
well no it's more like this being a

01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,040
little bit more

01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:51,120
personal with someone one-on-one except

01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,760
that you try to do this over zoom

01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:55,520
and kermi is actually looking off into

01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,159
some other part of the screen

01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,480
and so his eyes aren't looking at you he

01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:02,480
thinks he's looking at you but he's not

01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:04,480
and you have the same experience so you

01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,159
actually miss the true connection

01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,679
and it becomes exhausting to actually

01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:10,000
try to interrelate

01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,679
and to feel that connection when you're

01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,600
not actually having that

01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,600
face-to-face eye-to-eye connection

01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:21,600
and we are all over taxing

01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,920
our home internet as many of you know

01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,719
and

01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,320
we are in these zooms or whatever a

01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,719
video platform that you're on

01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,679
and we often hiccup our way through

01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,320
internet space

01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:34,239
and we leave our meetings frozen like

01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:37,040
this as our internet hiccups

01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:39,040
and freezes us in time and often have

01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,600
this expression like han solo being

01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,000
frozen

01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,080
in carbonite and this this is the

01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,080
impression that we leave our colleagues

01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,600
as we drop out suddenly from that

01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,199
meeting

01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,520
well i don't know about you guys but

01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:53,440
that's exhausting so sometimes i just

01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,080
have to take a break from that virtual

01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,199
space

01:24:54,080 --> 01:25:00,159
and be out in the real world and so

01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:01,280
i go out on this walk to contemplate the

01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,600
meaning of life

01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,679
and how to belong in this world where we

01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,000
have to have social distancing

01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:10,080
and i walk these deserted streets

01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,880
thinking about how to belong

01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,600
when you can't really be there in person

01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,480
how

01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,760
do we belong and have meaning and so i

01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:21,120
take these long walks

01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:23,520
and i contemplate contemplate

01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,360
then i get home with my furry pets who

01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,639
are absolutely exhausted with my

01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,480
multiple walks a day

01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,560
contemplating the meaning of life and

01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,600
how to belong and how to relate in this

01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,239
virtual space

01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:36,080
of ours and really these poor pops are

01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:37,760
reflecting the absolute sheer exhaustion

01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,440
we're all facing right now

01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,400
and trying to make this work in this

01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,400
virtual format

01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:48,480
some of us have really been leaning into

01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,159
learning as we've been sheltered in

01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:53,760
place and

01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:55,600
interestingly these massive open online

01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:58,719
courses that were declining

01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,719
have seen seven times the traffic during

01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,360
the pandemic than they have in previous

01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:05,360
periods and so people are reskilling

01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,320
learning new programming languages new

01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,159
frameworks

01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,600
new technology disciplines like data

01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:12,719
science

01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,920
in their time sheltered in place which

01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,719
is great

01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,520
interestingly though the most popular

01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:19,600
course

01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,440
the breakout hit during the pandemic is

01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:25,360
really about the science

01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:27,040
of well-being and not surprisingly

01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,880
it's about well-being because we're all

01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,440
struggling to keep our sanity during

01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,560
this

01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,040
pandemic this really crazy twilight zone

01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,560
era

01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:38,800
of ours that we're experiencing together

01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,679
evans data published this report a while

01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:45,120
ago forecasting that by the end of 2019

01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:48,800
we would have well over 24 million

01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:50,639
developers through the end of 2019

01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,960
and these are global professional

01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,760
developers i expect that this forecast

01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,760
is going to be

01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:58,719
changed quite a bit in the coming years

01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,639
in terms of the volume of growth given

01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,400
all this new learning and people really

01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,320
leaning into reskilling

01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,960
and we are very fortunate in tech to

01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:08,639
have work that can be easily done

01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,880
from home and so people are going to be

01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,960
looking to these kinds of

01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,639
workloads and jobs that can be done from

01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,120
home as this pandemic is going to be

01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:18,560
here

01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,840
for quite some time and we're seeing

01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,880
massive shifts

01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:25,920
in the biggest developer conferences

01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:28,159
either canceling or virtualizing

01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,120
or postponing in hopes for that

01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:32,960
in-person

01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:34,719
experience again

01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,120
and now we get to this picture of fish

01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:39,120
why am i showing you pictures of fish

01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,800
and this is the part where it's where

01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,480
i'm a broken record with my developer

01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,960
relations team about the fact that we

01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,159
can't

01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:48,480
possibly meet 24 million developers all

01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:49,679
in person anyway this is discussion we

01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,000
were having well before

01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:53,280
the pandemic hit and so the team has

01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,400
been well positioned

01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:58,639
to really lean in more into their online

01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,639
component and workload

01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:03,920
because we're always talking about

01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:06,719
scaling scaling scaling

01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:08,560
but the truth of it is many of us really

01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,719
miss being on planes

01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:12,080
traveling to that next destination to

01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:14,880
meet developers

01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,679
in person because honestly nothing

01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,480
replaces

01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,199
this experience of being on the stage

01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,360
being there

01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:23,600
seeing all of you speaking with all of

01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:28,880
you feeling the energy and the vibe

01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:30,960
of the community this we miss a ton

01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,719
and in thinking about this and

01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,520
reflecting about this new virtualized

01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:36,080
format

01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:37,040
i remember this question i had from an

01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,040
open source

01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,080
attendee at a conference i spoke at many

01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,159
years ago

01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:44,320
and he came to me after my talk and he

01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:46,239
said are you relating yet

01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:48,159
and i was completely perplexed and i

01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:50,719
thought am i relating it

01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:51,360
oh he's referring to the fact that my

01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,880
title has

01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:57,600
developer relations in it

01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,719
and so i asked this question to myself a

01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,800
lot right now

01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:02,480
am i relating it are people relating

01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,000
that because these this virtualized

01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,719
format is so hard

01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,800
to do that and to be honest there's no

01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,719
silver bullet there's no magic formula

01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,120
to this right now we're all learning as

01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:13,120
we go

01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,960
because really in this muppet land that

01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,440
we're in right now

01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,120
this is as close as we're going to get

01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:23,199
to how do we belong

01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,960
when we are this far apart and this is

01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,600
as close as we're going to get for some

01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,639
time

01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,639
during this pandemic

01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:32,960
some of us are really leaning into our

01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:36,400
technical skills

01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,679
and using that for good by leading into

01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,000
the things that are so important to us

01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,360
like

01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,360
saving our oceans

01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,120
and for some they're really leaning in

01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:46,639
with their technical skills in creating

01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:49,840
net new solutions

01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:52,320
in the battle for proven 19

01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,280
such as this employee driven initiative

01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,880
employees across

01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:57,520
mongodb apple alphabet and amazon got

01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,280
together

01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,199
to build this solution in partnership

01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:04,320
with boston children's hospital

01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:05,440
and harvard medical research to build a

01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,440
solution which

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,679
people could opt in to help with data

01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:13,040
tracking around coveted incidences

01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:13,040
across the united states

01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,520
and in the drupal community the drupal

01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,679
association is at the heart

01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,000
and core of what keeps the community

01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:24,639
going and alive and connected

01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,520
and as the drupal association has a high

01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:28,480
dependency on

01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,120
in-person events the community really

01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,440
rallied

01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,239
together to keep the dribble association

01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,040
afloat

01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:37,280
and we were able to raise enough funding

01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:40,320
to keep drupal association alive

01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:43,440
because of 150 businesses

01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:44,400
and 2 000 indep individual members who

01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,719
contributed

01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:48,239
to the drupal association and that's

01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,480
important right now because

01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:51,760
there are many many organizations who

01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,920
really depend

01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,760
on drupal who are right now in the front

01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,560
lines of this battle that we have with

01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,560
covet 19.

01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,080
and when it comes to belonging at

01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,560
mongodb our premier

01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,639
developer event mongodb world is where

01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,719
we really strive to get to

01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:10,800
and really look forward to meeting with

01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:13,440
our community and our developers

01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,880
well that too had to become virtualized

01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:18,320
and we had that recently

01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,760
and became mongodb live we decided in

01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:22,400
this to really lean into

01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,040
the reality of our experience today and

01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,080
that

01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:27,679
we used to our to our event and our

01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,400
keynote speakers were all

01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,400
in this zoom-like gallery experience as

01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:34,159
part of the keynote experience

01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,679
really reflecting what life is like

01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:38,080
today

01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:39,360
and we even enlisted the help of one of

01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:42,080
our keynote speakers

01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:44,400
children to help close out the keynote

01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:47,120
with our own custom-made

01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,120
exit note

01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:52,639
some of the most creative solutions

01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,239
come from community members such as the

01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:56,480
devops community here

01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:57,679
where austin actually used his favorite

01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:00,880
gaming platform

01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:03,120
to create a virtual trade show booth

01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,239
and it was done in jest but someone else

01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,280
in the community and said

01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:08,560
well hey we should actually do that

01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:12,400
conference that we're going to

01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:14,320
cancel in animal crossings

01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,239
well guess what they did make that

01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,840
happen and

01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:19,679
one of our own developer advocates

01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:22,719
adrian actually presented

01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,679
her full presentation as herself and in

01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,840
her avatar

01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:27,120
there were other people in this virtual

01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,480
classroom of hers

01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:31,600
learning from her in this new

01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,600
virtualized format

01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:38,159
and to boot of course she had mongodb

01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:40,320
swag to share and when i think about

01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:42,560
gaming my own experiences with gaming

01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:44,320
how appropriate gaming really knows how

01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,480
to scale and what a great

01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:50,320
opportunity to keep the conference going

01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,320
in even in this virtualized format

01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:57,840
so back to han solo being frozen

01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,239
in time and carbonite and i feel this

01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,040
way

01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:02,800
right now during this pandemic that

01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:05,679
we're all sort of frozen

01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,400
waiting waiting waiting for things to be

01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:09,600
normal

01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:12,480
again but the reality is that

01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,040
that normal we're going into a new

01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:16,320
normal

01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:19,760
of things and so we can't keep being

01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,760
frozen in time like this

01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:26,159
we can be together while we are this far

01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:26,159
apart

01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:33,520
in fact we are so uniquely positioned

01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:34,719
to do really great things in this broken

01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,360
world of ours

01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:38,719
we have valuable technical skills that

01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:41,120
we can contribute

01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:43,679
to really make meaningful impact during

01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,679
this time

01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,520
so whether it's really leaning in with

01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,800
our technical skills

01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:54,320
to battle this issue of coven 19

01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:57,520
all around us all around the world

01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:59,199
or helping with this battle on racial

01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:03,520
injustices that happen

01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:06,560
to black americans every single day

01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,560
in america

01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,000
or whether it's to help our open source

01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:13,120
communities

01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,000
continue to thrive in the face of all of

01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,679
this that we

01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,679
are experiencing right now because they

01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:19,280
too are also on their front lines their

01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:22,480
users are in their front lines

01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:26,719
battling kobit 19 or helping with social

01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,719
injustice and and writing those things

01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:33,120
so i ask you to think about if you're

01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:35,679
done with just learning

01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:38,480
if you are done with just binge watching

01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:40,480
all the things

01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:42,239
and you're done with being exhausted

01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:46,080
with all those contemplative walks with

01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:48,560
your furry friends

01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,400
are you relating to any of this yet does

01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:53,280
this mean something to you

01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,280
i hope it does

01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,360
because all of us as humans have a deep

01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:00,320
desire

01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,800
and need to belong and i know it's hard

01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,480
right now

01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:06,719
in these virtualized formats and i know

01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,719
it's hard being socially distanced

01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:11,760
but really together especially in tech

01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:15,040
especially with all of us who can code

01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:18,159
and do things for good

01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:21,119
you ask yourselves where is everybody

01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:23,199
where is everybody we are all still here

01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:25,360
our communities are still here

01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:27,440
and they still need you to make a

01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:30,960
difference the world needs you

01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:33,199
more than ever before so i i ask you

01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,199
find your belonging in your communities

01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:40,560
again because we're all here

01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:40,560
and we're all here together thank you

01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:46,080
thank you grace what a perfect note to
