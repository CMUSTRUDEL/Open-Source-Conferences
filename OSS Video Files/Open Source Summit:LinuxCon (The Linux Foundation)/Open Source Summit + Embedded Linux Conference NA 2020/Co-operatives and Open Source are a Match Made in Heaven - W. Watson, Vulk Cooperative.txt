good afternoon

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
welcome to the cooperative and open

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,280
source

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,240
uh talk a match made in heaven my name

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,480
is watson

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,519
i'm one of the founders of the volk

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
cooperative in

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,680
austin texas as well as the austin

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,960
software cooperative

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,080
meetup group as a cooperative that has

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
contributed to

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,439
open source i'd like to share some of

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,840
the synergies

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,840
i found between these two communities

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,000
so uh today well we're going to

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,079
explore the concept of a cooperative and

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,120
its motivations as well

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,160
as the motivations for open source

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,920
open source itself will try to

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,079
answer the question of whether a

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,280
cooperative is a good business entity

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,280
uh for developing open source software

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,199
so what is a cooperative the term

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
cooperative

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,040
covers a broad range of enterprises

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
there are cooperatives based on

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,520
purchasing selling labor and ownership

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
we're going to be concentrating on

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,520
cooperatives that are worker owned and

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
worker directed

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,799
in order to tease out the synergies

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,520
between cooperatives and

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,080
open source we should investigate some

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,280
common

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,360
motivators to these communities

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,159
borrowing from daniel pink's book drive

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,759
we could categorize the motivators as

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,280
monetary autonomy mastery

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,479
and purpose monetary is simply the

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,960
acquisition of money or liquid acids

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,240
autonomy is the ability to choose one's

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,680
own tasks and

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,119
pathways mastery is about craftsmanship

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,680
or being a craftsmen are

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,560
i should say artisanship and being an

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,439
artisan and one's a field and purpose

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,439
is about making a positive damp in the

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
world

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,200
feel free to uh send any questions

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,879
into the uh chat and then i'll

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,840
stop and try to answer them i'm gonna

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,840
try to go pretty quick here

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,800
there are several shared themes between

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,440
open source and cooperatives both

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
try to decentralize power which is to

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,920
say

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,440
both try to flatten the intrinsic

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,800
hierarchies

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,319
albeit using different strategies

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,760
both have unique and strong views for

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,120
their type of

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,720
governance open source has a strong

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,680
history of developing

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,959
a community of contributors while trying

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
to be inclusive

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
of the community that is external to its

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,800
contributors

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,159
um cooperatives have a history of devel

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,519
uh developing

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,640
and internal non-exploitative uh culture

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
of owners

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,360
and then an external community that it

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,720
used that uses its services

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
both open source and cooperative are

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,400
concerned with fair compensation

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
approach the problem in uh different

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
ways

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,040
and lastly both uh open source and

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,080
cooperatives tend to

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,879
consider ethical implications of

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,840
the project products and services uh

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,840
that they provide

00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,720
[Music]

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,440
decentralization of power so

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,280
the first shared theme uh is

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,840
decentralization

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,879
uh both uh open source and cooperatives

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,920
attempt to

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,920
decentralize power the motivator for

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,439
this shared theme is a drive

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,200
for autonomy decentralization is about

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,560
distributing the work that is done

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,000
to a wide base for open source

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,040
decentralization

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,760
can be facilitated by decentralizing

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,280
leadership structures but sometimes this

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,840
isn't the case

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,440
uh the biggest driver for

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,079
decentralization in an open source

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,280
project

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
is the organic development of a diverse

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,120
contributor

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,400
base any open source project can be

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,280
forked

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,919
which incentivizes the original

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,440
project's

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:39,759
leadership to be

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,880
more liberal in accepting the best ideas

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,919
as contributions um so for um

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,560
cooperatives uh decentralization comes

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,720
in the form of a worker owned um of the

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,320
worker-owned aspect of the

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,960
entity the the steering power and

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,080
direction in a cooperative is dispersed

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,880
through the group via

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,720
the one worker um one vote principle

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,039
each worker has much more say in

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
what they are working on compared to a

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,919
traditional entity

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,400
because they're an owner in the

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,400
cooperative

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,759
democratic let's see here

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,600
so democrat and governance or democratic

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,680
governance

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,720
again if you have any questions i'm feel

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,800
free to

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,440
post them and i'll take a look at them

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,639
democratic governance is another shared

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,199
theme

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,199
between open source and cooperatives uh

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,720
it is again motivated by the desire

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,880
for autonomy uh

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
while decentralization spreads the

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,280
actual tasks

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,560
uh into a wider area

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,840
um governance is about deciding

00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,160
which tasks to be prioritized

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,639
while decentralization in open source is

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
attractive

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,080
because community members can avoid

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,479
coordination with a hierarchy when

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,360
performing individual tasks

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,680
democratic governance is what provides a

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,960
method for influencing the overall

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,639
project general bacon

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,560
in the art of community states that

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,680
there are three types of governance

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,600
uh struct structures within open source

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
the benevolent dictator the enlightened

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
dictatorship

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,039
and delegated governance

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,319
enlightened dictatorship is based on the

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,520
idea that people gain

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,720
influence with it by becoming thought

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,919
leaders

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:46,080
and through doing useful uh work

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:49,680
whereas uh delegated governance

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,520
has power delegated to small groups

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,199
and those small groups come together to

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,560
form a single governing body

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,560
so these latter two forms of

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,160
of governance share the same spirit

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,880
of uh worker participation in governance

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,880
to a great degree with cooperatives

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,560
and so that's where they uh are similar

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,599
so within um worker

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,599
owned cooperatives

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,240
uh that have a uh one worker one uh

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,120
vote mandate the workers can legally

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,160
vote

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,360
the leadership into their roles in

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,280
worker owned worker directed

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,479
cooperatives the workers decide where to

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,919
invest or spend

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,039
the surplus or profit democratically and

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,160
we're going to talk a little bit more

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,440
about that

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,520
later in all forms of

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,360
cooperatives the workers have a high

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,039
degree of participation

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,000
in how they are governed but the most

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,360
democratic type of cooperative is the

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,400
worker owned

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,800
and worker-directed cooperative

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,080
so i think we have a couple of questions

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,599
here

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,479
i'm going to go ahead and try to take a

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,479
look at some of these

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,240
uh let's see here i'm gonna go ahead and

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,759
see if we'll

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,759
try this to show

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,400
this question all right

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
so david klein i love this concept thank

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,759
you for presenting i have uh have you

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,599
spent any time thinking about a buyer's

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
co-op model

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,800
and how would you uh how would it work

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,240
with open source so

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,880
um a buyer's co-op where

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,159
people are coming together in order to

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,279
purchase

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,120
i think that's a purchasing co-op

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,320
so i'm not so sure maybe a little

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,279
clarification there

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,160
and i don't know how that would maybe

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,080
work

00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,519
um i'm sorry with open source

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,040
uh but a buyer co-op

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,399
or purchasing co-op where

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,399
you come together and purchase

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,800
health insurance or something like that

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,800
those are pretty common and they seem to

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,839
be a good idea

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,800
uh with all of these examples

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,360
or some there's plenty of examples

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
within

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,240
uh for cooperatives of just about

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,440
anything that you can imagine

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,920
uh but in spiral is one of

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,680
my favorites and they're they're

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,320
basically a cooperative of cooperatives

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,640
you might want to look at them as far as

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
probably seeing

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,320
if they have something that might be a

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:52,560
purchasing cooperative

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
and we're going to go ahead and answer

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,839
another question

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,600
here so we got

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,200
taylor carpenter are there any examples

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
of open source projects using delegated

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,839
governance

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:09,279
so the example that general uh bacon

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,959
uses for delegated governance

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,640
um i wanna say

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:20,399
well there's apache maybe

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,920
and um the cncf the cloud native

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,920
uh foundation would be one

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,959
right so small groups coming together to

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,399
form a single

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,880
unifying body the higher end or the

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,680
upper

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,399
end it's kind of more strategic and but

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,480
and they

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,760
they don't get into the individual like

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
the operational

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,040
day-to-day uh decisions those are left

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,480
to the individual groups

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,839
um so that's kind of where the delegated

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,640
governance comes to and

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,519
i i want to say general uh bacon who's i

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,200
want to say

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,839
he spoke earlier uh today

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,240
uh he favors the delegated governance

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,040
style

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,040
let's see here

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,160
we're gonna take a question from angie

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
this talk is more interesting than uh

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,560
than i thought

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,959
can you provide a real world example and

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,079
mention a case study so

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,399
um i'm going to mention a case study at

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,839
the

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
at the end so um it's going to be a good

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,160
one

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,160
so let's see who else

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,720
okay that's good

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,240
all right

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,240
let's go on to

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
talk about communities

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,839
all right

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
okay so

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,839
both uh open source and

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,360
uh cooperatives are deeply intertwined

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,399
uh with their communities

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,279
a big motivation for open source

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,120
um contributors is the development and

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,160
showcasing

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,959
of the mastery of one's craft

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,000
uh this gives social capital to the

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,680
individual

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
contributor within the context of the

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,399
community for many

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,200
cooperatives building the community is

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,160
the

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
business strategy which leans towards

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,160
the

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,519
greater purpose as the motivation

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,680
on going back to the different styles or

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
categories of motivation for these

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,560
cooperatives where purpose

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,639
is their motivation a feedback loop in

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,320
the form of serving the immediate

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,839
local community uh with their products

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,839
uh and services is the it ends up being

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,959
the best way to attract new members to

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,920
develop those

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,959
uh projects uh products and services so

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
ends up being

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,600
a kind of a bootstrapping right so the

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,639
where the business

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,399
the community is the business strategy

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,959
on that so um that's kind of interesting

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,600
you might

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,560
again try to take a look at spiral for a

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,560
good example of that

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,200
so let's talk a little bit about

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,200
compensation

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,120
here um

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,120
so monetary compensation is the um

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
traditional way uh to think of

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,160
motivation for

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:48,079
economists and and the general public

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:52,160
um both open source and cooperatives

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,560
uh have a non-uh traditional

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,440
or conventional approach to um

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,639
compensation

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,399
uh and as mentioned before open source

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,760
is uh largely driven by social capital

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,920
but that social capital can indirectly

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:13,519
have monetary gain in the form of

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,800
building a strong signal for confidence

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,600
in one's craft

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,279
so this serves as a kind of ideal resume

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,160
for the contributors

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,920
uh to an open source project uh

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,079
cooperatives can sell products

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,600
and services as a normal a business

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,839
would

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,680
at the group level right so the higher

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,440
level but at the individual level the

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,079
compensation schemes can be similar to

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
those

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,519
that you would find in a business that

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,120
runs as a partnership

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,360
and this is kind of really important to

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,800
understand about a cooperative you

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,399
really to understand

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,199
when people are confused about a

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,720
cooperative i always just say

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,839
think about a law firm they they run as

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,160
partnerships and it's always it's

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,440
interesting

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,720
that the people that understand law they

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,279
opt to

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,360
form an entity that's a partnership

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,480
whereas people that don't understand

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,680
law and fairness and things like that

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,959
they don't they they're um happy to just

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,079
consent to

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:21,600
uh a a hierarchy and a a

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:25,120
corporate structure so i find that to be

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,079
tremendously um interesting right so

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,480
within a um

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,839
a cooperative some way of working out

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,320
fair compensation

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:37,920
uh must occur in an entity that has uh

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,199
one member and one vote so it kind of

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,639
serves as a um

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:48,480
that's kind of like a a a

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:52,079
a barrier to stop unfair

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,920
unfairness uh in equitabilities and

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,920
things like that so for instance um

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,519
corporations the typical corporations

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,880
have a

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:06,839
ratio of um executive

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,959
to worker compensation that's like

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,959
278 to one

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,720
whereas a partnership style so uh

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,320
cooperatives

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,440
are everyone's an owner so they're kind

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,360
of like a partnership style

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,440
those operate anywhere between

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,720
four between four and ten to one

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,759
so just that alone

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,320
kind of gives more of a

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:41,920
equitable um compensation scheme

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
without even getting too advanced

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,720
so that there's plenty of

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,480
there's lots of information on

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,639
compensation schemes and i just really

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,360
that's one of my favorite

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,279
uh topics when it comes to um

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
cooperatives and fairness and things

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,399
like that

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,480
we um and i'm gonna have a bunch of

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,799
links later um

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,120
where you can see more papers and stuff

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,120
on that

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,760
[Music]

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,760
so now we're getting to ethics

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,559
so um within both open source and

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,079
cooperatives

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:27,520
uh the ethics have to

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,240
in my opinion they have to do uh with

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,360
you can kind of categorize them as

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,200
mitigation of

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,200
exploitation and

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,000
exploitation is an interesting subject

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,679
to try to have people define on

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,360
one extreme you could say something

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,360
along the lines of exploitation is

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,799
um stealing or something like that

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,799
something illegal

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:02,400
whereas on the other extreme

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,679
um what you'll find is people say

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,559
uh they'll kind of lean on

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,880
consent and say um if you consented

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,320
there's no way that you got exploited

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,120
so even indentured servitude which is a

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,840
consent

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,880
people used to be able to say or people

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,160
used to

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,039
um which is illegal now be able to say

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,760
within feudalism and so on and so forth

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,160
i will

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,520
uh commit myself to you pledge myself to

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,919
you for five years

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,919
and you know essentially be your slave

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,120
and um that's consent but yet

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,400
um you know

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:49,039
it's to me that's an exploitation

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:52,640
uh so if you were to

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:55,520
um talk about exploitation

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,400
what i think the a good definition to

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,360
try to

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,480
do a middle road is exploitation happens

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,360
when

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,280
someone creates a product or service but

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,559
doesn't have

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,679
any say in the surplus or

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,559
profit of that product or service so to

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,840
make it simple

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,000
an example would be if you had

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,600
um if you made a if you contributed to

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,400
making a widget

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,080
and let's just say your wages and

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,520
everyone else's wages the creating

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,520
widget was six dollars

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,200
and the widget was sold for for ten

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,559
dollars

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,760
that four dollars that's the profit that

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,640
that it was sold for that four dollars

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,919
is the surplus right if you don't have

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,200
any say on that

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,960
surplus then that's an expert that's a

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,919
definition of exploitation that's one

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,559
definition

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,039
but i would challenge it's very really

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,320
important to think about a reason about

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:57,600
um what

00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,720
exploitation is and if

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,960
if you don't use that uh definition

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,120
because i find it to be ambiguous

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,720
oftentimes

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,520
all right so um so talking about

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,080
some of how uh some of the ways that

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,080
open source

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,400
tries to address exploitation i actually

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,600
think upward source

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,400
mitigates exploitation because its

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,039
licensing

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,520
ensures that the the code is a non-rival

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,520
good

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,640
right a non-rival good really means just

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,480
that no one

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,799
is excluded uh when the good is consumed

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,840
right so you you use open source simply

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,799
and um it is obviously it doesn't stop

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,440
someone else

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,440
from using it right and um

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,600
that it's a small mitigation of

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,000
exploitation

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,480
um as far as the contributors vote so if

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,400
you're a contributor open source

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,039
and you um you want to use

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,799
let's your contributor to some software

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,159
and you want to use that software if

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,640
it's open source

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,799
let's just say it's a dual licensing

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,000
situation or whatever

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,960
um you can you can go and at least use

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
it

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,720
in another scenario

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,440
and um say that you worked on it and so

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,320
on and so forth and actually use it

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,360
and um it ends up working

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,600
whereas um like say a closed source

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,679
it you get exploited in some way so

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,640
as far as cooperatives cooperatives are

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,400
kind of built for

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,840
dealing with um exploitation they

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,559
mitigate exploitation because the

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,720
workers

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,240
actually literally vote on how the

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,159
surplus is used

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,000
right so all the owners get together and

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,600
say oh we sold

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,440
the widget for ten dollars it's a four

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,480
dollar profit

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,799
we're going to say we're going to

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,200
reinvest in the company

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,080
or we're going to give everyone a raise

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,200
whatever

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,840
right so that's kind of kind of the

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,840
argument there

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,760
so all right so some final thoughts

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,440
right

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,640
um open source emerged

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,760
originally from the desire to

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,039
share ideas among early computer

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,840
scientists and

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:28,000
practitioners but it did not

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:32,720
inherently address

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
exploitation of its contributors right

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,720
we have kind of a bunch of different

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,760
um situations dual licensing open core

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:48,960
things like that where the contributors

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,480
they don't get a say on where the

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,280
surplus goes

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,640
cooperatives emerged directly from the

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,400
desire to

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,400
address exploitation

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,679
but it didn't inherently share the

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,799
recipes

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,080
of any innovation that were um

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:11,919
developed by the non-members right so

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:16,400
um cooperatives kind of aren't really

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:18,960
nice when considering the external world

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,960
inherently

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,520
right so while cooperatives and open

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,559
source projects emerge to solve

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,559
different problems

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,760
there's no reason to avoid the

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:34,840
combination of these two structures

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:37,280
uh and to address what we're saying

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,840
earlier uh

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,559
this has been done in uh traditional

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,799
ways

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:47,440
uh volk the company that i'm a part of

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,279
we actually develop open source software

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,960
so that's one example but

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,840
a new form of cooperative called a

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,840
platform cooperative

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,760
exists where the software infrastruc

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,760
software infrastructure is developed

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,120
and shared among the members of the

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,760
cooperative

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,120
and then they provide services on top of

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,159
that shared infrastructure

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:14,159
so it's open source so anyone can use it

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:19,840
but the services are actually

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,840
uh the the part that's sold

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,760
and uh so let's see some examples of

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,360
that

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,880
i want to say there's a company in

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,240
denver where

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,720
they um it's called the green taxi

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,919
cooperative and they're a platform

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
cooperative they develop

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,559
software that's essentially similar to

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,960
uber but it's open source

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,080
and i guess anyone can develop or

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,520
download develop and create their own

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,679
uh uh cooperative uh taxi cooperative

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,279
uh but the green taxi cooperative

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,400
actually uses it and then they sell

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,720
their services on

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,360
so on and so forth so that would be a

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,799
platform cooperative

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,520
so uh to answer

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,799
uh i think it was angie's question so to

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,360
combine

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,080
the combination in in summary the

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,679
combination

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,720
of decentralization uh democratic

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,480
governance

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,159
value of community alternative

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,559
compensation schemes

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,200
and ethical priorities provides a unique

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,960
position

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,159
on how we could organize employment

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,600
and goods together

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,480
right so cooperatives are really good at

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,520
employment

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,880
and exploitation dealing with that and

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,960
open source

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,000
is really sensitive to how the goods are

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
distributed

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,039
if you put those two together it seems

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:57,840
to be

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:57,840
in my opinion a match made

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,159
um any questions i think we've got

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,679
three minutes or something like that

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,320
i see a couple here

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,400
can you talk about the similarities

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,400
between let me publish this question

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,159
can you talk about the similarities

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,679
between differences between partnerships

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,200
and worker

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:32,000
cooperatives so

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,000
worker cooperatives really have

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,799
two tiers you have members and you have

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,480
associates partnerships

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,159
within um law firms

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,240
they can have two tiers they can have

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,159
three tiers you really don't find

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,400
them where they have more than three

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,240
tiers

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:58,240
um that would be a major difference um

00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,440
or a slight difference actually um

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,279
so you know a common misconception

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,600
within uh in my opinion

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,559
within cooperatives is that they're um

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,159
there there's

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:14,799
zero hierarchy you're a communist and

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,600
or anarchist or something like that no

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,760
there can be

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,520
you know that someone if you're in the

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,039
situation where it's a kind of equal you

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,039
kill someone brings on a project

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,960
there's a hierarchy there right it's not

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,559
completely flat

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,240
all right there's you know someone

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,159
brings in if you're a law firm

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,440
you bring in the big two million dollar

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,960
project

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,080
then um you know and and let's just say

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,679
that that law firm

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,960
only makes you know a million dollars a

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,520
year and someone brings them two million

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,520
dollar project

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,200
that person that brings it in gets to do

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,039
gets us do what they want

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
and they get to bring in who they want

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,480
and work on what they want and they make

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,000
it equitable

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,559
um you know um so there's a certain

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
amount of fairness that comes in there

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,120
um so there's some kind of um

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,559
hierarchy there uh and then i want to

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,360
say that

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,799
a cooperative that runs as a service and

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,440
a

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,960
services oriented type firm consultancy

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,600
that type

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,360
they end up having those types of

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,320
situations

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,360
um which i think is fair you know

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,279
there's a difference between

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,399
equitability

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,440
which is everyone's the same and

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,360
i'm sorry egalitarianism and where

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
everyone's the same and equitability

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,240
where it's

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,200
um someone brings in uh work and they

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,200
kind of

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,880
they kind of um they're they're able to

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,480
since they took the risk and they did

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,399
the front loading of

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,600
getting this work the marketing and all

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,799
that

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,760
sales they get um to decide who they

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,919
bring on and

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,240
and they get to have some more decisions

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,000
more power in the decisions so it's more

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,279
it's a flat iron it's a flatter

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,520
hierarchy but it's not completely flat

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,520
let's see here let's publish this

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,840
save this okay sometimes flat structures

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,200
can

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,399
still contribute to inequality just more

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,360
quietly think valve have you seen this

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,320
in practice

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,039
okay i kind of tried to address that so

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,320
um

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:31,440
there's a difference between egalitarian

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,279
and equitability right

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,919
and so it depends on what

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,360
i i want to think that you're saying

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,120
with inequality

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,480
someone contributed a whole lot

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,320
and maybe you don't mean this but

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,240
someone contributed a whole lot but then

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,399
they got compensated just the same as

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,440
everyone else

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,559
um equitability is a different and this

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,000
is a whole different

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,520
um uh discussion

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,120
but it's called if you're interested

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,520
it's called fair division

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,960
within game theory and it's also called

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,600
fair division within

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,279
law within estate planning and things

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,679
like that

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,480
um that's probably where you want to

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,279
look

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,799
if you want to um see some of the

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,720
answers for this but

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:26,080
yeah flatness just everyone being equal

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,320
is the same okay that's

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,399
a follow-up meaning some ideas were

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,880
valued less than others in conversation

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,799
even though everyone is equal

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,919
okay so i mean yeah i do see

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,200
that that can happen

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,600
and it'd be interesting i mean

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,080
it's it seems like that's not

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,520
necessarily

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,760
a function of cooperatives so that seems

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,679
like

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,679
to be a social problem

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,399
in my opinion though that that's a

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
interesting question though

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,159
let's do this uh it's 502 so i think

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,720
we're going over

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:15,840
um if you all want to

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,720
uh ask me some of these questions uh

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,080
join them

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,360
do a google search on the or let me

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,360
show some of these uh

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,640
papers

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,679
and um you can go ahead and visit the

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,679
austin software cooperative

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,440
uh google awesome software cooperatives

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,880
and join that meetup group and send me

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,640
these questions directly

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,840
and i can probably answer those

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:59,519
questions at that point

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:59,519
