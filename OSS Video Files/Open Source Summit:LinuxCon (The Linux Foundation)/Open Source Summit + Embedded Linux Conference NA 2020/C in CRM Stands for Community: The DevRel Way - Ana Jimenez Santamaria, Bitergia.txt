hi my name is anahimanet and today i'm

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,919
here to talk about

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,400
deference crms and community building

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,000
within

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,559
open source program office so let's get

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,559
started

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,000
during the years companies have realized

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,119
the

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,439
many benefits open source has

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,560
and a lot of them started to consume

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,279
open source projects but also

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,040
they some of them decided to contribute

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,280
to open source projects

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,399
i can give you an example for instance

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,239
samsung

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,120
samsung it's a company which software

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,920
has open source components and they

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,600
realized

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,480
that consuming to them wasn't enough

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,079
so they started to contribute as well to

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,680
get their contributors

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,160
accepted in those projects

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,920
and also there are other companies that

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,719
even release

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,199
new open source projects and the

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,080
benefits that that can have for instance

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,320
the benefit

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,360
many benefits can be for instance to

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,720
attract

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,000
talent and retain talent

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
so there are companies that do

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,520
all of this there are companies that

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,600
just focus on you

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,720
or or one part of this

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,200
so there is not only the inbound part

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,400
that will be going to consume open

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,439
source but the outbound part

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,479
so so companies um

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,840
realize that to accomplish all these

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,119
we need specialists from all different

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,079
fields we need liga we need

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,439
community building we need human

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,640
resources

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,159
so they started to incorporate

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,880
in their company a

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,320
place called open source program offices

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,840
in order to

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,079
have a centralized place to achieve

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,360
all these different tasks all these

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,879
different activities

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,319
so today's talk i would like to focus

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:20,000
on the area of the listening

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,120
open source project and

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,560
the main specialists that should be

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,000
involved in there

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,519
and talking about

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,440
community building specialists so when

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,840
we talk about community building

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
specialists the first thing that might

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
come to our mind will be

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,040
maybe project managers community

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,560
managers

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,480
marketing specialists but what about

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,920
their first

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:55,120
because i know just a few different are

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,480
getting into open source program offices

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,640
but it's not being mainstream at all and

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,920
for me the worlds are community building

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,879
specialists too

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,920
and can bring a lot of value to open

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,640
source program offices

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,959
so let's bring a little bit of context

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,959
about develop first

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,680
so developer relations roles

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,319
are diverse and what i mean with that is

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,319
that

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,599
depending whether they have been hired

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,959
by a foundation

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,239
or by a company and depending whether

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,000
they're the software of that foundation

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,680
or that company's open source

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,480
or not the objectives are gonna be

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,200
different they're they're gonna change

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
and

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,080
not only that they can be reported into

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,799
different departments i've

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
i've known the browse that reports to

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,640
marketing for instance and i've not

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,760
developed that report to engineering

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,040
which is a

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,080
completely different area and even

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,439
others reports to support

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,159
and this makes really really difficult

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,120
to measure success in the for their

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,920
words

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,879
because they're going to have different

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,480
kpis

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,080
different okay depending on

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,080
the department they belong to

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,600
so what does a

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,880
devil do actually so i will say

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,199
look at their name it says developer

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,800
relations and that means

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,720
building relationships with developers

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,320
and some divers might want to get

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,639
users to the company or foundation

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
so users will be the one that asks

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,199
questions

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,720
to github or jitlab or through forums

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,040
others would like to get contributors

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
so those that not only provides

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,120
questions

00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,320
but provides answers

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,160
and other ones might like to would like

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,560
to get maintainers

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,039
that are the one that provides code

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,360
to pull requests though through maths

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,880
requests for instance

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,080
so from an oscar point of view

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,080
what will be the call

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,479
so i think that it's important will be

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,759
important and really interesting

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,840
that a goal will be transitioned from

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,240
users to maintainers

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,400
and that's something a deaf world can

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,400
perfectly do

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,400
so to achieve this goal

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
uh i think it's really important to

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,160
understand first

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,240
the developer journeys because there are

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,240
multiple developer journeys

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,400
where the developer might um

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,680
might be and start to know

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,880
who what was the starting point and how

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,160
what is the journey that uh he or he is

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
having or they

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
is having

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,680
also it's important to understand

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,479
connections

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,960
so of course developers are not just in

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,520
one

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,440
platform they are not only on github or

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,520
on gitlab

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,520
they are on mailing lists they are on

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,720
chats

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,199
there on forums

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
so it's important to understand the

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,199
different connections

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,479
and where a single developer is across

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,280
the different platforms

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,840
and how those platforms are changing

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
when

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,199
we are looking at the different stages

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,240
of the developer unique

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,360
so okay that's great but how can we

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,560
achieve this

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,720
how can we know this so as

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,160
laura kelvin said to measure is to know

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,759
and here's a quick story this is

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,880
about chaff tap is one of our current

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,000
customers at

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,440
italia so chef

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,639
had also user

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,280
user community and contributor community

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,080
and they had this goal of okay we want

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,840
to transition from users to

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,720
to contributors right so

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,880
they identify their main platforms where

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
the community is so they

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,560
they know their their communities in

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,360
this course in github and

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,240
on in slack and when they become

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,520
contributors they start to add

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,800
more activity on github so

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,319
with this they were able to understand

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,560
the developer journey

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,000
and the different connections between

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,160
platforms

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,319
and this will help them to

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,960
know how much support and how much

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,800
intel internal effort and how much

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,919
internal developers who

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,919
have add to the different platforms

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,400
so when we think about what to measure

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
it gets clear metrics involved in

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,400
knowing

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,400
your community so be

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:24,960
involved as well so to get this

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,160
traditionally marketing this have been

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,680
done to a

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,800
crm customer relationship management

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,719
but is that

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,959
enough for develop specialists and

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,479
community specialists

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,080
because actually developers behaves

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,560
quite differently

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,560
so developers have different touch

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,440
points different motivations

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,000
and different ways to interact and

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,040
traditional crms cannot

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,680
achieve all this so i came up with the

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,399
idea

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:05,760
of the community relationship management

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,640
so to to achieve this

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,880
one important key point is the identity

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,000
affiliation management

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,160
so this will help us to

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,360
know who is who across the different

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,080
platforms

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,120
and avoid multiple identities

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,399
there are some existing tooling for that

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,720
uh one of them is searching hat

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,440
that it's part of cremo labs software

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,240
that is also part of the linux

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,279
foundation

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,800
chaos project it's a

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,120
so remo lab and certain car are 100

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,640
open source and we are always looking

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,160
for contributors so

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,040
i've i will give you the the url to the

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,240
github rebels in case you're interested

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,360
and you would like to contribute

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,440
and also just mention that certain heart

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,560
has a user interface the one you were

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,120
saying on the slides

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,279
that it's called hassle and that makes

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,320
easier to

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,440
make to declare organization no

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,600
affiliations uh even correct

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:21,440
attributions of contributors

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,519
so to sum up let's let's bring up these

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,120
three main ideas

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,320
so the first of all develop can help

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
to transition users to maintainers and

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,160
that

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,680
help open source ecosystems within all

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,880
schools

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,399
also traditional marketing platforms

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,160
are not enough to achieve all these

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,200
goals and affiliation management system

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,880
is key to build a crm with the

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,399
stanford community third story about

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,519
video here

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,360
we are the core developers of primal lab

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
and searching heart

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
and we are software development

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,160
analytics firm

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,399
and we are helping companies and

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,680
organizations to understand the software

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,160
development projects that matter to them

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,519
so that's all for today thank you so

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,160
much for staying

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,800
until the end and if you have any

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,040
questions

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,040
just feel free to ask bye

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,800
um hello

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,640
welcome thank you for staying here until

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,079
the end

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,959
so now we are gonna go through

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,079
questions i don't see any questions

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,120
right now

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,720
so i will just invite you to ask

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,640
any questions you may have about this

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,680
talk

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,279
let's wait maybe two three more minutes

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,279
because we have plenty of time

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,440
and yep i'm here to

00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,440
to help you

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:08,079
okay so uh what are the top three

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,480
metrics that debros should look at

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,200
okay uh well as i mentioned during the

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
talk

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,920
um depending on

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,320
the department a devil is there

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,040
that the devil is reporting to they

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,440
might be

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
having different ways to measure the

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,839
effort and

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,360
ways to measure that success but

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,440
um i think having metrics regarding

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,079
community building

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
uh should be also there i'm not saying

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,519
that is

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,120
the only thing but it should be

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,720
definitely be there

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,000
um actually i've a long time ago i

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,560
created a blog post

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,839
talking about those kind of metrics that

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,800
we should have such as the developer

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,880
engagement

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
i was talking about the developer

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,920
activity

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,760
let me i don't know if i can

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:08,000
um write you something here

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,519
okay so top metrics

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,519
so let me start with you the

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,200
blog post because i think it's gonna

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,040
help you better than

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,839
start mentioning some of those metrics

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,839
um

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,399
okay

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,639
here it goes okay

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
so

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
oh and then

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
okay i think you can see the link so

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,240
there

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,839
i talk about some metrics uh regarding

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,600
uh community community metrics

00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,959
and i hope it helps so

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,120
next questions uh what would you suggest

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,199
the develop professional

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:11,440
to get us started with getting data

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:14,639
to sew the roi

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,720
okay so

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,680
as i mentioned first of all will be

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,920
the community and start looking for

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,240
metrics regarding community

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,519
and after all of course depending on the

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,839
department you are

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,279
then start looking for specific for

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,320
instance if you're reporting to

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,639
marketing

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,360
then should be specific metrics for

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,120
marketing

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,079
if you're reporting to engineering

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,000
specific metrics for engineering

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:47,120
next question uh what is the easiest way

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
to manage community metrics when you're

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,680

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,199
that well

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,199
uh okay actually

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,079
i don't really know how to answer

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,880

uh okay

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,600
i will say if you have

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,199
go to the gylab repo in there there is a

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,079
lot of documentations

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,199
regarding exactly that answer so i will

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,120
suggest you go

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:51,759
to first chaos community

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:55,519
so it's this url

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,920
uh hold on i need to

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,920
okay

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,039
okay so go to that url and then

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,839
in software you will find the grammar

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,120
lab repo

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,679
and in there there's a lot of

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,439
documentation where you can

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,349
search for that exactly

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,659
okay

00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:22,659
[Music]

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:36,710
okay what else

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,710
[Music]

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,360
okay how can you community with all the

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,840
members

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,960
of the community users contributors

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,240
maintainers

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,160
so i will say first learn where those

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,440
users those contributors

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,360
and those maintainers are because

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,880
they will probably be on different

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,480
platforms

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:09,280
like for instance maybe your uh users

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,919
might be in this course and maybe your

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,320
maintainers maybe and contributors maybe

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,440
on github

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,000
so first you need to know exactly where

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,200
the different community like where your

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
users are

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
where your contributors are and where

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
your maintainers are

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
they might be also mixed like for

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,440
instance when i talk about

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
chef use case they they say that

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
sometimes

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,240
you can find users also on github

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,600
but mainly they will be on on this

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
course and slack

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,280
because they are not contributing

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,400
actively to go they are just asking

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,760
questions

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,200
and getting into into the platform into

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,400
the software

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,400
um okay

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,400
and

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,240
can you give an example of how metrics

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,280
have been used to understand a developer

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,200
journey

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:13,039
and how those insights allowed

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:17,039
growing the community okay so

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:20,080
as i was saying chef is a clear example

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,280
so they had a lot of users

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,400
but not so many contributors and what

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,919
they wanted to do

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:32,880
is go from users to contributors

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,080
and by looking at the different

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
platforms

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,880
they could understand the different

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,000
touch points and the different

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,559
interactions they were having when

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,640
being on a slack and then when those

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,200
people that were on the slack on on this

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,000
clothes

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,520
moved to jithaup from them it was

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,200
already a transition

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,880
and that can be done through the

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,160
affiliation management

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,039
and any affiliation management identity

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,760
affiliation identity management sorry

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,919
that can

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,520
also know who is who across the

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,919
different platforms so

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,919
if a person was initially having

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,760
activity on this course

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,840
and they move then move to github

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,159
this affiliation system can know that

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,080
that's the exact same person

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,360
even though we are talking about

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
complete different

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,080
platforms

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,839
uh what else um

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,839
[Music]

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,120
okay and i think i think that's all

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,440
yeah i'm not missing any any question i

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,440
think

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
yeah just to come back for about the
