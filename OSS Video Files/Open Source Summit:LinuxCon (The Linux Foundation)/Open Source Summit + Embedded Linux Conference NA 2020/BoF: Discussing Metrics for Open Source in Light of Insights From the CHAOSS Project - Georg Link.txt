welcome everyone to our stuff I'm are so

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:15,059
excited that we all found our way here

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:16,859
it's quite unusual format so let's see

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,520
let's make the best use of this as

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,880
you're all figuring out how our tools

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,050
work how our video conferencing work I'm

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,920
gonna share my screen because to set the

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,759
stage and start the conversation for our

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,500
birds of feather

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:41,190
I prepared a few slides the what I want

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:46,530
to talk about is the challenges around

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:48,930
open source metrics and to recap what

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,410
those challenges are and these are only

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,129
samples I'm sure you have many more and

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:58,410
I would love to hear your own challenges

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,149
afterwards then I want to talk about how

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,409
together we can be better stronger

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:07,320
faster in having open source metrics

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,549
specifically around the chaos project

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:16,170
and finally I want to have that open

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:20,150
conversation with you all a little bit

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:24,299
about myself I recently last year and

00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:26,430
PhD and my focus was in open source

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,869
corporate engagement in open source

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,159
through this very qualitative work

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:32,640
interviewing participating in open

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,329
source

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,850
we heard that especially companies want

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:43,560
to understand open source communities

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,920
through metrics and we had a session at

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,299
the open source leadership summit three

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,310
years ago in Lake tau and from that

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,320
session there was so much interest in

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,820
open source metrics that we started the

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,640
class project so I'm one of the

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,240
cofounders of the cares project and what

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,969
that is I will cover later after I

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,840
graduated I joined Peter gia as the

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,569
Director of Sales and what what really

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
defines me is my mission to help open

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,390
source

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,400
communities companies foundations become

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,190
professional in their use of open-source

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,430
metrics and I do this through the work

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,760
in the chaos project and through my work

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:32,260
in Victoria so that is a little bit

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,410
about me when you look at metrics the

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,410
definition of a metric is a method of

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,100
measuring something or the insights

00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,080
obtained from this measuring and so the

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,730
way I think of metrics is we have our

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,320
open source communities you have the

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:52,270
project data we have methods for

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,100
collecting the data for analyzing it and

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:59,530
then we have the insights that come from

00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:01,989
that now this is an ideal situation

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:07,000
there are several challenges to making

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:09,570
this happen challenges I grew up in

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,700
legal and ethical challenges

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:16,420
organizational challenges and

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,810
technological challenges the legal and

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:23,650
ethical challenges that I hear time and

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,850
time again are around laws like GDP are

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:31,480
the European General data protection

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:34,000
regulation that empowers the data

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,060
subjects or in our case there would be

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,090
our community members to have ownership

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,580
of the data and have a say in how that

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,940
data about them is being used or not

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,769
used and even delete it so that's a

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,720
challenge that you want to have metrics

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,830
about what is happening in our open

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,799
source communities with our members data

00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,170
privacy especially if we go into

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,130
diversity and inclusion there might be a

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,850
chance that we out someone so those are

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:09,940
concerns and then informed consent this

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:13,269
is something that especially is embedded

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:18,459
in GDP are when someone gives us

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:21,010
permission to analyze their data usually

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,610
there has to be an opt-in but there are

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:26,889
a few cases where opt-out is possible so

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,569
rather than our community members

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:33,819
yes it's okay there can be a gray area

00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:36,550
in open-source where we say our

00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:38,560
community members have contributed to an

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,129
open-source community knowing that all

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,930
of this is public and so because we're

00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:46,599
analyzing this to help the community we

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,139
have legitimate interest and we can opt

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:52,599
out or we give our community members an

00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:55,840
opt-out process where they can say no no

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:59,319
please do not analyze my data as part of

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,319
your analysis so those are some of the

00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,930
legal and ethical challenges that I keep

00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:09,189
hearing about going on to organizational

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:11,949
challenges why do you why do we measure

00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:15,219
open-source communities why do we look

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:18,219
at the data that is something that

00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:21,430
should be answered by our metric

00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:23,860
strategy they should know why we are

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:27,400
starting to embark on a metric journey

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,930
and only by knowing what it is that

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,879
we're looking for and why we are looking

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,719
at it can we actually get actionable

00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:38,020
insights because our communities produce

00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:42,520
a lot of trace data there's just data

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,469
that is created as our members interact

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,539
with each other

00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:50,319
and so starting to analyze that is like

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:52,029
opening a firehose of data and then

00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:57,879
another organizational challenge is

00:05:52,029 --> 00:06:00,219
buying in from the community I have seen

00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,099
communities that embark on a metric

00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:07,360
journey themselves so obviously there is

00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:10,360
buy-in in other cases the metrics might

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,779
be generated by a foundation or company

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,060
where it's a little bit more negotiation

00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:18,699
necessary with the community to make

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:24,139
sure everyone knows what is happening is

00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:28,009
on board with them now moving on to

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:32,990
technical challenges obviously we need

00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:35,779
to get quality data and getting that

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,969
data into a format that we can analyze

00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:40,400
and making sure that there are no

00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:43,849
inconsistencies in the data we collect

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,979
make sure that we can access the api's

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:49,689
of the tools that our open source

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:53,289
community is used all of those are the

00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:55,999
technical challenges around getting data

00:06:53,289 --> 00:07:00,560
managing identities is a very

00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:02,599
interesting challenge because our

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,900
community members use different logins

00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:08,479
different user names in different

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:13,210
collaboration platforms on emails in

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:16,610
slack on IRC and github it's on even on

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:19,189
Twitter and if we assume that we want to

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,500
understand our entire community we need

00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:25,219
to somehow consolidate all of these

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,020
different identities or profiles so that

00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:30,550
we can say this is actually the same

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,779
person which then gives us insights to a

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,400
contributor journey their activity

00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,580
throughout the different parts of the

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,449
project and so on and finally we need to

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,479
be able to do reporting visualization

00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:47,270
that is how we make the data that we

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:53,029
collect insightful and actionable and

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:55,180
how we do that is a challenge now after

00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:59,029
looking through all of these challenges

00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:03,279
want to recognize that there are some

00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:06,889
super experts who can manage all of this

00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,629
but those super experts are rare being

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,870
able to look at an open source community

00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:15,020
and say hey this is healthy community

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:18,139
because of these aspects there are some

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,120
people who can do this but as we heard

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:24,050
in the keynote this morning there are a

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,149
lot of people coming into open source or

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,500
taking general who don't have that

00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,839
background who don't have that knowledge

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:35,750
and so let's build together a tool set

00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,820
to go to be better stronger and faster

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,330
around open source metrics

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:44,870
and so that is what the chaos project is

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:48,080
about it's to create analytics and

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:52,640
metrics to help define community health

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,220
and to do that together we started this

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,210
project three years ago at the Linux

00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:02,080
Foundation with academics to really

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:05,120
provide the rigor with true makers like

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,430
Georgia to have software that provides

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,680
open-source metrics with the

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,470
practitioners from various companies and

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:17,290
foundations who actually use metrics in

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:21,400
their data so that is the background of

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:26,000
chaos and how we got started

00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:30,110
moving on to better developing practices

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,530
together helps us analyze communities as

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:37,760
at scale through metrics and figuring

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:41,560
out how to do that by having shared

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:46,600
practices a shared language around our

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:50,690
metrics gives us the ability to compare

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,610
across communities to transfer our NL a

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:58,520
nullity of analysis analytics skills

00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:01,430
having open-source metrics we can reduce

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,890
our bias and decision-making we no

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,810
longer have to rely on the grapevine to

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,410
know what's going on in our communities

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:11,600
we can actually use data to manage our

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,110
communities and some communities have

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,030
grown so large that there's no way a

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,270
single person can know what's going on

00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:23,000
everywhere but through the right metrics

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:25,490
we can actually get those insights we

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,430
need and even shared decision-making

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:32,080
because we have an objective foundation

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:34,100
to work from and so if we have

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,050
government's model in our open source

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,760
communities where we have shared

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,930
decision-making the metrics can help

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,800
inform those decisions so that is better

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,780
moving on to stronger chaos metrics we

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,530
define chaos metrics in the chaos

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,530
community

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,000
the work is organized in working groups

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:59,060
and there five of them diversity

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,250
inclusion is a work group that looks at

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,010
how do we understand how about coming

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,010
our communities are and how well do we

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:11,050
include people in our processes risk is

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:14,120
looking at business risk at license risk

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,060
the risk that communities go by because

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,300
no one wants to be stuck with them

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,890
project that they then have to maintain

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,260
and so understanding that risk is

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,490
important

00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,029
evolution is a working group that looks

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,860
at the growth maturity and decline of

00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:33,350
communities and defining metrics around

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,810
especially activity what's happening on

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,690
issue trackers in commits and different

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:43,610
channels and how's that evolving over

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:46,820
time to understand that we have value

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,940
metrics value metrics ones what's the

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,550
value of an open-source project in on

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,920
society as a whole through other

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,500
open-source communities to the

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,230
individual contributors that are in the

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,660
project or the value to businesses that

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:06,200
come to rely on the open source software

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,420
in their innovation streams so what are

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,300
the metrics we can understand there and

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,160
the last working group common is one we

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,770
started because there are metrics that

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,870
multiple of these working groups are

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:25,580
relying on like information about

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:27,860
contributors or what is a commit or what

00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,900
a forts how do we measure that and which

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,270
has multiple implications for other

00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:36,860
working groups we combine those in a

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:39,320
common working group to define that so

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:43,209
better stronger faster you're moving on

00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:46,790
to faster the caste project is producing

00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,709
software to collect data from

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:53,959
communities present the metrics analyze

00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:59,240
it the grim OLAP project is used by

00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:03,860
companies like red hat and Hoshi Corp

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,880
and Ericsson and others an augur is a

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,940
software of the

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,670
for piloting new metrics and trying out

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:19,940
ideas Craig it is another trophy app for

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:27,560
looking at the commit history moving on

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:30,980
to one last slide on lessons learned so

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,190
having had these conversations for three

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:39,740
years now about community metrics

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:41,720
open-source metrics I hear lots that we

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,639
should listen we should collect

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,180
everything when we start our metric

00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,370
journey because we don't know yet what

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,009
metrics might be interesting in the

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:56,120
future and having that data ready allows

00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:59,000
us to change our metrics strategy later

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,709
and they already have that foundation

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,069
especially when we start to implement

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:07,040
changes in our communities to then be

00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:09,170
able to say this was the baseline from

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,639
before and here are the changes in our

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:16,550
metrics afterwards also ask questions of

00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,279
the data to achieve your goals we use

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,980
the gqm or the goal question metric

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,230
approach in chaos to say you have to

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,000
start with your strategy you have to

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,990
understand why you're starting to look

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,120
at metrics and to choose the metrics so

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,829
that they support your understanding of

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,810
whether you reach the goals you have for

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:40,819
your open-source community just looking

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:44,680
at the easy to get metrics it doesn't

00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:48,380
actually help you make any improvements

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,899
also tell a story with the data and just

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,990
saying our commit count went up or down

00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:55,610
is not interesting enough or not

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,759
insightful enough you have to actually

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,319
know the context of the community

00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,019
understand why the change is happening

00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:07,220
and if you don't know why then start to

00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:09,769
dig a little deeper but let's say the

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,079
number of new issues or issue comments

00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:14,660
is going up it could be that there was a

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,790
release that is super buggy and we have

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,710
more but

00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,050
reports could be that there are more

00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,640
users suddenly who are asking questions

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,740
or it could just be that who is some of

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,560
Coda's around the corner and students

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,820
are asking questions because they're

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,650
interested in participating so know the

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,540
contacts tell the story

00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:39,420
avoid gaming of metrics if we use

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:43,950
metrics to incentivize our community

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:45,930
members then there is a chance that they

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,030
will focus their attention more on

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,660
improving their metrics than actually

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:54,240
advancing the community and that can

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,560
actually be detrimental to the community

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,590
as a whole and value all contributions

00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:04,140
we should not be limited to github

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,960
issues and commits just because those

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:11,490
are the easy metrics to get there are

00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:13,680
several resources I can recommend we

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:18,270
start a podcast where we like to share

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:22,020
stories experience around open source

00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:24,060
metrics community health and if you have

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:27,390
an interesting story please reach out

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm happy to get you on the podcast to

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:32,850
tell your story look at the metrics it's

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,790
all on our website look at the software

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,280
and then if you also want to be

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:41,280
participating in the chaos community

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:44,190
amongst peers then you're welcome to

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,960
join us there join the mailing list and

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:50,490
our regular calls they're open to

00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,440
everyone so together we can build

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,040
together we can be better stronger

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,160
faster about open-source metrics and I

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:03,270
would like to have a conversation with

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:06,690
you also if you could ask your questions

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,510
in the question section right in the

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:12,810
chat or even raise your hand I asked to

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:15,110
be on this platform so that we can

00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:19,230
actually bring you on stage so you can

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:21,750
ask questions or just make a comment

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,730
about your own experience those are the

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,830
birds of feathers so I'm not the

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,470
smartest person in the room we all have

00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:33,230
our own experiences to share and I

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,230
encourage you to take that opportunity

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:44,110
I'm gonna stop sharing my screen and

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:56,270
let's see we have a question here how do

00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,880
you think the metrics discovery and

00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:03,169
storytelling process changes between

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,080
metrics for the company's purposes such

00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,940
as use in marketing performance etc and

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,980
metrics to tell a story about the

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,899
community's health itself again I don't

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,110
have to be the one answering this if

00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:20,840
anyone has thoughts on this question

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,120
please raise your hand I'm happy to have

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:28,880
you come on stage and share your own

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:31,870
experience from my own perspective when

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,520
I talk about open-source metrics in an

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:39,620
organization there are business goals

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:43,600
objectives strategies that need to be

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:46,490
met and so the metrics should support

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,760
whether the company is achieving those

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,529
goals if the company has an open source

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,350
programs office that homes those

00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:57,049
programs office has its own goals and

00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:01,120
reasons for existing and being able to

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:05,539
show yes we are accomplishing why this

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,360
hospital was created can secure funding

00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:12,500
make sure that the program is not being

00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:16,880
cut in the future and even get more

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,919
funding for an expanded operation so

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,640
it's it's important to have that

00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:26,510
alignment with the goals community

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,360
health on is something that is

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:34,070
interesting maybe in that context as

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:37,820
well because that might be something

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:44,590
that introduces risk if it's missing or

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:44,590
that the company just cares about as

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:51,539
goodwill kind of thing but I think the

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,409
key focus in organization is to really

00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,860
line

00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:59,610
the metrics with the business objectives

00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:04,980
and if we're doing a report for an open

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:06,779
source community then we are much more

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,289
concerned about the longevity of the

00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:13,200
community and telling the story from a

00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:16,019
very different angle on the chaos

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,879
podcast on chaos cast we have an episode

00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:22,769
coming up with Ruth cheese Lee who is

00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:27,389
the community manager of the motek

00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:29,879
community and she had to do internal

00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:32,789
reporting but then used those same

00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:34,740
metrics analytics to craft them into a

00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:36,750
blog post and share them with the open

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,539
source community and the nice thing

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:45,090
about that is it creates a dialogue with

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:48,289
the community members on where the

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:52,200
community is going what the project is

00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:56,690
lacking or being good at and it can

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,690
actually drive some changes

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:16,529
so let's see here's another question

00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:22,559
what our user metric proxies when your

00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:26,129
project has no server and I assume this

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,859
question is how do we know how many

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:33,539
users does our project actually have

00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:36,690
because in open-source as we know as we

00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:41,879
don't like telemetry that much or having

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:43,619
a call home from the software because

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:50,029
that could be considered spying on our

00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:55,409
users and might be unethical so I see

00:21:50,029 --> 00:22:03,169
when you raise their hand you want to

00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:08,669
jump in here and talk about this hello

00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:10,859
am I here yeah I'm here about great um I

00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:13,200
like this question thank you for asking

00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:15,539
this question I think it's really

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,389
important because we're entering an age

00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:21,509
now with security becoming one of the

00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:24,509
most major factors of what metrics you

00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:27,989
choose or don't choose to view and your

00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:32,549
customer value journey and coming from

00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:34,529
an LGBTQ standpoint in my past I spent a

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:36,690
lot of time talking about like how do

00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:38,669
you count people who are closeted or

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,769
aren't available in your community and

00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:43,559
in a lot of ways it's very very

00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:45,149
difficult to tag a number to someone who

00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,149
explicitly doesn't want to be seen and

00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:49,830
it's kind of similar if you don't have a

00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:52,200
server or you don't have the technical

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,799
capacities to find that number maybe

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,720
there are ways qualitatively to get that

00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:02,669
number and it's okay if it's not

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,999
intensely accurate because accuracy

00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:09,359
doesn't matter so much as usefulness so

00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:12,059
if you can find a truth that's great get

00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:17,090
good then get better if you can find a

00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:17,090
more useful truth switch over to it

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:28,000
and so some some ways of getting some

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:32,560
insights to number of users these are

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:37,750
not exact Sciences but I've seen people

00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:45,600
use number of people asking questions on

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:51,310
Stack Overflow or issues and so on as as

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:58,510
indicators of more of your users user

00:23:51,310 --> 00:24:02,200
activity in in the case of LibreOffice I

00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:06,460
just had a conversation with them

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,210
they're looking at estimating how many

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,870
computers they're on what percentage of

00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:17,980
those computers they have based on

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:21,640
surveys and experience so those are

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:25,030
those are some ways that user account

00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,790
can be estimated if it's software like

00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:30,280
open SSL and we know it's in almost

00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:33,970
every server then we can count how many

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:42,160
servers there are or there at least

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:45,100
estimates out there to use so those are

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:50,500
some thoughts on getting a sense for how

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:55,950
many users there are um creating a user

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:59,310
community is a valuable thing to do

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:01,810
having the engagement of those users and

00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:05,500
that can give you an idea but I also

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:10,610
realized that not everyone is actually

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:12,470
willing to Regina use

00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:16,160
community many people are just happy

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:23,690
using an open-source software and never

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:25,240
declaring that they use it um let's see

00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,850
here's another question

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,210
[Music]

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,210
once we

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,820
what kind of metrics can we get to know

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,860
our users profile just ever registration

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:47,180
but developers were not registering and

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:49,670
not trying out our technology so I'm I

00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,400
have to make a few assumptions here

00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:54,860
it sounds like registration for

00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:00,410
developers so this open-source tool is

00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:02,120
for developers who are the users so they

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,640
are not the developers of the actual

00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:13,840
tool but the developers using that hubs

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:19,040
or software to get insights on who those

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:21,890
users are unfortunately there is no good

00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:27,290
way to do it besides asking them to

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:30,800
self-identify at least I have not seen

00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:34,540
anything in practice if anyone here on

00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:45,080
this buff has any ideas please jump in

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:48,050
share your insights here's another

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,480
question are there any plans to move to

00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,190
cloud in a sense of github application

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,410
or software as a service

00:26:52,190 --> 00:27:05,450
talk about ramallah the answer is yes

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:09,280
there is a cloud version you can type

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,130
it's called cauldron Colton dot IO is

00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:17,920
early alpha version of grimoire lab

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:23,600
where you can just plug in my answer

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,970
here I'll put in the chat so if you go

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,890
to a cauldron that IO

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:36,020
it's neat platform you can just enter

00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:39,160
your github organization or user and it

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,540
starts collecting data about that

00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,890
repositories inside that organization

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,660
and you

00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:47,060
can add multiple organizations or

00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,420
whatever project the repositories you

00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:54,530
want to analyze cauldron also supports

00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:57,650
gitlab any generic git repository that

00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:01,250
is publicly available and meetup data

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:04,730
and in the future cauldron will support

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:08,450
more data sources and be providing other

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:12,170
kinds of analytics but it's built on the

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,610
same grimoire lab technology and so I I

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:17,270
understand that I didn't talk about

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,850
grimoire lab during the slide so I'll

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:23,060
just give a little bit background

00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:28,160
grimore lab is a toolset developed by

00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:31,250
petroleum based on 15 plus years

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,590
experience on in doing research into

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:36,740
open source communities and projects and

00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:39,170
then for eight years ago Peter Chia was

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:42,080
started from this open source research

00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:46,160
team to actually provide metrics and

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,600
insights to companies because they were

00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,370
asking for it they were willing to pay

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:55,400
for it and about four years ago the

00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:58,700
company completely rewrote the metrics

00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:02,090
platform and this is what we now call it

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,850
the grimoire lab software and it's a

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:08,510
collection of different tools to ingest

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:11,390
data clean the data have processing on

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:14,090
it to the identity matching and then

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:18,320
have their consistent reporting and

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:21,680
dashboard and so-called remote i/o uses

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,920
the same technology under the hood but

00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,740
scales differently in the cloud and

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,950
makes the management of the platform

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,160
much easier so thank you for that

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,160
question

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:41,140
again this is

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:47,080
birds of a feather so I don't have to be

00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:49,840
the one talking here I'm happy to let

00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:54,070
any of you come on stage and share your

00:29:49,840 --> 00:30:01,720
experience in your stories and ask the

00:29:54,070 --> 00:30:05,230
other attendees questions so here's

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,620
another very interesting question how

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:10,179
can I know if my numbers are good or not

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:13,210
where can I find benchmarking for

00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:15,279
example near 100 people in our telegram

00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,640
community but only 10 percent are

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:25,929
engaged in answering questions is that

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:29,440
good there so the question for that and

00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:32,140
I see vineya raise their hand again I'm

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,470
happy to have you come on stage if you

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:38,529
want to take this question I might see

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,480
myself here as a facilitator I'm happy

00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:44,470
to talk but again wants to talk I'm

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,360
happy to give space I like this whole

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,179
stage thing but I kind of feel like it's

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,679
adding a lot to like power distance or

00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:53,679
whatever so it's like literally stepping

00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,390
up to a mic in a real place there's just

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,559
a certain level of anxiety to it it's

00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:03,370
kind of fun but well thank you been

00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:07,480
there for stepping up to the mic yeah I

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:09,669
hope my mic is actually good so kind of

00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,620
regarding this I I feel like it's an

00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:13,510
important question to ask and I kind of

00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,149
think that you should spend some time

00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:18,070
getting multiple answers for this

00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:21,130
because ultimately determining the

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,110
activity level of a individual community

00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:26,529
depends on where you come from I'm a

00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,299
marketer / brand community manager so I

00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:31,690
spend a lot of time looking at power

00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:34,750
users of which only about 2% will be

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,789
there but on the flip side I also spend

00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:40,149
a lot of time running love hour lurkers

00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:42,669
campaigns in order to get that 40% of

00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:45,580
people who are just reading to actually

00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:48,370
raise their hands and say I'm here so it

00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,860
largely depends I think on the value

00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,400
that you're providing essentially an

00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,530
invisible

00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,320
audience how do you determine what's

00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:57,940
actually useful and what's not useful

00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,590
because you can't force people to make

00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,290
comments I think it's an interesting

00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:05,050
question and benchmarking is gonna have

00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:08,140
to be based on week over week activity

00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:11,080
in your own group not some statement

00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:13,150
about your or me or anyone else in this

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,110
group saying no yeah ten percent seems

00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:18,880
fine or 40 percent is a little bit high

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,309
national benchmarking seems important

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,460
but you have to ask yourself is it a

00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:30,809
vanity metric in relation to the

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:33,190
community that you're right absolutely

00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:35,980
benchmarking against your own history as

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:40,510
one way to know whether your current 10

00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:43,090
percent is good an improvement or if

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:46,510
there was a loss an activity which could

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:48,910
be a warning sign yeah especially as

00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:51,130
your community grows that number will

00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:54,250
change smaller communities tend to have

00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:56,140
larger participation per user base

00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:59,050
whereas as you get larger and larger

00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,490
your lurkers start to outpace it so

00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:05,020
you'll see that percentage to go down

00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:07,960
week over week yeah and then if you will

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:12,550
actually want to benchmark something

00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,500
that during my PhD we've tried I I

00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:16,630
wasn't the one actually doing the work

00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:21,270
the Viet someone on our research team

00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:24,490
who was pursuing this idea that we can

00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:26,650
compare different projects and we can

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:31,690
just choose one that is similar to our

00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:34,990
own and to say we take benchmark to a

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:38,670
similar so if we were to take countries

00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:44,010
there's no point in comparing the GDP of

00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:46,870
a really wealthy OTC country with

00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:50,610
country that has does not have that

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:54,010
infrastructure and the history of having

00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:56,590
free markets and everything they're just

00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,990
very different and the same is true in

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:02,110
open-source communities we have very

00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:05,020
different governance structures we have

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:08,349
very different Kong

00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:11,619
collaboration patterns even project that

00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:14,109
use github have different ways of

00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:18,760
leveraging github to get the work in the

00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:22,990
communities done I mean an extreme case

00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:26,169
um use the pull request process for

00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,820
getting contributions or even as a

00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:30,310
maintainer doing contributions while

00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:35,859
others just pushed straight to master

00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:37,300
and measuring that activity level means

00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:40,300
something different in the communities

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:43,540
so as we do benchmarking in comparison

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:50,980
it's maybe have to make sure that we

00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:55,149
compare apples to apples another another

00:34:50,980 --> 00:35:00,160
related comment on this is quality

00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:02,140
models since the beginning of open

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,750
source community measurement in open

00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:08,700
source metrics there have been attempts

00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:11,080
to say our healthy community has these

00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,710
characteristics and we can build a

00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:19,119
quality model that takes the metrics in

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:22,000
defines thresholds you know like ten

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:26,170
percent of purchase of participation is

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:30,060
good so it gets a green light whereas if

00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:34,180
it's less it gets a orange or red light

00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:37,750
these quality models can be very

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:40,380
powerful for managing a program of open

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:43,690
source communities for keeping tabs on

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,940
many different projects and to say oh

00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:51,160
there's something going on here ib

00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:53,140
should look into this the work of

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,810
defining quality models however and

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:59,200
there are several in the academic

00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:02,380
literature the problem is that everyone

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:07,119
has slightly different criteria and so

00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:10,440
there's no unified open source quality

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,839
model that has been transcending or

00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:18,000
found useful by someone else than the

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,000
person or the group that created it

00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,400
where he started the chaos project

00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:27,400
actually we had a tool contributed to

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,160
the project that that it did exactly

00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:36,970
that that took the metrics in and then

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:38,800
had the stoplight red green yellow for

00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:43,990
the projects and you could parameterize

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:46,870
it was really awesome but the way the

00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:50,920
tool work didn't make sense to others

00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:54,130
and so right now it's in the Attic if

00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,620
anyone also continued that work please

00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:59,320
let us know we were happy to take the

00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:06,280
software back out of the attic and have

00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:12,340
a community around it so I see there are

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:15,520
some chat messages and again if anyone

00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:18,720
wants to come on stage and ask a

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:27,430
question I believe we still have ten

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:30,600
minutes left so plenty of time I'm just

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,600
reading the chat right now

00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:46,700
okay so like

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:50,940
in the chat we're veena and Carol and

00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:55,170
Yovani me are still talking about the

00:37:50,940 --> 00:38:00,680
how do we benchmark so that's that's

00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:08,220
awesome let's say we talked about

00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:12,150
several things um one thing that I find

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:15,359
really interesting is around gaming of

00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:18,660
metrics I'll just keep rambling on until

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:22,560
someone interjects raise a hand ask a

00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:25,560
question or something gimme gaming

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,470
metrics is something that from the very

00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:34,710
beginning of the chaos project has been

00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:38,339
discussed and the idea is that you get

00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:41,099
what you measure or if you measure you

00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:44,070
have to be careful what you measure

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:47,910
because you might just get that so you

00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:51,420
get the sentiment and it shapes behavior

00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:53,940
once we start measuring behavior people

00:38:51,420 --> 00:39:00,030
will respond to that and adjust their

00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:03,570
behavior the there are several things we

00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:07,589
have discussed to mitigate that one is

00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:11,310
to not provide metrics at the individual

00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:14,820
contributor level because if it's just a

00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:17,280
group effort then it's not as strong an

00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:21,510
individual incentive to shape the

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,420
behavior to improve the metrics then

00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:27,990
also be very mindful about what changes

00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:31,200
you want to make in the community and

00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:37,099
what metrics can indicate those changes

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:42,260
are successful and then try to guide the

00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:45,810
participation in that way but then also

00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:49,109
reevaluate after a while because their

00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:52,490
goals may have changed and the behavior

00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:55,099
that we were trying to incite at first

00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,749
might no longer be the be

00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:58,700
we need in that moment or we have

00:39:56,749 --> 00:40:00,950
reached our goal and that's time to

00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,380
focus on something else so we have to

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,170
reevaluate our metric strategy and

00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:12,740
change the metrics that we highlight and

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:16,700
focus on okay here's

00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:19,580
another question gaming is an awesome

00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:22,720
topic what plants are tactics do you all

00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,970
recommend once it comes to brass tacks

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,520
to ensure that the gamification metric

00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:31,550
doesn't infringe on natural organic

00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:35,630
activity in the group people usually

00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:38,000
worry about gamification backfiring now

00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,020
I'm not familiar with the term brass

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,930
tacks

00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:47,869
so I'm sorry that might just be that I'm

00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:50,510
not a native English speaker so meaning

00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:56,450
if you could elaborate for brass tacks

00:40:50,510 --> 00:41:00,440
this but going on into into verification

00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:03,650
if any of you here on this birds of a

00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,320
feather call session have thoughts on

00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:15,520
this please write in the chat or raise

00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:19,100
your hand and take the microphone so

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,650
gamification what I talked about so far

00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:24,230
was don't provide individual metrics

00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:27,550
because then people don't have an

00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:31,160
incentive to gain their own metrics and

00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:33,230
be very mindful about what metrics to

00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,180
highlight and focus on and especially

00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:39,710
what incentives are tied to which

00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:43,609
metrics and then reevaluate regularly

00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:45,410
whether those are still the goals of the

00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:54,190
community but you've reached the goals

00:41:45,410 --> 00:42:09,540
or should focus on something else breast

00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:17,500
rubber meets the road okay so that's on

00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:23,260
gaming I'm also asked often about the

00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:26,380
ethical and legal challenges and I I can

00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:31,390
reiterate and expand on what I was

00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:34,120
sharing earlier the the best strategy is

00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:40,600
to be as transparent and open with your

00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:42,790
community as you can because if we look

00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,840
at the legal side of things and again

00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:49,990
you should probably ask the lawyer for

00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,990
your specific context and goals but the

00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:56,440
legal context seems to be that unless

00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:58,780
someone complaints we're good and by

00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,750
being open transparent and providing

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:05,650
ways for people to or for our community

00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:09,190
members to opt out and have a say in the

00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:19,570
committee metrics strategy we can

00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:30,590
mitigate that upfront so there have been

00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:34,180
some messages in the chat yeah

00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:37,790
the Patras metric where people then

00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:44,800
create smaller almost trivial patches

00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:44,800
just to update their up their metrics

00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,640
yeah good a good example thanks for

00:43:54,140 --> 00:44:00,560
sharing that

00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:05,330
I know another community was having plus

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:10,150
one plus two up votes and the game

00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:14,180
turned into waiting for someone

00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:17,270
experienced to make a plus 2 up vote and

00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:23,060
then doing your own plus one right after

00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:24,650
that so you're reviewing code or I don't

00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:28,640
remember the exact context where this

00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:33,500
happened but it turned into a not so

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:36,350
useful exercise because you were earning

00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:46,820
status by doing these reviews and

00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:51,800
providing plus one plus two votes I also

00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:56,110
like vineya vineya is also active in the

00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,880
open source in the chaos project and a

00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,740
bit many of your key with coming on

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,490
stage again you have a really nice

00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:08,330
metaphor about dashboards and reports

00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:09,950
and before I say your your metaphor that

00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:13,970
I learned from you I want to give you

00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:16,450
the chance of maybe sharing that

00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,450
yourself

00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:27,330
yeah canary yes right yeah so this isn't

00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,040
actually my metaphor I want to be very

00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,830
clear this actually came from Chris

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,870
Mercer he goes by Mercer at measurement

00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,180
marketing I oh he's a measurement

00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:38,360
marketer and I have found that this is

00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:41,130
one of the most important ways for

00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:44,490
communities to look at how you're

00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:46,080
building out stuff so when I think of a

00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:48,660
dashboard I think of a dashboard on a

00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,540
car right you're going 75 miles down the

00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:53,430
highway you want to know how fast you're

00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,190
going whether you should slow down speed

00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:59,820
up stop or if your engines on fire those

00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:01,650
that's four maybe five metrics so what

00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,770
are those four or five metrics for you

00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:07,680
then once you discover that your engine

00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:09,060
is smoking something happened you pull

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,690
over to the side of the road and you ask

00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,820
yourself okay what happened that's the

00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:17,670
point where you open up the hood and you

00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:21,300
have a whole bunch of extra metrics was

00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:23,460
it oil was a gas was it fluids did

00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,160
something happen to my carburetor or was

00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,680
it my belt and understanding how that

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,530
engine runs understanding how your

00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,970
community's engine runs gives you an

00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,970
understanding of what you should check

00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,870
first what you should check last and

00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:39,300
what to do about it

00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:42,030
so dashboard should be a chief few

00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,320
metrics that tell you whether you're

00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:46,890
doing well keep going

00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:49,650
hit the brakes slow down and your

00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,240
reports your detailed inclinations and

00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,820
everything like that they should be out

00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,800
of your sight while you're driving when

00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,660
something does happen that's when you

00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:04,140
open up the hood and you take a look at

00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:07,230
your report metrics yeah thank you

00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:09,090
I even though the metaphor might not

00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:11,100
come from you I it will always be

00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:15,900
attributed to you in my mind because I

00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:18,060
learned it yeah and I probably shouldn't

00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,670
say this here necessarily but I am

00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,530
working on getting Mercer onto a Kaos

00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:27,870
cast so we can hear it straight from the

00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:29,670
horse's mouth so to speak and we'll kind

00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,770
of discuss that a little bit more on

00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,610
Kaos cast as we move forward into the

00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:38,560
future I guess

00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:40,920
I'm so looking forward to that yeah so I

00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,360
I think we have about a minute left

00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,510
vineya if you want to stay on if you

00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:50,820
have any thoughts you can do that if

00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:53,170
anyone else has any ideas any questions

00:47:50,820 --> 00:48:00,400
last-minute thoughts please use the chat

00:47:53,170 --> 00:48:03,280
or the questions feature here you know

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,390
in any case I thank you for joining us

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,450
for this birds of a feather in this very

00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:12,930
new format I appreciate all of your

00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:18,450
questions and engagement participation

00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:21,520
we can head over to the slack channel

00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:24,850
with pound sign to track community

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:28,960
leadership a spot to do and continue the

00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:32,430
conversation there if and I'll be there

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,880
for the next two days just hanging out

00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:42,850
so ping me there you can also start an

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:46,390
individual conversation so maybe I just

00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:52,600
SAR clapping hands rise up how do you do

00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:54,280
it well that is so much fun oh you know

00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,500
I was trying to figure out how to do

00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,990
emoticons on individual chats it looks

00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,870
like they just do the Facebook live

00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:03,790
thing going on here I actually have a

00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,950
question I hope you don't mind but just

00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:08,650
something super simple what is

00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:10,840
everyone's vote on whether the last icon

00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:14,200
is prayer hands or two people

00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:20,800
high-fiving I kind of want to know where

00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:24,730
people wait that I honestly don't know

00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,950
oh yeah I didn't even think it was

00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:29,140
prayer hands for the longest time in it

00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,960
I thought it was two people high-fiving

00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:35,950
but it makes sense because bs leaves are

00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:42,010
both the same color and I think anyway

00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:43,960
when I when I look at the emoticons here

00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:46,340
on my Mac I think it does say their

00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:52,310
prayer hands has the

00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:53,980
official name for them yeah yeah I've

00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:56,600
never thought of them as high fiving

00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,670
yeah a lot of people just started using

00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,560
them as high-fiving in a few of the

00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:06,560
other online conferences I've had since

00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:09,620
co-ed it's interesting yeah Ronia I also

00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:13,910
think of them as thank you or something

00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:14,660
yeah I guess Kyle the math says hands

00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:18,320
pressed together

00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:20,780
oh good

00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,410
let's close the session we're out of

00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,230
