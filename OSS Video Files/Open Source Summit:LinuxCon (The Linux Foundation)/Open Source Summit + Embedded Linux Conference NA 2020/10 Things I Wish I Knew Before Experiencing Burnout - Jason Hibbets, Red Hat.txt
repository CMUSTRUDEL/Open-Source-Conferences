hi everyone uh welcome to open source

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,839
summit my name is jason hibbitz

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,359
i'm a senior community architect at red

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,440
hat and today we're going to talk about

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,120
burnout

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,960
first i want to mention that this is my

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,599
experience i'm not the expert on this

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,839
topic

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,840
i only know what happened to me during

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,279
my situation and how i dealt with it

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,720
but during today's session i do want to

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,080
try to interact with you using the chat

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
functionality so

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,760
we'll get there i encourage you to ask

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,039
questions and also answer each other's

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,800
questions if you have if you want to

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,079
share your own experience

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,160
so my story begins in early 2017 i was

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600
mentally in a pretty bad spot

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
it's basically kind of this perfect

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
storm of stress um the kind that no one

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,960
really asked for

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
for me work was piling up to a point

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,440
where i didn't

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,520
i didn't want to do the things that were

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,039
expected of me i was training for some

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,399
spring half marathons

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
which should have normally been stress

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,760
relief but i was putting some additional

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,480
pressure on myself to perform at a high

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,840
level

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,000
and on top of the everyday family

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,360
obligations we had a surgery in our

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
household that

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,719
really added to some of the stress i was

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,399
experiencing

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
so i finally reached a breaking point

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
and it wasn't just one thing

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,520
it was a culmination of things and it

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,159
really hit me from the blind side

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,439
i was completely caught off guard i

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,320
never thought that i would be a victim

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,720
of burnout

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,360
i was aware of burnout um it was on my

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,840
radar

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,560
with the communities that i work with um

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,799
making sure

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,200
uh to be on the lookout for other people

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
burning out not myself

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
i remember thinking that something was

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,840
wrong and something was a little off but

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,840
i couldn't quite put my finger on it

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
so um i distinctly remember the day that

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,040
i cried

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
and they i was in the office uh having

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
my daily one-on-one or my weekly

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,880
one-on-one with my manager

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,720
and like the faucets just wouldn't stop

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,840
it i just broke it was a really low

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,920
point for me

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
um my manager did assure me that we

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,479
would get through this um

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
neither of us had gone through this

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,280
experience before so he sent me home

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
and um and basically i kind of took the

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,000
rest of the day off kept shut the laptop

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,479
down and

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
started coming up with a plan so luckily

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
uh i had

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
i already had some vacation on the

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,799
calendar so that was my short term

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,640
target

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,240
day by just you know one day at a time

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,800
get to that vacation

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,120
and uh when i did take that vacation i

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,040
intentionally didn't pack any technology

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
clothing at all so if anyone knows my

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
wardrobe and how many conferences i go

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,599
to and how many tech shirts i have

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,280
uh that was a pretty thin suitcase um

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,959
you know when i reflect upon that

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,879
you know i was really just kind of

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
pushing myself to exceed the goals that

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,920
my team creates and you know i really

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,280
like the feeling when we

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,280
accomplish something and meet new um and

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
make our goals but this experience was a

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,319
little bit different it wasn't a healthy

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
win for me it wasn't a healthy win for

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,519
my team

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
and i felt like i let everyone self down

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
including myself

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
so when i looked back i was definitely

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,080
showing the signs of burnout

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
i didn't have much of an appetite i was

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
tired all the time i was sleeping in and

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
it wasn't because of jet lag or travel

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
i was doing strange things like i would

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
fire up my hot spot and work from the

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
back of my car when i was doing the

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,840
uh you know the family rounds with the

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,280
vehicle

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,200
i was cleaning off my desk like i was

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,560
about to quit my job but more

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,159
importantly like i wasn't

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,400
motivated to do things that i normally

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,120
love to do i was feeling really blah

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
about work

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
and i was avoiding people that i would

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,599
normally hang out with

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
so what did i do i scheduled a physical

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,640
my annual physical

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,480
i talked to my doctor about my situation

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,280
and they recommended that i see a

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,879
psychologist

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
so i sat on the couch a few weeks later

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,760
talked it out and was diagnosed with

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,360
severe anxiety

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,120
you know what i mentioned previously are

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
signs of depression and burnout

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,480
and that's a lesson that i learned the

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
hard way some of the tips that i'm going

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,680
to be providing today

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
and solutions may not work for your

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
particular situation so

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,480
hopefully you'll be able to find them

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,159
useful and

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,239
before we move on i want to say that

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,680
it's perfectly okay to ask for help

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,519
in fact i would encourage it if you're

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
feeling

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
if you identify any of these symptoms in

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,959
your life

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,319
so there's a lot of passion from

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
community members and open source and

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
tech in general

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
we push ourselves to contribute to

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,439
projects we sign up for issues to work

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
on

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,560
we take on more than we can volunteer

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,400
for sometimes

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
and so i did some research and wanted to

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,959
look at some numbers here

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,560
um gallup did a survey in 2018 and

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,959
uh 7 500 full-time employees 23

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,840
of them of those workers said they felt

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
burnt out

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,759
more often than not an additional 44

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
reported feeling burned out sometimes

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,280
and so those are

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
some pretty staggering numbers over 50

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,320
people are

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
feeling some sort of stress or anxiety

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,800
here

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
uh and then i want to talk a little bit

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
about passion um passion means going

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,919
above and beyond

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,520
and a word of caution caution is that

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,280
passion can lead to burnout

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
and i felt like that was partly my

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
situation you know i was willing to work

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,720
the extra hours i was willing to sign up

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,040
for extra tasks and help my team

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,800
push myself to perform but and i still

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,320
am but now i have

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,840
some limitations i know when i can push

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,040
hard i know when i can say

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,639
no or when i can uh defer

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,840
um tasks and objectives

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,280
but um our work doesn't need to be

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
balanced it needs to be balanced with

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,320
three things

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,600
and that's recognition rewards and

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,360
relaxation

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,880
so take your passion for work and make

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
it work for you but balance it with

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,639
these three things

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,639
and it's important for all of us to know

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,400
the signs of burnout so

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,199
to take measures to prevent burnout and

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,199
to reduce stress

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,960
all right so um let's see lesson number

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,639
one here let's get going

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
is that uh you should know the sign as a

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,560
burnout uh simply put

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
burnout is a form of depression where

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
you are not motivated to perform the

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400
things

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,000
that are expected of you at your job or

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,919
in your life

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
it's not the occasional slacking off

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,400
because the weather is nice

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
it's a build up of emotional stress

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
where

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,080
as i said you don't want to do the

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,919
things that are asked of you uh

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
sometimes health providers

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
might refer to this as compassion

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,880
fatigue so you know we talked about how

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,880
passion could lead to burnout

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
um you know you work really hard um but

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,840
you know there's just so many

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,120
factors that can lead to burnout whether

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,360
it's too much travel

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,639
if we ever get to travel again unclear

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
expectations

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,759
unreasonable deadlines toxic cultures at

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
work

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,919
or maybe it's a work-life imbalance i

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
remember one thing that was extremely

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,720
abnormal for me

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,440
is because i'm so social is that i

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,240
started to separate myself from my team

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,520
you know as an example if it was uh you

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,880
know hey jason do you want to go grab

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,800
lunch

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,560
i would say no i'm too busy i was you

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
know too busy to hang out with people

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
so according to the mayo clinic here's a

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
few things i won't go through each of

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
them here but

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
um these are a few things you can ask

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
yourself if you think you're

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,840
experiencing the signs of burnout

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,199
uh are you becoming cynical at work

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,919
do you lack energy to do things you

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,919
normally like to do are you using food

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,440
drugs or alcohol to feel better or to

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,160
simply not feel at all

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,520
and have your sleeping habits changed

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,599
those are just a few but

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,080
really good things to to analyze here

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,080
for yourself

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,280
so i mentioned a few symptoms above that

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,440
i was experiencing but

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,039
um let's get a better picture of of the

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,880
real signs of burnout or additional

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,440
signs of burnout sorry

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,919
now sometimes people can get really ill

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,720
ill

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,840
sorry you might feel loss of appetite or

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,120
a loss and interest of things you

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,800
normally like

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,880
as i said i was feeling separation from

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,360
my team i was quote too busy

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,960
to be around them i wasn't sleeping well

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,599
i would stay up late i would sleep in

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
longer

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,599
and ultimately this you know led to my

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,000
severe anxiety

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,840
one thing to note though is that it is

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
very difficult to self-diagnose

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,280
burnout uh this is why you and your team

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,199
should know the signs and hold each

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
other accountable

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,240
and another thing i want to mention here

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
is that you should always listen to your

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,639
body

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
if your body is telling you no then you

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,440
should take a step back and try to piece

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
together what's happening

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,120
definitely that was my situation where i

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,879
was not early able to self-diagnose

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
number two the second lesson i want to

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,840
share is uh kind of techniques on how to

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,520
prevent burnout

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,599
first of all you should take time away

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400
from the job find time to unplug and

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,720
unwind

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,960
this means planning vacations or

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,639
probably staycations now

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,280
or other just planned time away from

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,360
work i know it could be really hard to

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
unplug like this but

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,479
with all the pressures we put on

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
ourselves and obligations we have from

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,720
work it's

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,720
it's really healthy for us to do that

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160
so in my experience you need at least

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,360
two checkouts a year

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,840
um again i kind of defining checking out

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,039
as

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,839
no email laptops down um you know make

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,000
sure you've got

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,039
work uh people to back you up and what

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,040
you do things of that nature

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,959
you know i i typically um

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,160
i recommend two but i found myself

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,640
taking three

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,480
um unplugs all um and completely

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,320
escaping over the last few years

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,560
uh i'll tell you that it's a wonderful

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,680
feeling uh i feel like i'm in control

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,279
and it's working really

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,080
really great for me number three

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,640
is uh not uh easier said than done but

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
um you know

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,920
it's really easy to be connected 24

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,680
hours a day but we've gotta

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,360
we've gotta unplug being connected all

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,040
the time is not healthy for us

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,040
i'm hoping that one thing that humans

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,680
can learn from this kobe 19 situation

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,600
we're in is just just slow down

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,360
take the time and and slow down and

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,399
enjoy the moment

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,839
now one way to avoid always being on is

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,519
to share your availability

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,760
i find that my work calendar can be

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440
really helpful for this

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
you know there are special times that

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
you want to be really specific about

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,959
your schedule

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,720
about what your availability is and so

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,200
as an example if you're out of the

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,120
office for you know maybe a conference

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,480
or if you're on vacation

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
communicate your time constraints and

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,640
availability with people in advance

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,480
this would be you know a week ahead of

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,760
time letting your team or the community

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
work with know that hey i'm going to be

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
out next week

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,680
if you don't if you don't get something

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,800
to me by this time

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,959
then it's going to have to wait until i

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,760
get back let people know if you're

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,160
checking

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
your email your phone or chat and as a

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,399
reminder if

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,839
you're on vacation the answer is i'm not

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,839
checking email phone or chat

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,240
a couple other tips here use an

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,680
autoresponder to set expectations

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,440
you can share your schedule there you

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,720
can provide other contacts if someone

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,519
needs assistance

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
um my autoresponder typically will say

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
um

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
you know i'm out until xdate if you need

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,760
help with this

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,079
um email this person uh living the dream

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,640
right

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,519
that's my that's my autoresponder

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,480
another example

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,440
is to um this is a thing that my team

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,760
did early on

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
um earlier this year when cobit started

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,760
and we started to

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,600
become more of a distributed team

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,160
is to uh define how everyone should

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
communicate so we set clear expectations

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,399
on how

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
we communicate in real time versus

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,800
asynchronously asynchronously

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,959
and we also defined how we could better

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,760
run our meetings

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,360
and so my team decided that if we needed

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,360
a response from someone that email is

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,720
our definitive answer not chat

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,640
and so that's been working really well

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
for us

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
all right number four uh impose limits

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,600
and share them

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,079
which can help save you time and help

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,640
prioritize important things in your life

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,240
now you can set limits around you know

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,279
the amount of time you research an issue

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,959
or

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
limit the time you spend on checking

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,040
email you can block time in your

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,399
calendar to avoid interruptions

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,839
you can turn off chat email

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,120
notifications and stop the constant

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,800
distractions

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
i was recently setting up a meeting with

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,399
a coworker i literally saw

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,560
on their calendar it says absolutely no

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,519
meetings so that was a clear indicator

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,120
to me

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,120
that that was not a good time to meet

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,959
with that person

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,640
uh another great example for my personal

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,880
life um is that uh

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,160
you know attending meetups uh when we

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,839
were able to meet in person

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
um you know i we could go to several

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,440
meetups a day here um

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
in the triangle area of north carolina

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
and about the time when my daughter was

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
three

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
and my son was nine i realized that i

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
wanted to be home more in the evenings

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,839
to see my kids

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
and so i didn't want to turn around 10

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,600
years later and say hey you know my kids

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
are all grown up but and i went to all

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,120
these great meetups and i missed out on

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,240
a really important part of their lives

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,800
so i decided to set a limit and

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
i my limit was i could attend up to two

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
meetups per week

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,680
and so this helped me um this policy

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,519
helped me prioritize which meetups

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,680
were important and ultimately gave me

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,880
more time with the family

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,160
you know there are a few exceptions

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,959
throughout the year but for the most

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,240
part i pre

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,839
i stick to that limit number five

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,519
is that having a flexible work schedule

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
can be really key to addressing a lot of

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,600
the after hours things that um you know

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,320
i deal with in my situation

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
and um and i know it's not uh i know

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,639
everyone can't have a flexible work

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,200
schedule so

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,800
um you know do the best you can here

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,160
it's really helpful for someone like me

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,480
to be able to manage my pro

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,079
my productivity um mostly because i'm

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
not much of a morning person so

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,000
i reserve my mornings to kind of get up

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,839
exercise and then kind of plan the day

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,639
out ahead of time

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,160
during that time so um you know the

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,079
workouts are great for me gets the blood

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,399
flowing helps me prepare for the day

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,240
it's also a really great stress reliever

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,600
um so when you approach your schedule i

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
recommend that you kind of define what

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
your core hours are

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,480
uh if something comes up whether it's

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
work or personal that impacts those core

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,120
hours

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,959
uh let someone know um you know as an

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,200
example if i were going to a meet-up

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,560
this evening

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,480
you know i would i might come into the

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,680
office a little later uh let my team

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
know that hey you know going to be in

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
the office a little later today because

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,399
i've got to meet up tonight

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,880
and um don't want to take all my time

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,880
away from that

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,399
let's see there it is next button next

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,800
um

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,560
you know also another example is you

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,959
know if you have a late night code push

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,560
uh adjust your data start later um so my

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,199
team typically does good releases in the

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,199
morning

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,440
so when that happens i just shift my day

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,959
around so i'll get up

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,720
get up a little earlier than normal do

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,320
the qa in production

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,320
and then um i'll either

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,399
take a break from that or kind of like

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
find that find the time to do that

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,240
better so

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,560
that could also be um like maybe taking

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,920
a day off earlier or later on the week

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
maybe you take friday off or something

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
like that so it's really good to have

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
that balance of schedule

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
if you have something that's going to be

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,839
outside of your normal um

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,839
your normal schedule that you have

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,440
okay uh number six uh easier said than

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,519
done but

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,199
um you know how do you spend your time

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,600
you know let's uh i'm gonna

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,320
try to use the chat functionality here

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
you know

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,040
just kind of curious are you trapped in

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,079
meetings are you spending hours

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,160
answering email

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,240
on the chat on the scale of one to five

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,839
one being that you don't know how

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,519
um you spend your time five being you

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,000
know exactly how you spend your time

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,040
uh just drop that rating into the chat

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,760
and uh love to see

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,120
you know how people um how people how

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
much people are aware of how they spend

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,399
their time

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,680
or not um so here's a great exercise you

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,920
can do

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,920
if you uh if you're a one two three um

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,639
you uh i might recommend that you know

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,279
take a week

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,680
and write down exactly what you do and

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,079
then

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,760
take some time to analyze what you do

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,639
figuring this out can help you gain

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,000
efficiency

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,399
identify stressful things in your

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
schedule try to reduce them

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,920
remove them or to pair them with the

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,720
stress reliever so that being

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,360
if you know you're gonna have a

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,360
stressful uh situation at work um

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
try to you know put that up against the

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,480
lunch break or

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,079
take a walk around the block or whatever

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,920
whatever you can do to kind of balance

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,560
that out

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,399
so as an example you know pre-coded i

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,279
would block out my mornings from 8 30 to

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,040
9 30.

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,560
um i would get my daughter on the school

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,920
bus and then

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,759
use the rest of the remaining time to do

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,600
a workout so i've

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,880
updated that for kovid and now i block

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
out 9 30

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,920
um i do a check in between 9 9 30 and

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
then i block out 10 to 11 for a workout

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,279
so my team knows my schedule

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,720
and knows my availability there

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,240
all right number seven uh one of the

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,279
worst abusers of how we spend our time

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,560
is unplanned work

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,480
i absolutely hate unplanned work um

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,800
and and that there's just so much that's

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,440
bad about it so uh you know using the

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,519
chat again

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,079
uh throw in a plus one if you agree that

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,000
you um really dislike unplanned work

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,040
uh and maybe you don't agree with it

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,279
throw in a negative one for that

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,759
um i always try to find a way to convert

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,720
my unplanned work into planned work

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,160
um and you know try to find out how

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,320
different ways we can automate things

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,440
too that's usually helpful one of the

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,759
techniques that i use

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,759
to to move unplanned work into planned

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,560
work is to use a compound board like

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,199
trello

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,079
there are many different technology

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,360
tools out there

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,720
that are like this um you know i

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,440
basically uh avoid trying to use my

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,040
email inbox as a to-do list so i take

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,880
things out of email and i

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,320
make them into cards and then i can

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,040
prioritize them

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
i also want to mention here um

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,680
documentation

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,440
i think it's really important important

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,839
to document what you do

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,000
this way someone can jump in and be a

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,000
backup to what you're working on

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,360
and also it's uh it's you know really

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,799
not job security if you

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,360
when if you think about it when it when

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,480
it's all said and done

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,000
all right number eight i'm going to

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,280
transition here to talk a little about

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,640
different ways to help manage stress

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,400
you know you should have some sort of

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,919
stress outlet whether it's a hobby a

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
sport or an activity

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,839
something that frees your mind from from

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,679
work and from other life demands

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,959
if you work on computers all day i might

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,200
suggest that you

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,880
your hobby be unplugged and offline

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
so again i want to use the chat here i'd

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,679
love to to see what some of your

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,799
interests and hobbies are

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,880
you know it could be things like

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,480
painting photography hiking

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,559
reading or really anything that you find

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,320
relaxing um so hopefully uh

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
if you want to share what you what your

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,080
hobbies are maybe you can find

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,600
someone else in the talk here that will

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,320
um

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,320
you can connect with

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,480
my one of my go-to stress outlets is

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,880
exercise right i

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,559
do a variety of work whether it's cardio

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,600
weightlifting swimming running

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,120
cycling surfing um you know there's a i

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,919
have a variety of exercises that

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,039
keep me stress relief it help with my

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,679
stress

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,120
um you know it also here it might sound

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,600
a little harsh but you can't help you

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
your

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,960
your team or yourself or your family if

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,640
you're not in a good spot

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,799
and i always think about the airplane

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,960
analogy here um you know

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,360
when we used to fly and travel uh in the

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,520
event or loss of cabin pressure

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,400
an oxygen mask will drop down put your

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,559
mask on first before helping others

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,400
you know again make time for yourself i

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,600
refer to this as me time

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,120
that could be meditation it could be

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,799
reading it could be exercise or your

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,840
favorite hobby

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,160
and don't um

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
avoid giving up your me time i i think

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,360
that's uh you should

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,799
you should protect that time at all cost

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,320
all right number nine another way to

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
reduce stress is to better manage your

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,640
time

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,720
um you know you get to choose how you

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,919
spend your time is it family work self

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,440
social it's it's up to you

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,960
you know find ways to work more

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,640
efficiently more effectively

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
and make sure you put yourself first

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
again um don't

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,720
you can't help others if you're in a bad

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,799
spot so here are a few tips on

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,640
time management uh you know you can use

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,480
a calendar to manage your time

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,480
we'll again block off your me time

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,320
protect blocks of time to get work done

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,240
uh analyze how you spend your time so

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,520
you can gain efficiency there

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,000
default to 30-minute meetings

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
use a to-do list really simple start

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,559
your day by doing the most important

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,720
things first

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,919
don't waste time waiting fill in that

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,480
waiting time with

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,080
maybe something a mindless task or you

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,559
know it's time to relax

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,160
uh match similar um things and tasks

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,520
together to help um

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,919
to help your brain from having to switch

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,440
gears and then learn how to delegate

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,039
i know this can be really difficult for

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,039
some people um so uh if you need help

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,799
with delegation uh there is a great talk

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,559
by deb nicholson uh i won't play the

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,160
video here but the link is there

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,919
it's called delegate like a boss uh

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,120
really helpful tips from deb

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,120
i encourage you to watch that if you

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,280
need help with delegation and

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,720
number 10 there's a couple articles i'm

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,120

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,919
you know i really think the hard part

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
here is that the hard part about saying

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,919
those

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,600
there's so much opportunity and so many

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,320
exciting things you can be part of

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,679
but you know use logic and reason to um

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,960
to make those decisions instead of

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
committing to something based off your

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
emotion

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,760
uh there's another article again on

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,799

um you know saying uh let's say

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,080
let's get it right here uh saying yes in

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,840
order to get better at saying no

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,679
she's got a great set of questions to

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,400
ask you know is it no or is it not right

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,080
now

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
uh is it no or is it not the way you

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,440
asked me to do it uh is it no

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,039
or can we do a little bit now a little

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,960
bit later so she's got a great set of

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,760
lists there a great list of things to go

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
through

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,760
and if you do decide to decline an

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,360
opportunity say no with grace

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,159
you know normally i would you know jump

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,600
all over this opportunity but um

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,360
i don't have the time to put the effort

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,799
in uh right now and you know

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,559
many times people will appreciate that

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,000
all right um so wrapping up here you

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,559
know don't suffer in silence whatever

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,880
you do

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,400
um if you are approaching burnout um you

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,960
don't have to face it by yourself um

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,640
again

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,200
approach your manager talk to a trusted

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,280
colleague seek medical

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,640
help if you need to you know once i

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,960
figured out what was wrong i was able to

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,640
devise a plan and recover

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,919
i found in my situation that time away

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,520
from keyboard was the best thing

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,679
and now and while i still have intense

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,400
moments at work i'm much better equipped

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,559
to deal with it

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
i've got the support of my team uh and

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,360
my team is aware of

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,960
the signs of burnout and we hold each

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,679
other accountable so it's great to have

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,880
that

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,200
uh and here's the moment you've all been

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,960
waiting for here is the top 10 list

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,799
i won't read all of them since we just

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,960
went through them but i will say that

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,840
you know burnout can lead to fatigue

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,520
excessive stress sadness anger

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,600
irritability insomnia

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,440
alcohol or substance abuse and other

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,640
medical conditions

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,360
these are all things that are not good

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,039
for humans so if you're a manager

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,960
uh if you're a people manager or you

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,720

thank you so much

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,760
all right well that was fun watching

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,760
yourself do a recording um i've got just

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,520
a few minutes for questions and then

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,360
happy to jump over and hang out on slack

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,440
for a little bit uh the first question

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,000
is can you provide our slides uh yes i

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,679
will

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,280
add that to slack here in just a few

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,240
minutes it's got complete speaker notes

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,039
so hopefully that will be a good

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,039
resource for you

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:49,760
second question is about

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,760
exit strategies and you know how do you

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,760
have a conversation about doing

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,360
repetitive work that can't be automated

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,520
so i touched on this a little bit in the

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,120
talk but if you could find someone to

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,120
be as a backup that would be ideal

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,120
maybe you can share the load with um

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,559
with that other person or other people

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,159
make sure that what you're doing is

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,960
documented so that other people can do

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,080
it

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,440
um i'm gonna try to get to one or two

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,320
more questions here hopefully that's

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,600
helpful

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,200
um uh one other question here about

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,799
setting boundaries particularly when we

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,919
have virtual conferences and virtual

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,919
meetings all day

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,320
um i think it's really easy just to get

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,799
distracted and pulled back into work so

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,240
um i know when i'm doing conferences

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,440
like this i just communicate with my

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,760
team that hey

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,760
i'd like to spend the majority of my day

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,080
doing some training at this conference

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,279
and just letting people know what my

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,440
availability is

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,279
obviously emergencies come up and buyers

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,039
come up but do your best

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,840
in advance to um to do that

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,679
if you can easier said than done uh i'm

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,240
gonna stop there uh we're almost out of

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,159
time

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,279
but um i'll head over to slack and hang

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,520
out for a little while

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,799
and i hope you enjoyed the talk and i

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,360
hope you learned something from it and

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,200
can

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:14,159
and please share this with other people

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:14,159
