[Music]

00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,210
okay so there's gonna be my letting talk

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,789
it's gonna be real quick

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,369
so that's a lightning talk right so to

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,279
be good so just to start off I just want

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,939
to introduce myself my name's Eric sabe

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,050
I am a senior software engineer for

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,029
desert eBook

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,430
I'm also a member of the solidus core

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,340
team and you can find me online

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,250
everywhere at Eric's Ave that's just

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,860
where I am so today really I just kind

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,620
of want to talk about Deseret books next

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,579
big project which is that we're going to

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:51,090
be writing our own point-of-sale system

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:54,510
yeah so we're terrified but it's going

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,520
to be it's gonna be powered by solidus

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,440
in a way so when I talk about

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,199
point-of-sale what I'm talking about is

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,539
the is the thing in the middle the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,430
actual point where people are touching

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,619
and scanning things that's the software

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,799
that we're going to be writing and it

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,630
needs to you know interact with payment

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,100
terminals it needs to interact with

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,140
peripherals like the scanner and the

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,360
receipt printer we need authentication

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,360
to make sure that the people using it

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,780
are actual real people and then it needs

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,220
some kind of like e-commerce back-end or

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,079
at least some kind of system that can

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,110
give us pricing coupons and promos

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,780
everything and they're gonna be run on

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,320
iPads so we're gonna run it with a react

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,790
PWA is kind of the current goal I have

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,820
another that there's a JavaScript

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,220
toolbox that allows us for to use like

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,470
reusable code joel touched on that

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,310
earlier when he introduced the solidus

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,780
sdk that is what we'll be using to

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,299
communicate with solidus through this

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,390
whole thing and it's actually been a

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,110
really good tool so if I ever talk about

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,640
toolbox I'm talking about a mono repo of

00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:08,459
JavaScript SDKs that we use to do this

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,480
kind of thing so it's gonna be racked up

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,680
it will use solidus to handle pricing

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,069
sales

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,159
taxes I mean you know anything that's

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,019
related to actual selling the product we

00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,510
were gonna use AWS kognito and Azure

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:26,909
Active Directory because IT uses Azure

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,280
Active Directory and we like AWS so we

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,299
had to figure that out then we have

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,970
payment terminals that will actually

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:36,510
take the payment and Bluetooth scanner

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,099
and printer so solidus is gonna do all

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,840
this I just talked about that really the

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,819
whole goal of solidus though is just to

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,500
be sort of like the order ledger it will

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,180
power the things too like calculate

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,010
price but at the end of the day we're

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,440
just kind of like recording sales in

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,629
solidus is our current design everything

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,540
that I'm telling you today is like super

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,280
early days but this is I just wanted to

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,739
kind of introduce this big project that

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,840
we're working on here's our current

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,000
architecture that we're thinking about

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,900
going with we're trying to separate out

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,810
things as much as we can for security

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:13,530
the stores are all sectioned off into

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,120
their own little area then they only

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,630
communicate with a point-of-sale

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,700
back-end that's separate from our

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,919
current ecommerce back-end they'll be

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,880
the same stack but they'll be separate

00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:29,400
just so that if the point-of-sale stack

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,040
goes down it doesn't affect online and

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,859
vice-versa we communicate with our

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,269
payment terminal processor over the

00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,980
internet obviously and then we're also

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:42,959
going to record the the transaction

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,910
responses in s3 so this is like a really

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,000
generic diagram of kind of how we're

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,799
doing it and I just like everything that

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,769
I've said is pretty new and fresh and

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,180
we're currently it it works I guess is

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,859
what I'm saying we actually have the

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,500
point-of-sale running it interacts with

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:01,230
solidus it calculates tax it initiates

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,120
transactions we can communicate with our

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,989
payment terminal and record the

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,459
transaction in solidus with that

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:11,430
response so everything is actually

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,049
working right now but only successes we

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,569
haven't we haven't done the edge cases

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,099
for for errors yet so the next basis is

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,349
that we really want we have to pass the

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:22,049
certification for our payment terminal

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:24,349
stuff we need to overcome any solidus

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,159
hurdles like right now it's calculating

00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,500
shipping and we don't need it to

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,580
calculate shipping but that's

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,010
like one of the things that we need to

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,290
figure out then we're gonna put it into

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,360
our downtown retail store and do like

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,330
you know just a few small transactions

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,500
we're gonna use it at a pop-up event and

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,600
so that's that's pretty much it

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,720
but what I do want to say is if anybody

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,760
has any experience with point-of-sales

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,470
or is interested in the craziness that

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,840
we're doing please come talk to me

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,230
because I'm interested to talk to you so

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,480
that's that thank you

00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:05,630
I'm Matthew bass I work for candle

00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:07,310
science and okay we ship candle making

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,100
supplies all over the country

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,480
everything from wicks in envelopes all

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,180
the way up to entire truckloads of wax

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:18,310
so we have to do a lot of shipping

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,980
quotes and we want to do them fast and

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,710
hitting the UPS API doesn't always work

00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,280
sometimes it goes down and when it goes

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,419
down

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,360
we can't quote rates to to our customers

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:35,330
so we needed a fast way to do that so we

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,790
decided caching was one option but of

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,890
course that's not always going to work

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,280
when you have so many different possible

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:47,060
addresses so what we came up with was a

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,570
system that we dubbed Luke for a local

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,930
UPS quoting and we basically took we

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:59,660
created a non API calculator and we took

00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:03,530
oh it's not even showing up all right

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:06,400
give me a minute all right so we created

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,960
this non API a calculator it's just a

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,210
calculator like any other for the

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,169
compute package method we are calling

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:20,180
this luke service that we wrote and it

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:23,300
looks like this so basically what we did

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,950
was we took a bunch of the data that UPS

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,260
publishes on their website they publish

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,570
an entire table with shipping rates and

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,580
shipping zones and surcharges all that

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,169
kind of stuff and we wrote some break

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,349
tasks that suck all that into our

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:39,200
database and so then all we have to do

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:41,320
is you know find the shipping zone based

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,090
on the address that the customer

00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,310
we iterate over all the packages in

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,810
their shipment we calculate billable

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,950
weight we do that

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,830
taking dimensional weight into accounts

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:58,390
its ups charges extra for for large

00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:02,560
light packages and and then we look up a

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:04,900
shipping rate in our table and and we're

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,570
pretty much done down here we sum up the

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,820
the base rate along with the residential

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,690
surcharge the peak surcharge all those

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:17,280
other surcharges the EPS tax on and we

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:20,980
come up with a rate that we return and

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,530
display to the customer and it's really

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,870
fast and we don't have to rely on the

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,570
API so the API can go down as much as it

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,210
wants to and what we do is to check our

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,970
work at the very end when the customer

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,520
has placed their order asynchronously in

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:40,630
a background job we hit the UPS API

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,250
query with all the same data and check

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,010
that the rate that they give us matches

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,350
what we calculated and if it doesn't

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,270
then we flag it and send ourselves an

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,740
email to investigate but it's been

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:55,210
working pretty well we built a similar

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,820
system for the post office and you know

00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:01,240
this is what this is what the Rays task

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:05,260
looks like to import the rates table it

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:09,669
just calls out to this parser which does

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,860
a bunch of complicated parsing stuff

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:15,400
because the file that UPS provides kind

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,380
of sucks but yeah that's it if you have

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:23,620
any questions or want to talk about any

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:25,510
more just hit me up Thanks ok cool shape

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:30,610
you know where this organization with

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:35,250
the right reports I'm Rob Kellis VP

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:38,409
digital for book and first observation

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:42,880
when you're a steward a data steward for

00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:46,230
a business you're an influencer and when

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,080
I first joined a book you know I was

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,630
given PG admin and said hey people need

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,310
reports just go query the database and

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,500
it would be like a recurring

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,090
and it was annoying as can be and this

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,420
wasn't a legacy system before he went on

00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:04,410
a spree and I got really sick of it so I

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,650
just made my own reporting system that

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:12,190
people can can go to and there's lots of

00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:14,080
different things on here and I soon

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,750
realized that not only did this make my

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:23,260
job a whole lot easier it also started

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:26,050
to direct the way people think so you

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,550
know we all have a lot of data with

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,470
solidus and with our e-commerce

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,089
platforms and there's a lot there's a

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:35,470
lot of good you can do in your business

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:37,480
with that an observation number two is

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,430
people who need a report often can't

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,279
communicate what information they really

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,110
need it's actually kind of like an

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,110
interview process when people say hey I

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,220
need a report I just need this and

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,120
before you know it what you're making

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:56,440
for them is completely different so an

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,720
example is the business only reports on

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,360
booked revenue which requires orders to

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,250
be shipped my problem is I don't know

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,560
the impact back orders are having on our

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,000
bookable revenue I want to know how much

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,920
revenue is at stake

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,750
and so we had this like really

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,160
interesting middle ground we have we

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:17,290
actually have 60,000 saleable SKUs and

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,810
we have a bunch of orders coming and

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,060
going we have a warehouse that's 40,000

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,940
square-foot and there's a lot of

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,270
back-and-forth going with with our

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,850
orders we have a supply chain team who

00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:34,030
are trying to get things we have a whole

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,650
bunch of problems but they have trying

00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,970
to reorder a product that's going out of

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,490
stock and there's a bunch of problems

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,459
and so the question was hey I just want

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,650
to know how much revenue is in you know

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,400
any given time how much revenue is on

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,030
backorder

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,850
so instead of just coming up with a

00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:54,160
query and saying this much revenue I

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,020
through a report on that was able to

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,350
help people kind of explore what's going

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:02,440
on right so I had to redact this for

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:05,350
obvious reasons but what you can do is

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,520
you can choose a time period of time and

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,860
you can look and see

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,540
the fulfillment state is overview by

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,010
stock location and we have lots of

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,590
different stock locations but the main

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,050
ones is desert book which is our

00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,760
warehouse we have digital which

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,070
everything gets fulfilled immediately

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,870
and then we have the call the call

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,380
center as well which do fulfill things

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,850
as well so what I did is I I kind of

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,570
broke that all out so you can kind of

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:34,400
see the quantity sales average price per

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,710
unit estimated cost cost is an

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,530
interesting one because our metrics are

00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:42,500
gauged off margin which is pretty

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,380
typical for retail and then you can jump

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:50,090
in to each fulfillment status by stock

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,950
location and you can look and see you

00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:56,300
know what particular products are

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:58,850
holding things back so you can see how

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,190
much quantity has been backordered what

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,730
sales that accounts for how many orders

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,440
this impacts and then look at the count

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,750
on hand for what you have right now for

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,840
that even though it's on back order and

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:14,240
then you can view the orders and our CSR

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,280
our team customer success team can go in

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,380
and if they see some things that

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,870
actually won't be back ordered which

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,600
happens more frequently than we'd like

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,870
they can go in and view the orders and

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,040
quickly send those guys an email saying

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:34,430
sorry so my this is my only real point

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,900
is that when developers only deliver and

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,280
what was asked of them

00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:42,250
the results are worse and that's really

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,960
a there's some examples of what happens

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:50,270
when all you do is deliver and what's

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:51,740
asked of you so that's it thank you I

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,180
just wanna give a quick intro to myself

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,370
for those you don't know me my name is

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,550
Gregor MacDougall I have been a member

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:00,590
of the solidus core team since day zero

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:04,220
with me is Alberto Vania you want to

00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:06,710
introduce yourself yeah hi I'm Alberto

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,010
Vina I am co-founder of nabla and one of

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:11,990
the core team members we're here just to

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,970
talk a little bit about in a not quite

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,040
so lightening talk a little bit about

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,110
the solvers roadmap that's upcoming I

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,120
did want to mention some other things

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,920
before we get started

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm really into Mario maker right now so

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,980
if you have any Mario maker levels that

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,930
you want world record set on please

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,330
message me and solve in the solidus

00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,210
slack I will do my best on my plane ride

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,980
home we're really happy to be out here

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,779
for Salt Lake City for first solidus

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,330
confident one of the things that's been

00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:41,300
coming up recently in the community is

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,470
what do we do where do we go where do we

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,450
go from here

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,779
solidus has made a lot of progress in

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,029
the years and years since it first began

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,680
we've stabilized the platform we've done

00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,450
a lot of work in order to improve the

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,300
lives of people who are running stores

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,100
on a daily basis but I don't think any

00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,180
of us in this room are currently happy

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,640
with a hundred percent of everything

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,320
that Solo's does we need to try and

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,930
continue to improve the platform

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,850
continue to evolve the platform and take

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,760
this platform to a state where it is not

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,020
a platform that's going to stay and it

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,810
brings us to a point that we want to be

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,940
in the future so with the core team

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,860
combined with us the various ambassadors

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,930
and stakeholders on the project have

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,910
been coming up with a solidus roadmap

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,200
that we're here to give you a little bit

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,010
of a teaser on the first things that

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,810
we're going to be looking at

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:32,810
implementing yeah this is the process

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:35,170
that we've done to create tasks for the

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:40,270
roadmap

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,270
well we firstly analyzed market trends

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:47,050
which are basically buzzwords that we we

00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:50,089
will listen to during next year's and

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:54,339
for example for the admin there's the

00:14:50,089 --> 00:15:01,180
this trend of introducing Atlas CMS or

00:14:54,339 --> 00:15:05,060
gdpr for the Europe for Europe and I

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:09,130
eighteen and rapper stuff or for example

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:12,890
other other software business growth

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:18,610
which are probably things that will not

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:22,570
be really used by everyone but will be

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:26,740
will be some important factors when

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:28,820
people choose which path them to use and

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,350
just just one go back to that one just

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,240
very sec I just want to reiterate on

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,769
this one is that a lot of these things

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,569
that are features in here these are

00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,129
key things that some people need other

00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:39,319
people don't care about but these are

00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:41,059
key differentiating decisions is that if

00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:43,069
I'm looking at platforms and I'm looking

00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:45,769
at solidus versus something else and I

00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:47,209
see that this solidus supports what it

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,949
supports and this other thing supports

00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,230
most of the things that so Lotus does

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:53,779
plus it supports modern payment methods

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,639
subscriptions and voice search these are

00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:57,199
the types of things that developers

00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,079
decision-makers and people who are

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,100
looking for looking for the next

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,929
platform that they're going to be

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,249
developing if they see something that

00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,799
supports some of these things where

00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:08,209
solidus looks like it's fallen behind in

00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,610
this regard they're gonna choose the

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:12,259
other platform these are the key things

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,639
that I think that you look at some of

00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,809
these things we've had a lot of talks

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,239
about some of the things like voice

00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:18,889
search and how important that is for SEO

00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:21,649
how important this is for driving your

00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:25,059
sales that if we can find ways to be

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:27,230
able to allow solidus to continue on

00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:29,540
adding its functionality in order to

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,119
meet some of these key differentiating

00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,439
points that will allow us to further

00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:36,679
differentiate ourselves for the

00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:38,600
competition and other platforms that

00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:40,399
people might be looking to use and make

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,559
solidus a more appealing target for

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,929
people to continue to adopt as well as a

00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:50,299
more appealing platform for people who

00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:52,519
are already using solidus from the tech

00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:54,619
side as well again we've had talks about

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,839
progressive web applications

00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:59,240
you know API driven stuff this is all

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,040
the the key things that are important

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,110
for our developer point of views in

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,770
order to make solidus allow us to

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,360
develop the types of websites that are

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,539
desired today by people who are looking

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,949
to provide a storefront when Spri was

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,130
first designed and once all this was

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,470
first fort the entire web was a very

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,470
different space people browsed on

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,689
desktops on big giant CRT monitors or

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,850
something like that people now don't use

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:28,069
the web the same way so much of the

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,450
traffic is on mobile if you have ever

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,100
looked at the analytics of your store

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,110
I'm sure you're probably as surprised as

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,549
me like hang out what percentage of our

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,889
people are coming onto the sing from our

00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:39,549
mobile from their mobile device it still

00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:41,809
shocks me every day I look at it this is

00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:43,909
continuing to adapt our tech in order to

00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:46,100
be able to make solidus even more

00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:47,630
relevant for the modern web is one of

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,040
the the biggest things that we can

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:56,660
focus on in the near future yeah then we

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:58,760
analyze the market size and we we've

00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,210
taken into account this blog post which

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,050
is very valid for pipe candy which has

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:09,310
been updated this year so it's probably

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:14,780
very valid and we we found out that

00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:18,730
there's the the biggest part of the

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:22,420
share is taken by a smaller store with

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:26,750
which to less than 1 million yearly

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:33,140
while the distribution continued with

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:40,880
other other stores that are are less but

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:44,720
do more and we we try to calculate how

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:48,830
much this revenue could be and we've

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,350
taken an optimistic approach for a

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:54,250
smaller store by multiplying the number

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,380
of companies in in that block by the

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,240
[Music]

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:04,280
upper bound of the range so 1 million

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,560
and doing a pessimistic approach for the

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:12,290
other plots so this is the worst

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:17,270
scenario scenario for solids and what

00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:20,450
what we found out is that the the

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:26,020
revenue for a smaller store are less

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:30,470
than the revenue for a bigger one and

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:32,690
solidus easier right now the average

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:39,670
revenue for solid news stories is there

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:42,920
and we taken this number from our client

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:46,420
from this our service that we submitted

00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:51,350
into the slack channel sometime ago and

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:53,150
from online financial statements also

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:58,840
from our com.com

00:19:53,150 --> 00:20:01,420
data and one important

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:06,250
- to say is that we only considered

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:11,440
stores that do 100% web sale so data

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:15,430
should be should be free from that I've

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:19,590
loved a lot of physical point-of-sale

00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:25,150
and so what we can say from from these

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:30,490
things we have a lot of opportunities in

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:33,910
that in that part of the market because

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:37,990
a lot of revenues are are coming from

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:42,400
there and we we probably done done AB

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:45,010
the the resource resource to compete -

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:51,700
with with platforms that are targeting

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:53,770
smaller so so I like to think that we

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:59,530
are not doing wrong and it's ok to

00:20:53,770 --> 00:21:02,020
target big stores for solidus but we

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:06,280
still have to discover which field which

00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:09,600
features do they want and if they if big

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:14,740
stores that right now are on that

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,250
revenue average started with less than 1

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,160
million

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:25,840
so should we add feature - solidus that

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:29,530
tries to target also those kind of

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:34,030
stores and and hope that they grow until

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:38,260
they they they became perfect for first

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:43,450
a perfect match with solidus we also

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:46,570
analyze competitors and we we split

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:50,560
comparison into two blocks direct and

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:54,460
indirect director open source not

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:59,370
software's the service platforms sign

00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:03,640
with focus on code quality community and

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:09,370
and customization in mind and these

00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:11,170
compilers are the one listed and the

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:16,590
indirect are

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:23,410
one there as a pricing model or our

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:26,770
software is a service so we compiled a

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:30,220
list of features that they have don't

00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:37,420
try to read them for for some reason

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:42,940
it's also in Italian so anyway we spit

00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:48,130
official into four categories and we try

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:50,740
to analyze all those platforms and of

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,470
course we we can consider all the

00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,730
features in there because it's

00:22:53,470 --> 00:23:01,419
impossible to compare and create

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,720
something similar for solids we have to

00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:10,320
choose we have to focus on something and

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:15,809
we we have done some stupid formula on

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:19,720
Excel basically if the the number of

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:24,309
indirect competitors is more than four

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:27,130
or the number of direct competitor is

00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:32,650
more than one will take into account at

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:40,660
Fischer that's the basic the basic idea

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:43,740
one example is communicating the success

00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:46,690
stories or case studies we have nine in

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,990
indirect competitors doing that and for

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:53,770
direct competitor doing that so let's

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:57,400
take it multi sales channel and on my

00:23:53,770 --> 00:24:03,220
channels support to indirect competitors

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:05,710
and zero direct so let's not take it but

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,970
let's try not to make this process too

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:15,179
robotic because we have to put some gut

00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:20,440
feeling in there and so for example free

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:22,320
the demo on the website we are for

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,030
indirect that

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:29,790
that do that and one direct but we think

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:34,170
that is no brain doing that so we'll

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:38,790
take it anyway or another example is

00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:42,330
time store team teamster we have seven

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:46,560
indirect competitors doing that and zero

00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:48,420
direct but we so we should take that but

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:54,420
we're not going to take that because we

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:57,240
don't want teams in our platforms please

00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,370
sure this is just a bit of a teaser for

00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,980
where we're gonna be going in the future

00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,660
and how we've chosen to do this I say we

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,310
I should mention that Alberto did all

00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,180
the work on this and I'm just here to

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,910
take credit for it

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,200
so you know I personally accept your

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,660
thanks if you're a very happy with what

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,280
you've seen so far but this is a

00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,950
starting point for what we're gonna be

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,180
discussing over the next few days next

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,580
few weeks and months and things like

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,070
that tomorrow at ten o'clock

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,110
we're gonna be having a meeting of any

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,420
of the people who are interested

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,310
involved in the future of solidus to be

00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,290
able to go over what we've defined as a

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,230
starting point for the roadmap what

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,460
we're looking for are people to offer

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,370
suggestions and contributions for things

00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,320
that we should focus on first things

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,790
that are less important things that we

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,500
forgot about that definitely need to be

00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,940
on there and even more importantly than

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,290
that things that are important for you

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,790
and your business right now that you

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:50,460
would be willing to say you know what I

00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,450
really want this or I have 80% of this

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,060
that I'm willing to share with the

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,540
community right now we can work on this

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,250
together

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,020
over the hack days over the next two

00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,370
days or whether they're coming weeks and

00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,600
months as we continue to try and bring

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:07,770
this a the progress of this platform

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:12,270
forward yeah so we to create this task

00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:17,730
which are an initial draft of the

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:20,910
roadmap we have taken items from from

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:25,680
all these analysis that we've done and

00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:30,150
we created a Trello board with we don't

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:33,660
ask we you can you can take a look at

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,120
the roadmap I can share the link even

00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:39,230
right now or we can

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,140
tomorrow better anyway there's a lot of

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:44,809
a lot of tasks in there

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:48,530
yeah we'll we'll talk tomorrow better

00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:51,620
how to prioritize them and integrate

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,300
more tasks that make sense for the

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,400
community

00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,980
yeah Alberto has a lot of work to be

00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,150
that he put into analyzing the results

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,800
from the survey that we talked about

00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,510
we're gonna go over all that tomorrow

00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,850
ready to go over the roadmap in detail

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:07,370
I'd love to have your input even just to

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,540
be there listen learn about what we want

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,150
to do with the platform going forward

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,350
and you know thanks to Alberto and all

00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,710
the team at maybe a lab for putting this

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,240
together

00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,820
I think say anybody who responded to the

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,020
survey and I hope that we're putting

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,880
together a roadmap that's going to

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,790
define the future of solidus that brings

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,740
the platform to the place where we all

00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,740
want it to be thank you

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:42,729
[Applause]
