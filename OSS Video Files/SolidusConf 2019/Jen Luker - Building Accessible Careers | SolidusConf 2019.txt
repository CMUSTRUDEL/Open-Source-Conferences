Description: 
	Jen Luker speaks about accessibility in the workplace.

"Building Accessible Careers"
There has been a huge push for accessibility to be part of external websites, but what about the internal tools we use every day? I’ll go over the reasons internal accessibility is important, where to start, and how small improvements can have a big impact on increasing diversity in our workplaces.

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,549
[Music]

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,710
[Applause]

00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:18,449
hackers I was a nerd when I was a kid I

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,820
used to use tell that to hack in the

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,609
University of Utah to connect to people

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,010
that we're in Sydney Australia actually

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,449
way back when the internet was brand-new

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:33,110
so when hackers came out and they're

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:36,989
like don't do hacking I'm like why not

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,910
so building accessible careers this is a

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:45,239
little bit of a deviation from my

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:47,640
standard accessibility talk so we're

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,449
gonna start with this it's a little bit

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,920
of a kick so imagine you're in a job

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,600
interview and they tell you I'm sorry we

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,930
can't even interview you because our

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,670
system requires a phone screen but

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,390
you're deaf and we don't really know how

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,090
to handle like any of those deaf systems

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,710
that you use for phones so you know

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,119
anything you're on the phone a lot like

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:21,810
talking to people

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:23,700
so we just we can't hire you and while

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,400
you're thinking about that as you saw

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,680
before my name is Jen Luger and because

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:35,930
this talk comes with a kick I do have a

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:37,770
disclaimer it's mine so accessibility

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,590
people have always wondered what the

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,320
a11y stands for and the 11 characters or

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,369
the 11 letters in between a and why our

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,130
what make up the 11 and a 11 why the

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:54,630
same goes for internationalization I 18

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,070
ñ or kubernetes k8s there's that many

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,189
letters in between the first and last

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,680
letter and the reason this came about

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,570
was because of Twitter when you had only

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,530
140 characters you had to keep things

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,280
very succinct

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:13,110
you couldn't spend 20 characters on a

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,890
word like internationalization so that's

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,900
a little bit about why

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,490
that came from so what is accessibility

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,070
an accessibility is people with

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,530
disabilities can perceive understand

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,870
navigate and interact with websites and

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,280
tools and they can contribute equally

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:36,720
without barriers so when we're talking

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,470
about going to a job and you're in a

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,410
wheelchair or you have crutches the

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:48,330
ability to get there is an accessibility

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,770
concern the ability to talk to people to

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,420
answer a phone when you're waiting for

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:59,010
job interviews is an accessibility

00:02:51,420 --> 00:03:00,510
concern the ability to learn through the

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:07,860
ways that many of us do through Stack

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:10,470
Overflow or through Deb dogs are all

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:17,459
accessibility concerns and so is

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:18,870
purchasing so what is it disability when

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,450
a person is denied access to a

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,760
technology barrier the impairment to

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,340
their ability did not occur because the

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,970
body's limitations rather the defect

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,510
occurred in the technology so when

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,890
someone can't do something it's not

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,780
because of the limitation in their body

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:42,630
it's because we've not developed the

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:45,900
technology to make it possible it's not

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,440
the person's fault it's the technology

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,440
assault

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:58,350
we have elevators we have screen readers

00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:00,620
we have keyboards we have ramps we have

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,620
Braille

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,900
and when we talk about diversities

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,150
oftentimes I think about the permanent

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,420
disability is deafness blindness missing

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:17,109
a limb in a wheelchair but there's also

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:21,250
temporary impairments like breaking an

00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:25,270
arm having your eyes dilated and eardrum

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,250
burst because you were sick and then

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,290
there's situational limitations like

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,840
trying to watch a video in a really

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:38,470
noisy place like a bar or a family

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:42,850
reunion or the mice for Apple has the

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:48,930
plug at the bottom so you can't exactly

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:52,620
charge an use these are all situational

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,760
disabilities situational impairments and

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,740
though you may have heard of those three

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,540
a lot there's others that people don't

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,030
often talk about or don't often consider

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,540
for instance age-related impairments

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:07,000
these things happen slowly over time

00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,970
people have been able to see things just

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,400
fine but they're starting to squint

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,660
they're starting to need reading glasses

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,600
or they're not able to move around quite

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:22,000
as quickly as they used to climbing

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:24,490
stairs is getting harder there's also

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,910
age-related impairments as in they can't

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:31,390
reach a shelf because there's three it

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,880
goes both directions maybe they don't

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:37,450
have the mental capacity at this point

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,410
to be able to understand something maybe

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:45,370
they can't read yet maybe they're from a

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:50,910
different country multiple disabilities

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,910
not everyone has just one disability

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,360
just because you are in a wheelchair

00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:00,970
does not mean you cannot be blind as

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:03,580
well or deaf just because you have

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:11,590
anxiety doesn't mean you can't also be

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:13,570
suffering from OCD so trying to adapt

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,969
our technology to handle not just one

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:20,949
disability but combinations of this

00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:23,699
abilities can get really complex there's

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,569
also health conditions like pregnancy

00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,619
you know these things will resolve

00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:34,059
themselves in nine months but it makes

00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:36,459
it really hard to drive or move near the

00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,689
end there there's a fair amount of

00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:43,139
illness that tends to happen in the

00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:46,809
beginning I mean when I was pregnant and

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:51,699
working as a dev I pare programmed with

00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:55,089
someone and I did most of the high-level

00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:58,239
strategy and my pair did a lot of the

00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:59,709
actual coding because I could run off to

00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:02,110
the bathroom whenever I needed to and

00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:06,669
come back and still be a productive

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:09,579
member of the team sometimes it's not

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:15,189
the technology but the process that

00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:17,110
needs to adapt and then there's changing

00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:18,789
abilities like my daughter who has a

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,800
neurological condition where some days

00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,899
she's perfectly fine and other days

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,469
she's in so much pain she can barely

00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:31,539
move and when she does it's to pass out

00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:33,759
or vomit people have good days people

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,289
have bad days just because they're

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,139
having a bad day today does not mean

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,129
they can't have a good day tomorrow and

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,050
just because they could walk yesterday

00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:49,179
doesn't mean that wheelchair isn't

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:51,219
necessary today so when we're looking at

00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:56,709
numbers we're talking about 61 million

00:07:51,219 --> 00:08:03,189
adults in the USA alone 26 percent of

00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:07,869
adults one in four that doesn't even

00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:09,459
include the children and adults without

00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:11,799
disabilities that are caring for those

00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,239
children or adults with disabilities

00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:17,259
that are caring for those children with

00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:20,039
disabilities as well that's a lot of

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,039
people

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,670
Jennifer Kat van had this amazing quote

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,350
react rally a few years ago I would say

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,040
like 90% of your day is dictated by

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:36,680
technology and if you as a person are

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:42,770
not included in that technology what's

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:47,590
the point of the app is fast if you

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:52,400
cannot even use it what else matters

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:58,940
that the code is clean that it's

00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:01,220
open-source that it's fast that it loads

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:06,470
very quickly that the build size or

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:11,750
bundle size is small doesn't matter if

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:13,490
it doesn't work if someone was unable to

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,170
get through the purchase process you'd

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,710
be hot fixing that so fast heads would

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,270
spin so why is it different when someone

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:26,510
with a disability can't get through the

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:27,890
purchase process why is it a bug when

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,680
you can't go through the purchase

00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:37,430
process but it's a feature when someone

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:39,800
who's color blind can part of a problem

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,390
I feel around accessibility is that the

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,340
industry itself so focused on

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,310
accessibility being extra features on

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,230
top of things or yeah but this ways

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,730
faster we'll get to it when we get to it

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,140
when we get big enough when we have

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,350
enough people that are actually looking

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,030
at our websites when we have enough

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:57,410
people that are buying things or it

00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,090
doesn't really apply to me because I

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,920
sell rainbows of blind people don't

00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,280
really buy rainbows because they can't

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,600
see them but last I checked blind people

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,480
had families and not all of them are

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:16,250
blind maybe they're buying their needs a

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:17,630
rainbow maybe their uncle and I want to

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,480
go back a few slides and look at this in

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:24,260
America

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:29,720
26% of adults do you know how many

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:36,170
websites are accessible less than one in

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:38,450
ten that means that if your webs

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:43,760
is accessible you could corner the

00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:46,269
market that's 26 percent of the

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:56,300
population you could potentially reach

00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:58,820
but others can't not only that but when

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,820
you make websites accessible you're

00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,279
improving the process for everyone like

00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,519
the person sitting in a bar using

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,889
subtitles they're not usually deaf but

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,899
in this situation they're helpful or

00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,490
maybe the baby sleeping or maybe you're

00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,050
tired of that thing where the explosions

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,959
are so loud they're deafening but the

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,630
volume of the speech is so quiet you're

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,980
constantly like you know up and down in

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,600
this volume trying to make a function

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,600
make sometimes subtitles are just nice

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,310
so not only are you making this process

00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,050
easier and the flow easier for people

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,389
with accessibility but you're also

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,490
making it easier for everybody else

00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:38,930
which means they're more likely to make

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,709
it through your flow process because

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,470
they're not getting annoyed either so

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:48,170
not only are you cornering a market but

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,019
you're making it easier for everyone and

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,589
I don't know about you but when it comes

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:56,079
time for you know repeat purchases I go

00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,980
back to the site that was easy

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,000
the one where I didn't have to jump

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,459
through a bunch of Hoops the one that

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,760
made sense that explained things when I

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,760
needed it that I could tab through

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:15,490
really fast to the parts that I wanted

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,490
or use my arrow keys to skip entire rows

00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:23,959
and if you're thinking for a moment

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,910
throwing out numbers that you have like

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:29,300
a ten million dollar company and you

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,819
access this twenty six percent if you

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,029
add that twenty five percent that's a

00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:36,829
twelve and a half million dollar company

00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:41,360
but this is twenty five percent of the

00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:43,760
entire US not just your little tiny

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,930
market share and if they're coming to

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,060
you because they can't go anywhere else

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,060
that could be double triple quadruple

00:12:49,820 --> 00:13:00,320
what you're currently doing but there's

00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,700
a downside to that too and we're gonna

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,320
go back to that in a moment but we're

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,180
going to deviate a little bit to this

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,070
question of we talked about web

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:14,960
accessibility for users but what about

00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:16,430
employees I've never heard this set can

00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,440
you please hold while I find someone

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:24,280
sighted who can use the admin tool to

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:28,010
reset your password my question there is

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:31,820
have I never heard this because their

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:42,200
internal tool is accessible or because

00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:44,420
they don't hire blind people so the

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,870
Americans with Disability Act of 1990

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,100
you know we've talked heard pretty much

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,390
know about this but I really wanted to

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,680
walk you through this for just a moment

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:56,150
because this has some interesting

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:59,090
caveats ok there's reasonable

00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,470
accommodation any change in the work

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,870
environment or in the way things are

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,080
usually done processes to help a person

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,300
with a disability applied for a job

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,590
perform the duties of a job and enjoy

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,860
the benefits and privileges of

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,900
employment enjoying the benefits and

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,880
privileges of employment think about

00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,470
that for a second imagine if we had more

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:24,170
people with disabilities as debts I mean

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,130
we do make a fair amount of money and we

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,460
have pretty good health insurance

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,250
coverage and we have flexibility

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,500
depending on where you work but

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,600
sometimes work from home or go to the

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:43,040
kids soccer thing or go to the doctor's

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:46,850
appointment you have twice a week one in

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:51,500
three people with disabilities do not

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:54,380
have a usual health care provider one of

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,350
the three adults with disabilities don't

00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:03,700
have enough health coverage one in four

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,700
don't even bother going to the doctor

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:14,990
who could benefit more from the money

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:21,140
the health coverage and the flexibility

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:23,180
than people with disabilities in fact a

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,620
reasonable accommodation the law

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,630
requires an employer to provide

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,490
reasonable accommodation to an employee

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,940
or job applicant with a disability

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:35,990
unless doing so would cause significant

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,750
difficulty or expense to the employer if

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:43,100
it is too complicated and too expensive

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:51,290
to make something accessible they don't

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:53,420
have to now in a player may not refuse

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:57,940
to provide an accommodation just because

00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:00,650
it involves some cost but it's some cost

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,540
they don't have to provide the exact

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,300
accommodation the employer job applicant

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,410
wants if there's more than one option

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,670
it's up to the employer to choose and

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:15,190
you bet you they're choosing the cheaper

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,190
one not the best one the cheaper one

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,589
an employer does not have to provide

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:36,329
accommodation if doing so would cause

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:37,889
undue hardship to the employer this may

00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,779
not necessarily apply to the really big

00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:48,899
box stores but this applies to the

00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:50,670
smaller ones it supplies to us I'm sorry

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,619
but the CMS is not accessible to someone

00:16:50,670 --> 00:17:03,480
with your disabilities we can't hire you

00:16:52,619 --> 00:17:07,020
at this time if your internal tools and

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,569
processes are not accessible you may be

00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,039
providing your employer legal protection

00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,039
against hiring people with disabilities

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:21,480
if people with disabilities cannot use

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:25,350
your CMS your admin tools your customer

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:29,159
service tools your sales tools and it's

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:30,960
too expensive to make them so or they

00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:36,240
can justify that it's too expensive to

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,340
make them so they don't have to and

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,500
therefore they won't hire people with

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,309
those disabilities which means the

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:50,610
diversity in our teams may include

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:58,020
gender sexual orientation race but not

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:59,970
abilities so there's some resources as

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,950
far as moving towards this accessibility

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,090
thing that can help get you started and

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,610
some of these things are really

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:08,370
relatively small I'm not trying to

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,659
browbeat you into it has to be perfect

00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,820
compliance because there is no such

00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:15,570
thing some things contradict like

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,490
someone with autism can't handle bright

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,110
contrasting colors but someone with

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,070
colorblindness has to have bright

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:24,840
contrasting colors you know so sometimes

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,640
those things contradict and they can be

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,380
a lot of work to try to get down into

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,350
the nitty gritties so what I'm asking

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,490
you to do is the best that you can and I

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,480
want to break this down into some

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:38,190
smaller two pieces so first here's the

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,900
accessibility resources to help

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:45,150
and I'm not sending you to the really

00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,100
complicated I don't understand what this

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,950
reads that for my 13th time through

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,900
conversations these are much smaller

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,000
bite-sized pieces that make sense these

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,400
are written by people that want to help

00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,730
you not written by people that are

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:06,540
trying to write a code of some sort and

00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:11,580
you have Crowell which means you have

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:13,800
lighthouse and lighthouse also has an

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,050
accessibility score for both mobile apps

00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,190
and full-sized apps you can check this

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,640
today and it does give you some

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,640
information regarding what some problems

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,210
are how you may fix it but it does tend

00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,010
to be a little bit more limited so what

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:34,230
I do recommend is the acts Chrome and

00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:34,860
Firefox extensions ax is bigger and

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,600
deeper than that

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,180
they have ax core which is what

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,040
lighthouse uses you can also take ax

00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,590
core itself and plug it into any of your

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,570
testing Suites to test for accessibility

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,050
on the fly you can do it your unit

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:52,260
testing your end end testing and it

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:55,620
gives you a starting point the reason

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,320
why I like ax though is because of the

00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:01,740
fact that it gives you much more

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:04,740
detailed information regarding why it's

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:08,310
wrong and what you can do to fix it with

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,870
multiple alternatives sometimes you can

00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,660
go for the quick easy fix but you don't

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:15,720
have time to dig down into the deeper

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:22,520
guts to fix it in a more thorough

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,520
fashion that's fine do what you can so

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:30,150
when we're looking at this and I did use

00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,680
solar design for my example here 47

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,700
issues you know and that's thought of

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,420
issues when you're just looking at the

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:40,170
number and I've seen some that are 135

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:41,490
360 lots of issues right but don't let

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,940
these numbers scare you a lot of these

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:47,190
are clustered a lot of these are grouped

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,730
so I'm gonna walk you through how we can

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,730
start

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,730
when I want you to do is start with your

00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,460
definition have done start with you I

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,050
want you to decide today that no more

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,520
code will go past you without at least a

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:14,350
basic accessibility check use a button

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:17,650
not a div use a main tag where it's

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:21,100
applicable use the nav tag where it's

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:27,840
applicable don't use your headers as

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:27,840
styling use them as ordered hierarchies

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:37,180
there's always code bases that exist

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,590
they're big they're wonky there's no

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,000
such thing as a perfectly clean code

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,280
base except for one that we just started

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,890
today and we're all we did was like

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,910
install the CLI and that was it

00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,830
everything after that it gets to be

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:51,970
messy

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:54,460
so trying to go again for look at all

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:57,580
the compliance we have to go for is too

00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,770
much look at all the stuff we have to do

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:03,670
from all the past stuff I don't even

00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:07,780
know how that stuff works so just start

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:12,100
today with your code with your PRS that

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,420
you review I mean we almost mindlessly

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,530
go through those PRS and go yeah yeah

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,260
I'll do that I'll do that I'll do that

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:20,020
I'll do that so if you say can convert

00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:26,380
this over to a button they'll just go

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:30,250
Yap sure I can do it but every single

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,370
one of those you fix is another person

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:38,950
that can use your site or another group

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:42,190
of people the Keen user sites each fix

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,260
matters and makes a difference if you

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,290
can't get to full compliance right now

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:53,350
that's great as long as you're trying to

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:55,810
move the needle it is obviously best if

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,760
we start from the very beginning

00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,140
thinking about accessibility thinking

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,370
about what our colors are going to do

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,029
when we put them on top of each other

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,679
thinking about how we're going to tap

00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:08,830
our website thinking about with the

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:13,179
screen reader sees so sometimes we don't

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:14,499
have that luxury so I think that that

00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:16,749
answer of when should you start

00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:18,489
accessibility back at the beginning

00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:21,989
before you work there is not really a

00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:31,419
good answer I think the answer is today

00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:33,009
with you so after you started and maybe

00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:34,690
you've been the only one to buy into

00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:41,019
this that's fine maybe you've got some

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:42,309
team members to buy into this start by

00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,320
tackling your reusable components

00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:46,210
because everywhere you fix a reusable

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,700
component you will fix every where it

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,519
loads so some of those issues that are

00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,159
like 22 problems will go down to zero as

00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:59,940
soon as you fix that one div should be a

00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:02,139
button bug or the color contrast is too

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:08,469
similar on the background in the

00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:09,849
foreground on that header and then after

00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:10,809
that it's going to be clean up you're

00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:13,809
going to be dealing with remaining

00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:16,210
issues templates went off pages the

00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:20,889
things that you had to deviate from the

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:23,519
plan for a design issue and after that

00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:27,639
the real work begins

00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:30,059
because these tools only help you reach

00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:34,359
about 30 to 50 percent of compliance

00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:37,869
legal compliance what they don't check

00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:41,649
is whether the words you're using are

00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:47,200
too confusing whether the entire flow of

00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:51,759
the process is too complicated but at

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,539
least you can get these and you can push

00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,539
back on the others

00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:03,779
listen Jenny we did it okay we went

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,840
through we went and handled all the

00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:09,269
accessibility issues it's great all as

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:19,110
well we have an audit we fix those

00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:22,980
things we're done now right great job

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:27,710
that's more than 90% of businesses out

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,710
there I've done and I am so proud of you

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:39,779
but that doesn't change the come you

00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:42,360
know the kind that doesn't change the

00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:46,590
composition of the people that work at

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,799
your company that allows for it to

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,799
happen

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:56,850
but you have to make it a place that

00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:00,750
they feel like working diversity is when

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:10,470
you count the people inclusion is when

00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:14,399
the people count so some question that I

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:16,110
heard and really really liked it first

00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:21,750
was do the people you work with feel

00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:26,340
like they belong and that's a good

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:30,090
question because there are those of us

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:32,309
that are working at our jobs but the

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:37,440
environment isn't exactly conducive to

00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:38,700
being warm and welcoming we don't feel

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,279
like we're part of the team you feel

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:46,169
like we work at the place so this is a

00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:50,880
good question to ask but I want to go

00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:55,100
deeper who is missing from your team

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,100
because they can't belong

00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:05,860
and then I think you should go back and

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:11,320
ask this and then ask this again and

00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:12,700
then ask this ask this again this is a

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,400
cycle this is something that we can do

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:19,390
for ourselves to try the best that we

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,920
can as individuals and those teams to

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:27,610
try to make sure that we aren't the

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:32,110
problem because making it possible it's

00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:35,470
not the same as making it available

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:41,290
making it welcoming making it a place

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:45,880
that people want to be so I have a

00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:48,010
couple examples diversity there is

00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,929
potentially one person of color in this

00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:55,900
photo but because of the gentleman on

00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:57,190
the side who's not on the stage because

00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,890
they didn't think about him when they

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:03,220
decided to have his photo on the stage

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:04,630
they're diverse and I look at this and

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,320
it makes me angry because I feel like

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:11,650
this is the lip-service to diversity

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:15,059
like we have the token woman from India

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:17,350
we have the token guy in a wheelchair

00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:19,059
and we didn't even care enough about the

00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,160
guy in the wheelchair to make sure that

00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,780
when we did a team photo he could

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,290
actually be part of it he has to be off

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,290
to the side

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:38,630
this is inclusion for everyone from

00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:42,560
people missing limbs to people with

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:43,940
canes to people that don't have those

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:49,310
types of physical disabilities are

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:50,990
perfectly capable of being there they

00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,530
all belong they feel like they're meant

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,530
to be there

00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:03,320
you know this is more diverse yes but

00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,940
the teacher is talking to every one of

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,010
the students except with a woman in the

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:12,740
very front row pushed off to the side of

00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:15,520
the a chair his body language almost

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,520
shuts her out

00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,630
and I brought the slide for multiple

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:31,960
reasons the very first time Barbie

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:35,260
decided to do a doll in a wheelchair and

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,960
he was Becky she did not last very long

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:45,279
like 6000 sold in the first buy two days

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:51,279
two weeks but Becky's dream house was

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:53,159
not accessible the wheelchair wouldn't

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:58,000
fit through the doors

00:29:53,159 --> 00:30:04,659
there was only stairwells and the doll

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:09,640
was discontinued relatively quickly they

00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:13,360
brought them back again but the point

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:16,539
here is that inclusion doesn't start

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,799
with well I'm gonna be nice to someone

00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:19,960
in a wheelchair today I'm gonna be nice

00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:25,710
to someone with an invisible disability

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:31,630
with anxiety or with autism or any

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:34,840
number of conditions it starts young it

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:36,610
starts with teaching others as well it

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,720
starts with being the one to stand up

00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:46,419
and say they belong here if you don't

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:51,039
like that then you don't belong here it

00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:54,700
starts with us teaching our children it

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,950
starts with that imaginative play where

00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:03,070
we include people from the very

00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:09,730
beginning did you notice that there's a

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:11,230
woman with a prosthetic leg did you

00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:15,210
notice the shirt that says good vibes

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,210
only that indicates an anxiety disorder

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,000
what other disabilities did you say

00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:44,809
accessibility diversity and inclusion is

00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:46,879
the responsibility of every one of us we

00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:49,749
have the skills the tools and the power

00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:53,119
to make it happen

00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:55,460
we can all be that advocate we can all

00:31:53,119 --> 00:32:01,399
be the one to decide to make one change

00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:07,489
we can all be the one to submit a PR

00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:14,210
that makes an example dev document more

00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:18,769
accessible we can all push for color

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,479
contrast we can all look at things and

00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:23,409
say you know red and green are kind of

00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:25,999
an awful combo how about red and blue

00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:32,479
blue and green are also an awful combo

00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:35,389
how about blue and red how about maybe

00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:36,859
more of a lime green and a magenta if

00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:43,159
we're going to go with that screen and

00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:45,710
red theme what about making sure that we

00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:50,539
have underlines on links because if you

00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:54,440
have enough blindness that things are

00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:56,479
kind of fuzzy or contrast isn't enough

00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:00,799
the links can let you know where to

00:32:56,479 --> 00:33:03,529
click on something or making sure that

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,440
we're using as close to semantic hTML we

00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:08,119
can I know it gets a little crit you

00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,099
know questionable once you start hitting

00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,589
things that aren't semantic HTML like

00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:17,419
tabs or accordions but do the most you

00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:18,830
can and those websites I gave you in the

00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:21,859
beginning will give you hints on how to

00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:27,619
make those even more accessible with

00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:33,200
things like Aria roles we have this

00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:36,039
beautiful opportunity to break open this

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:41,659
industry to a whole new group of people

00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:44,869
smart hardworking people that just want

00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:47,499
a chance just like we did in your first

00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,499
learning code

00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:58,550
are you going to be the person that

00:33:52,790 --> 00:34:02,540
makes that possible or are you going to

00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:06,430
be the person this says it's not really

00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,430
that important to us we sell rainbows

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,010
thank you

00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:28,539
[Applause]
