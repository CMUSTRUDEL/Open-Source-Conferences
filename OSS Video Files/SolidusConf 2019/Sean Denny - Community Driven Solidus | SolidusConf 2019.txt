Publication date: 2019-12-10
Playlist: SolidusConf 2019
Description: 
	Sean gives us a rundown of the Solidus management.

"Community Driven Solidus"
The management of Solidus has largely been nailed down since the dissolution of Stembolt, but what does this new nonprofit, community-driven structure means for the platform long-term? This talk aims to address that questions - and provide an explanation as to why this will benefit the platform.

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:15,269
[Music]

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:18,539
so before I get started in keeping with

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:27,000
the traditions of my people I must take

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:37,550
a selfie I don't know give me your

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:40,649
favorite hand signal keep it pg okay

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,250
feeling kind of cute might give a talk

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:49,320
later

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:50,399
idk and sit alright hello everybody I

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,090
hope you guys are enjoying the

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,129
conference so far I'll make it quick so

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,910
we can get out to the pub night which by

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,520
the way is being hosted by Dan Hoenig

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,199
and Boomer digital it's very important I

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,780
know I said this before to pretty much

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,560
everybody but keep your keep your IDs

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,549
because that's how you'll get the booze

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,220
so before we get started I have to

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,439
introduce myself my name is Sean Denny

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,610
I'm the CIO and lead engineer at tube

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:24,470
Depot my wife and I are effect being oh

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,470
we're expecting our first child in May

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,560
thank you we are excited beyond belief I

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,770
got my start what development earlier in

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,770
life at 11 my dad taught me HTML and I

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,110
built this masterpiece there is an

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:49,350
awards page but I have yet to receive

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:51,659
any so you know in hint I hosted Southie

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,680
solidus last year some of you are in

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,240
this picture and I'm also currently a

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,180
member of solidus management so let's

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,630
get started this talk is about solidus

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,270
management now before I get into that or

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,439
what that means I want to explain why

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,520
it's something that I care about and I

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,430
think that you should care about it too

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,620
so the main reasons that I put this talk

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,170
together or I don't think a lot of the

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,120
community

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,970
and solidus knows how we're manager

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,650
right now so I'd like to go over that a

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,030
little bit maybe demystify the whole

00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,069
thing

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,300
do a quick check up on the platform and

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,540
provide a little bit of feedback for

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,480
going forward I think the way that we've

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,670
decided to manage the project is pretty

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,110
unique and given the importance of

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,400
community and open source and the

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,290
community focused structure that we've

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,220
chosen I'm really excited to see where

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,680
this takes us most of you probably

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,260
already know who's Tim bolt is they were

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,870
a dev agency who managed solidus

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,730
previously they did a lot of work for

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,110
solidus and not not just in the code

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,989
base they really cultivated the

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,630
community that we now enjoy and I think

00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,459
if you ask the solidus developer what

00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,660
their favorite part of working on

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,420
solidus is a lot of them will tell you

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,190
that it is the community so I think our

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,600
job going forward above all else should

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,150
be to ensure that that sense of

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,820
community remains strong and continue to

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,040
build on it I think a lot of people

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,540
underestimate the importance of

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,920
community and open source so I really

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,670
want to stress that point a little bit

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,370
as an open source project you rely on

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,930
your community to make your project work

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,549
you rely on your community to work on

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,040
the project to point out any bugs or

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,690
vulnerabilities to help answer support

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,180
questions in our case you rely on the

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,010
community to fund the project and you

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,989
can hire people to do all of that stuff

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,280
and fund the project elsewhere but then

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,739
you don't really have an open-source

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,540
project anymore the whole idea of open

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,890
source is based around a community

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,980
coming together to work on something

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,690
that they like building a strong

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,930
community should be the first objective

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,340
of any open-source project as really why

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,470
I'm excited about our community focus

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,720
management structure but before I get

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,760
into how that works I want to just

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,900
briefly go over the history of the

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,900
project to get everybody up to speed

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,519
most of you already know all of this so

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,680
I'll be quick in the beginning there was

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,940
spree spree was acquired by first data

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,120
which made a lot of people angry and

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,709
it's been widely regarded as a bad move

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,680
solidus was forked from spree by stimple

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,180
a Canadian consultancy company after a

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,449
few years of smooth sailing steamboat

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,710
was acquired by jewel

00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,419
that lifts solidus without any

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,219
management so a group of concerned

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,930
business owners and community members

00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:35,840
was formed of the solidus stakeholders

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:41,249
to decide what to do

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,779
in the end what we came up with in the

00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:45,960
end what we came up with with the loose

00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:49,560
501c3 style structure with the focus on

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,919
community involvement so here's how it

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,409
works we have meetings every Thursday

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,909
now we used to have meetings every other

00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:59,189
Thursday and then we went into like

00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:01,050
having two meetings a week and that was

00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:03,029
way too much but we had to do it for the

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,279
conference going forward we'll have a

00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,599
meeting every Thursday

00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:10,169
it is an open agenda which means that

00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:11,759
anybody can propose a talking topic if

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:13,770
we have a decision to make we announce

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,449
the votes a week in advance where

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,740
everybody has given a sufficient heads

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:22,349
up they are a simple majority and

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,659
absentee voting is allowed we have a

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:26,879
secretary that's me I organize the

00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:29,310
meetings keep the records and hold the

00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,310
votes we also have a community organizer

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,479
that is W lab and they take a greater

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,969
degree of control and getting things

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,289
done they've really done a lot of work

00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,729
for the platform for example they did

00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,800
all of the the graphic design that you

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,750
see for the conference they did all that

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,949
they do that solace that I oh I mean

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,210
they've already gone over a lot of the

00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,729
stuff that they've done for the platform

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,779
it's it's quite a lot so in exchange for

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,430
all that work they get to be called the

00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:52,289
community organizer they get talked to

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,909
your building on solid-state i/o and of

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:57,120
course the warm fuzzy feelings of

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,830
helping out open source so beyond those

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,930
two appointments nobody has any specific

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,099
responsibilities beyond attending the

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,539
meetings and helping out wherever

00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:08,219
possible this is a list of active

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:11,580
stakeholders I'm not going to read them

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:13,439
but there are 16 in total we also have

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,539
two I would call them inactive

00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:19,080
stakeholders Sean Taylor and Clark

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:21,300
bondsman the founders of stumbled this

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,789
list isn't it's not posted anywhere

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,439
publicly but I'm gonna work on getting

00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:28,069
something like this up soon just because

00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:31,439
we want to be as transparent as possible

00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,990
so to join the group you need to meet

00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,069
one of the following qualifications you

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,050
have to have made three more

00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,969
contributions to solidus by github over

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,950
last year be the author or maintainer of

00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:43,110
a solid extension or be currently can

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,430
through open collective we may expand

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,490
that list going forward but that was

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,230
just sort of a starting point for us we

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,200
really just want you to be active in the

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,610
community if you meet those

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,590
qualifications and you want to join we'd

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,350
love to have you you just have to reach

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,870
out to a current stake holder me Gregor

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,340
really anybody that you know and request

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,380
to vote for your entry if the passes

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:09,110
you're in if it doesn't you can request

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:11,520
any follow-up votes as many as you want

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,720
the minimum expectations of a stake

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,330
holder are to attend the meetings at

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,830
least somewhat regularly and to not act

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,720
in a way that damages the platform we're

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,670
also aware of any any conflict of

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,650
interests that might occur I mean

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,990
obviously if we have anybody from

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,550
support solutions that want to join a

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:35,940
stakeholder channel we might have some

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:42,810
problems with that it would be

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:43,950
interesting I'm sorry oh why not let's

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,790
do it

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,260
so as far as the finances for the

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,510
platform we're using open collective as

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,790
our means for collecting money we don't

00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,740
have an actual entity behind the group

00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,880
which makes that portion of it a little

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,490
bit fuzzy so we like open collective

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,810
because it's just a it's a central

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,310
location where we can keep all of the

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,040
money and we don't have to worry about

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,380
people siphoning it out or doing bad

00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,600
things with it anybody can submit an

00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,990
expense to open collective it has to be

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,900
approved by a member of the the core

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,990
team of open collective not to be

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,130
confused with the core team of solidus

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,390
we really like it because everything is

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,190
transparent you can go there right now

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:31,170
and see what we've been spending money

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:33,030
on so that's how it's structured in a

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:37,380
nutshell we tried to build something

00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:39,300
that's very simple and open and we want

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,030
to make sure that if you have an

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,130
interest in solidus and you want to see

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,950
sellers succeed in the future you can

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,480
you can join in and tell us we've still

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,430
got some work to do but I think we're

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,590
getting there

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,480
so I'm gonna wrap that up I want to

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,130
delve a bit into how solidus is doing

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,850
currently and

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,110
that means for you so there's two things

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,150
I want to point out about solidus over

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,200
the last year the first is that the

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,200
platform has been gaining in popularity

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,390
fairly quickly it's kind of a little

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,750
surprising to me because after the fall

00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:16,070
out of stim ball being acquired and you

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,180
know Hawthorne leaving the platform

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,910
I would really would have expected to

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,140
see a hit and user acquisition but it

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,030
appears that we're just chugging along

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,590
just fine and I think that's sort of a

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:28,580
testament to the community that we've

00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,900
built here the other side of that though

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,480
is that the development on the platform

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,070
has slowed we have lost several paid

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,360
maintain errs and at this point the

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,540
majority of the work on the platform is

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,460
done on a volunteer basis it's not

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,410
necessarily a bad thing that's you know

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,580
kind of what open source is about but it

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,050
does lead me to believe that we need to

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,990
focus on community engagement and

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,000
onboarding a little bit more we've been

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,560
building in users and if we do it right

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,300
that's a resource that we can use to get

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,760
more development work done either with

00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:00,470
more volunteers or by donations that we

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,850
can use to hire maintain errs as far as

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,710
the management goes right now we have a

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,630
good mix of company representation we've

00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,390
got seven people from web development

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:12,020
companies six from end user ecommerce

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,340
companies and one unaffiliated that's 14

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,270
different companies represented within

00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,530
the group I really like that it means

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,730
that we're not in an echo chamber

00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,420
there's a lot of differing opinions

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,070
about what needs to be done and how and

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,900
we're not going to approach the problems

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,270
solely as the people that are

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,590
maintaining solidus some of us like

00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,140
myself are gonna approach them as end

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,510
users of solidus some of us are going to

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,890
approach them as developers who work on

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,720
their clients e-commerce code everyday

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,210
some of us will have to explain all the

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,190
changes that we're making to the

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,390
companies that they service and some of

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,180
us don't even have coding backgrounds

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,850
and the goal is to find a solution to

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,910
these problems that work for everyone or

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,370
at least a majority we'd like to avoid a

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,230
situation where the platform for example

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,640
becomes so skewed so heavily towards end

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,410
users that it becomes a pain to work on

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,330
for developers or the other way around

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,700
we want a platform that works for

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,150
everyone and that only works if everyone

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,150
has a voice

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,629
so while I'm proud of what we've built

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,259
for the management the platform there is

00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,430
obviously still a long way to go we've

00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,740
done a lot of work involving community

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,509
in the management that's great but

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,100
community management managed projects

00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,110
can still be badly managed so we really

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,160
have to be careful going forward to make

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,620
sure that we're doing the right thing

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,050
and we have to avoid mismanaging the

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,920
platform so there's three things that I

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,920
think that we could be doing better

00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:37,399
number one is seeking diversity I

00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,779
mentioned previously that the group has

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,490
a diverse representation of companies

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:43,100
but that's really where the diversity

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,230
ends we do have a lot of different

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,089
backgrounds but currently we have 16

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,910
active stakeholder members and they're

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:52,970
all white men the group is open to

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,199
diversity I mean open source itself is

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,430
built on the idea that anybody can

00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:56,930
contribute regardless of their

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,360
background and I don't think a single

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,649
stakeholder is opposed to the idea but

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,550
the problem is that being open to

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:07,879
diversity isn't enough especially an

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:10,189
open source github poll in 2017 showed

00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,339
that diversity and open source is way

00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:14,720
worse than diversity and tech and

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:18,800
diversity and tech isn't that great to

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,060
begin with I think this is one of the

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,339
most important things that we can work

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,329
on as a community at the moment not just

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,949
because it's the right thing to do I

00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:26,269
mean most of you should be aware of the

00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:28,550
difficulties that minorities face in

00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:32,480
stem but it's also a great way to help

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,649
the platform this is a quote from a four

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,560
Barta khals taking data from the

00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:38,029
McKinsey Global Institute companies in

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,490
the top quartile for gender diversity

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,410
outperform their competitors by 15% and

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,850
those in the top quartile for ethnic

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,699
diversity outperformed their competitors

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,470
by 35% and it's not hard to see why

00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:51,110
people from different backgrounds bring

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,009
different insights and solutions it's

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,290
really as simple as that

00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,689
for solidus to stand out accepting

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,860
diversity isn't enough we need to seek

00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:00,110
it out in the same way that we might

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:04,399
seek out donations to open collect over

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,290
contributions to github number two is

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,059
work with the community as an open

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,740
source project community is our currency

00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:13,339
and we need to continue to do everything

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,809
we can to make community our priority

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,819
we should work on our own wrapping

00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:19,780
process to make it easier for the

00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:21,220
community to contribute I have written

00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,660
we need a roadmap to let the community

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,260
know where we're going what we're

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,630
handling that we should market we should

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,520
market to grow the community we should

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,810
be wary of overly negative or toxic

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,820
sentiments gaining root in the community

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,100
and I say that because nothing kills

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,960
passion faster than excessive negativity

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,790
or prevents a community from growing

00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,750
like toxicity I don't want to work on a

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,580
platform where the community is toxic

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,720
most importantly we should continue to

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,300
work on staying connected with the

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,880
community wherever possible we've done a

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:56,530
good job at this through the

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:59,380
conference's through slack more recently

00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,550
we've sent out a bunch of blog posts we

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,570
can also continue to stay connected

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:08,430
through github Stack Overflow

00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:10,450
newsletters just however we can and

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,070
lastly because everybody working on

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,110
solidus management it's mostly voluntary

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,570
in their free time it can be a little

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,710
hard to get things done it's easy for us

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,750
to make statements and the meetings like

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,820
we need a road map or we should start

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,700
marketing but getting those things done

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,750
requires a lot of time and effort and

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,970
there's very little incentive for anyone

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,040
to actually do them we've been getting

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,650
by ok I mean we brought you this

00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,850
conference with the structure that we

00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,490
have now we've been working on the road

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,910
map thanks a lot in that people have

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,430
this that's great work but just like

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,360
anything else it can always be better

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,850
right now with the exception of myself

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,320
nobody in the group has any specific

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,050
responsibilities besides that of a board

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,990
member I don't know if the way forward

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,170
is to assign responsibilities to people

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,630
or create groups of responsible parties

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,520
or maybe you look at possible incentive

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,720
for getting things things done but it is

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:09,880
something that I like to discuss going

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:12,430
forward so wrapping things up 15 minutes

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,690
all right what we're trying to build is

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,160
a system where everyone in the community

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,220
has a say in the direction of the

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,780
platform we've approached this with a

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,240
community focus and I think as long as

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,610
we keep that focus in mind it'll serve

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,960
us well it's still a work in progress

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,089
and we haven't quite figured everything

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,310
out yet but I'm proud to be a part of it

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,880
and I'm looking forward to making it

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,490
even better for anyone who

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,330
interested in taking part please reach

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,020
out to me or one of the other

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,940
stakeholders we'd love to have you

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,340
anybody in the community who's

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,900
interested in the development of solidus

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,420
we're also we're holding an open meeting

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,550
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. during the hack

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,370
day this will be just like a regular

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,070
stakeholder meetings but everybody's

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,480
invited to attend and propose topics and

00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,630
and just sort of discuss what they'd

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,560
like to see in solidus going forward

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,650
we'd love for you to take part if you're

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,810
going to be around tomorrow speaking of

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:10,020
tomorrow side note I'm leading out a

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:13,050
hike after the hack day we're doing

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,610
donut Falls trail it's an easy

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,920
three-mile hike there's a waterfall at

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:20,520
the end it's one of the most popular in

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,930
Utah so let's go find out why if you're

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,860
interested please join us it'll be a lot

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:28,650
of fun I think we'll be I think we'll be

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,470
meeting up there at 4:30 but keep in

00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:34,140
contact in the comp channel just to keep
