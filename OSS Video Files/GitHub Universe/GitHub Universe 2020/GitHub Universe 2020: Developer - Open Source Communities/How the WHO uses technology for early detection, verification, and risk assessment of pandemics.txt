This panel will focus on the World Health Organization (WHO) and how technology can be used to improve public health. We'll discuss everything from Go.Data, a digital solution for contact tracing, to EIOS, a system that uses publicly available information to support early warning and response to public health threats. We'll also cover role of open source collaboration in WHO's early warning and response initiatives. Audience members will walk away with knowledge about how to engage with major public health organizations—including WHO, the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) community of practice, and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)—to help early detection, verification, and risk assessment of disease outbreaks to prevent pandemics.
