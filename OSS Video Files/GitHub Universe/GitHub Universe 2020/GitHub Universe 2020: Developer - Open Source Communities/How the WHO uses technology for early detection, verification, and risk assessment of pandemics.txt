Description: 
	Presented by 
Mala Kumar, Senior Program Manager, Tech for Social Good, GitHub
Bassem Dghaidi, Solution Architect, GitHub
Sara Hollis, Epidemiologist, World Health Organization
Dušan Milovanović, Lead Architect, World Health Organization

This panel will focus on the World Health Organization (WHO) and how technology can be used to improve public health. We'll discuss everything from Go.Data, a digital solution for contact tracing, to EIOS, a system that uses publicly available information to support early warning and response to public health threats. We'll also cover role of open source collaboration in WHO's early warning and response initiatives. Audience members will walk away with knowledge about how to engage with major public health organizations—including WHO, the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) community of practice, and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)—to help early detection, verification, and risk assessment of disease outbreaks to prevent pandemics.

architect on our professional services

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,399
team

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,320
now bossam and i have been working side

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
by side with who for the past couple of

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,039
months and he was meant to join us today

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
as a panelist

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,160
unfortunately due to circumstances

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,960
beyond his control he's unable to be

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,719
here today

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,080
and so we wish him and his family well

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,559
and we look forward to his return in

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,559
january

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,760
if you're not familiar with tech for

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
social good we're a program at github

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
that essentially ensures that our

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
people our products in our platform are

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,000
helping the social sector build the best

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,680
possible tech solutions

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
for some of the world's most pressing

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
challenges you can learn more about us

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,759
at socialimpact.github.com

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,360
[Music]

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,119
so to kick off the panel today i want to

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,799
talk a bit about an interconnected world

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,400
in public health

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,920
if you're able to join us back in may

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
for a github satellite you might have

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,479
caught the panel that

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
i was able to host with some incredible

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,479
social sector partners on covet 19

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
pandemic responses

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,360
now during the presentation i talked

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,960
about how we had connected with so many

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,320
of our social sector partners to really

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,000
understand how the pandemic was

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,119
affecting them and their communities in

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,520
the early days of the

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,960
of the virus and from those

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,399
conversations we kind of split it out

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,399
into three major categories

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
societal economic and pandemic and while

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,960
that's still really relevant to a lot of

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
the work that the social sector is

00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
currently doing

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
it is important to note that today's

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,950
panel focuses on public health and these

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,840
categories are all closely interrelated

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,200
[Music]

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,800
so if you're not familiar with public

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
health as a discipline essentially it's

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,640
looking at the health and well-being of

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,720
people in societal and community-based

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,560
levels and a seminal person and a

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,599
seminal event in public health was jon

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
snow

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,000
now speaking of england jon snow was an

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,080
english physician in the 1850s and

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
in 1854 there was unfortunately a

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,760
cholera epidemic that broke out and

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,520
killed about 800 people

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,879
at the time it was thought that cholera

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
was transmitted through little particles

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,360
in the air but jon snow had his

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
suspicions otherwise

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,319
and so what he did was he went and

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
tracked each of the individual 800

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
people who died whether it was in a

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
hospital or whether it was in

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,680
a school or a household or a business

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,080
and in some cases even a prison

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
and he plotted all of that on a map and

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
from the work that he did he was pretty

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,959
clearly able to demonstrate that

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
cholera wasn't being transmitted through

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,920
the air but the contamination source was

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,599
actually a well

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
located on broad street in the soho

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,040
neighborhood of london

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,319
and he was able to convince the local

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,760
government that

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,519
because of this they should take away

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,040
the pump from the to the contaminated

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,159
well so that nobody could access that

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
water source

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,080
and almost immediately the cholera cases

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
went down now this is important not just

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,280
because he dispelled

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,879
a really popular myth about cholera

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,400
transmission at the time but he also

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
laid some really foundational work for a

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,640
field called epidemiology which

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,319
is going to tell us more about later is

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
a field that looks at the

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,400
the tracing of diseases like infectious

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
diseases non-infectious diseases and

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,360
other health events like cancer

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,959
in a population now john snow's work is

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,480
seminal to public health and in fact

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,480
it's still cited and used today

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,080
now to state the obvious the world has

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,120
changed a lot since the 1850s and in

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,879
fact if we look at

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,040
data from the united nations department

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,720
of economic and social affairs undeasa

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,080
for short which started reporting data

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,480
in the 1950s

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
we can see for example some indicators

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
that show us how

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,840
how much the world has really changed

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
now one figure is population itself

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,920
so in 1950 when undesta started

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,680
reporting data we were at about 2.5

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,680
billion people worldwide

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
fast forward to today 70 years later and

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
that population is tripled globally

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
we're at about 7.8 million people

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,720
migration is another really interesting

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,239
number back in 1990 there was about 153

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,959
million people we could consider

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,880
asylum seekers or refugees or immigrants

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,160
who went abroad for work or for school

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,639
or for family now today just 30 years

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,960
later

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,320
that number has grown to 271 million so

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,800
that shows us the scale of which we're

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,759
growing as an interconnected world

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,520
now perhaps the most stark comparison is

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,280
coronaviruses themselves right we've all

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
heard this word a lot over the last

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,800
year or so and coronaviruses essentially

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,400
refers to

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,400
a set of viruses that can cause anything

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,160
from a common cold all the way up to

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,840
really severe respiratory diseases like

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,720
covet 19.

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,120
so if we look at some of the

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,800
coronaviruses and in recent memory and

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
the diseases they cause we get a stark

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,440
picture

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,120
for example in 2012 there was a

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,960
coronavirus that originated from the

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,479
middle east and caused the disease we

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,240
now refer to as mers

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
over about an eight year period where

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,639
there is the most active cases

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,160
there are about 2500 cases reported and

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
for my age or older you definitely heard

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
about a disease called sars which came

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,639
from a coronavirus in asia in 2003.

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
that caused about 8 400 cases in an

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,840
eight-month period

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,039
and for sure there's a lot of nuances

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
with the numbers you see here on the

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,199
screen

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,800
in terms of the way that cases are

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
counted so the methodologies that are

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
used

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,720
the period over which you count them and

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,680
then of course the actual viruses

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
transmission

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,160
and the diseases themselves but even if

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
we take all of those nuances into an

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,000
account

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,600
and we we multiply the number of mers

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,880
and sars cases by 10

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
or by 100 or by even 1 000 we are still

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,680
not approaching the scale we see with

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,360
coped 19.

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,199
as of when this deck was finalized we're

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,199
at 63 plus million

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,199
cases and because we're in an active

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,320
period of covet 19 that number is

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,840
definitely going to rise

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
in the coming weeks and coming months

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
so all of this is to say that covid19

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,520
really reinforced the idea that the

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,120
world is just too big

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,039
it's too complicated and it's too

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
interconnected for any one country or

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,080
organization to address public health on

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
its own

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,639
now we're seeing really amazing

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,560
collaboration in traditional public

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,680
health especially with covet 19 vaccine

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,520
development

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,120
and through our research and previous uh

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,039
presentations here at

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,160
github universe and satellite we've had

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,759
the privilege of highlighting some

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,039
incredible organizations that are really

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,400
at the cutting edge

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,400
of technology public health

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,840
collaboration but even though that's

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,120
been around for more than a decade we

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,720
know that there's more that we can do to

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,479
strengthen those solutions to further

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,840
democratize those solutions and really

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,039
to move to more evidence-based

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,400
approaches

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,639
now we know open source is a really

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,639
critical part of that journey and

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,400
to that in github is really proud to be

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,420
an implementation tool for public health

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,400
technology open source collaboration

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,160
[Music]

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,360
well before i pass it on to the sean i

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,680
do want to point out that the world

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,280
health

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,360
organization lives on github at

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,520
github.com backslash world health

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
organization so take note of this link

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,080
because we will be referencing

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
repositories here

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
throughout the presentation over to you

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,479
the channel to talk about public health

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,919
intelligence

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,360
i need to say again thank you for a

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,840
great introduction actually making it

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,759
easier

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,199
now to jump into straight what we're

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,880
doing um

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,080
again good morning afternoon evening

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,919
everyone um

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,479
early detection events and their timely

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,160
verification assessment of risks

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,960
to provide actionable information for

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,680
rapid and effective response to public

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,260
health threats

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,080
is the key to

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,400
[Music]

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
to mitigate and to even neutralize if

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,000
possible

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,000
um impact to society's economies most

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
importantly to save lives

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,039
and uh it's become obvious to everyone i

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
guess

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,479
because the situation we're in with

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
government

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,240
this is the scope of public health

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,919
intelligence discipline that

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,520
i'm engaged with with my team in wga

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:58,080
so what kind next what kind of events

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,680
are we looking for well um early

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,879
detection verification risk assessment

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,199
as i said is one of

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
the strategic priorities of world health

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,400
organization

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,080
uh current global situation we found

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,759
ourselves in with kobe 19

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,400
has made it all the more visible and

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,759
urgent and in response to ever-changing

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
landscapes

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,759
including the way people communicate

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,280
relate interact

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,879
public health intelligence discipline

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,759
adopted all hazards

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,479
one health approach so what does that

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,360
mean

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,720
for example uh massive organization uh

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
caused um

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,000
that people connect with animals in

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,399
nature much

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,039
more than ever before maybe you didn't

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,399
know but

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,880
70 of known uh infectious diseases

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,399
are considered as zoonotic meaning that

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,680
pathogens

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,720
move from animals to people therefore um

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,279
we do not just detect and monitor

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,880
uh for events that relate directly to

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,640
human health we also

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,640
detect events related to animal and

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,120
environmental health

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,959
um on the other hand um we monitor not

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
only disease occurrences in humans but

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,440
also

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,480
hazards that have potential to cause

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
health problems

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,760
such as natural disasters manmade

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,200
disasters conflicts

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,720
mass gatherings next um

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,600
let me tell you then about more what

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
we're doing our starting point is data

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,560
obviously and

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
coming from all kinds of sources and

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,200
there is no shortage of that

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,720
as we all know in public health we talk

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
about different kinds of powerful

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
surveillance

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
information will come from different

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,959
sources such as healthcare facilities

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,519
missions laboratories pharmacies news

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,959
communities field workers hotlines some

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,399
sources are publicly available

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,080
some are not so epidemic intelligence

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,399
from open sources

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,160
is who led global initiatives the

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,519
community of practice

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,200
monitors publicly available information

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
mainly from news channels but other

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
public

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,680
sources and this goal is called public

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,399
health intelligence from open source

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,320
so i guess you may ask but why why do

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,320
you monitor

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,480
what you're trying to detect what is

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,200
happening and

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,800
events of input to help from all this

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
enormous amount

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,440
mostly relevant information from all

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,160
these publicly available sources like

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,079
news social networks etc

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,079
why don't we use information directly

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,959
from the source from the health care

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,160
about the patients when they are

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,680
diagnosed

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,560
for precise given conditions

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,560
well data is actually not readily

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,800
available from the source

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,240
and when date is made available from

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,640
through official channels

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,200
it's delayed to an extent that the delay

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,720
itself can be published

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,880
so that's for early detection

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,480
verification risk assessment

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,720
that's why we are looking at

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,320
different type of sources publicly

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,120
available sources of news

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,399
trying to detect events as early as

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,200
possible

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,560
before i tell you what how does it look

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,079
like really

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,839
let me tell you something about the

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,160
history so

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,160
next

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,480
everything started when the web goes

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,920
down

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,000
soon after 1994 promed started providing

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,880
emails to their subscribers with latest

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360
news related to public health going

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,240
forward

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,519
to 2009 a global health security

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,519
initiative

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,640
was a major milestone to organizing

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,720
towards uh

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,560
connecting content of these different

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,839
public health intelligence systems

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,399
that were developed prior to that

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
in 2013 joint research center european

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,200
commission

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,959
the same team who developed europe media

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,160
monitor that you can see on the screen

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,200
in 2002

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,639
uh helped who to set up

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
hazard's detection risk assessment

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,000
system and that system

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,240
uh evolved in 2017 into

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,560
the system we have today its name is

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,320
epidemic intelligence for open sources

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,880
and that system uses not only

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,839
information from publicly available

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,120
sources the world wide web and social

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,440
media

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,880
but also information from these other

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,880
public health intelligence systems so

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,959
basically in a way it brings together

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,320
uh all information we have access to for

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,040
the purpose of detection

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
verification risk assessment in order to

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,519
inform and provide actual

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,839
intelligence for time response

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,560
so next this is how your system looks

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,600
like

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,240
from the user's perspective on the left

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
hand side

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
is a navigation panel and there you can

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,560
see

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
a global surge of news corresponding in

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,040
time with

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,959
uh kovite 19 detection and confirmation

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,120
um in china at the end of 2019 beginning

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,560
of 2020.

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,760
article panel on the right hand side

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,760
contains a list of news that's

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,839
mathematically categorized as

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,760
in in near real time within a natural

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,560
language processing pipeline of eos

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,839
system

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,320
as containing content about hazards that

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,480
that have potential for public health

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,279
threats

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
since call it 19 outbreak approximately

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,200
100 000 of these

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,600
those kind of news are processed and

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:22,240
stored in your system each day

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,880
before we had influx of 5 15 000

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,079
news of that kind each day so you can

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,320
see the research

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,279
and and the amount of information we are

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,079
dealing with since calling 19

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,760
eos searches for content within 30 000

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,440
news feeds and

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,040
in twelve thousand twelve thousand web

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,839
sources eighty languages

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,519
meant for 240 twitter accounts and

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,199
currently we have more than 40 million

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
use items

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,680
next um

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,480
this is a sneak peek of how user sees

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,519
eos system so navigation panel left side

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,760
actually provides

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,880
text mining features for narrowing the

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,600
search for events

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,279
that have been reported in use an

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,800
article pan on the right side is made up

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,360
of news filtered according to this

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,120
criteria selected on the left side

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,839
and in this example a user is selecting

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,639
respiratory symptoms looking for

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,000
pneumonia

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,880
and unknown disease and you can see that

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,519
on a weekly basis from mid december 2019

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,480
to mid january 2020

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,279
the amount of noise is increased is six

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
volts

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,880
and also you can see on the right side

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,320
of the map that these news are mostly

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,440
placed around this region of china

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,720
next well next

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,800
let me tell you well why we are here and

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
what will tell you more at the end

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,320
and why open source but let me start

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,320
with tell you that whose main

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
main objective actually is to help

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,680
countries worldwide

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,279
as you know to connect collaborate and

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
share information and knowledge

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,760
to improve health and well-being so

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,760
that's that's the solar role of who

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,360
the key word customization objective

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,199
will be strengthened

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,959
by developing information infrastructure

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,360
for connecting information knowledge in

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,600
a global networking information

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,320
so you know i told you how we detect

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,199
today event potential threats is always

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,600
is possible and i told you that we don't

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,160
have

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,639
a possibility to connect directly source

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,639
to to get patient health related data

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,800
from health care systems and their

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,639
individual durations made

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,240
obviously if we would have had this kind

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,079
of access and capabilities

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,920
then we will have even earlier detection

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,040
of more relevant date

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,600
uh this issue is complex and uh it's

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,360
important

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,199
definitely complex and multivariate

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,279
definitely uh we don't have time in this

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,680
panel to talk about this

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,000
um but what can we do in the meantime

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
well in the meantime one way is to

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,519
we'll continue improving our detection

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,199
from public health from publicly

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,759
available sources

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,560
and we can mine volume and information

00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,959
using different

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,959
analytical methods we can

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,800
need a deck of information

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,320
available publicly however we we have

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,320
challenges we

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,519
all this massive information includes

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,600
conspiracy theories

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,120
myths and disinformation we have

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,199
combination of opinions

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,480
and facts so how do we verify this

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,639
information

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,360
so we don't talk to me it's well um

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,920
alongside of analytics that we're using

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
today

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,279
natural language processing trying to

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,480
discover content and context

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,120
in uh this public related information uh

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,519
we planned to

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,120
go with linking data information

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,240
knowledge available in different systems

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
worldwide

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,759
such as those uh which provide public

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,759
health intelligence and those which

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,320
provide contextual information

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,320
and then we can if we have this network

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,959
information uh semantically linked

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,560
together

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,720
we can discover patterns in disease

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,079
progression spread discover similarities

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,680
unrivaled anomalies

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,079
while compiling to local data protection

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,640
rules and regulations

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,559
and this is exactly a strategic

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,160
objective of who going forward with

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,360
public health intelligence

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,039
so next um how do we plan to achieve

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,919
this objective of fostering connection

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,760
and sharing data

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,120
information knowledge not only between

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,319
countries and people as we're doing

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,919
today but

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,919
between different information systems

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,319
and data sets too

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,480
well um we're working internally to

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,600
establish a strategic which initiative

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,799
to develop support of evolution of this

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,760
information network interventions

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,080
and this information network will power

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,919
and be powered by the connected

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,520
artificial augmented energy systems to

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
support not only detection risk

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
assessment

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,520
but also to discover patterns of

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,000
diseases and to learn to forecast in

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,240
what breaks maybe one day in future

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
so by the end of this presentation we'll

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
tell you more about the type of open

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,480
source

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,520
projects that we have and give you more

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,200
ideas about

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,559
why these projects are seen as open

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,960
source but before that i will um

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,520
let you sarah tell you how the team uses

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,640
technology to support fair workers in

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,880
context tracing so with that sarah over

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,880
to you

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,799
i'm to briefly walk you all through the

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,640
go data implementation journey so far

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,320
and how in the context of the code event

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,559
in pandemic especially

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,919
the rapid scale up of this tool now over

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,919
60 plus countries

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,080
has really hinged on the collaboration

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,200
of our user base through platforms like

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,960
github

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,880
and as duchonne highlighted as you'll

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,600
see on the who github page once you

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,360
visit

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,039
this is just one of the many tools

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,880
engaging the open source community in

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,760
regards to pandemic preparedness and

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,360
response

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,039
and hopefully it can provide you just a

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,960
tangible snapshot into how these

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,520
activities are starting to take place

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,799
within the organization so let's travel

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,000
back in time for a moment to the

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,559
pre-covet era

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,480
in particular in 2016 when the goal for

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,080
this project really originated

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,679
there was a request from member state

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,320
countries to who

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,080
to develop a free lightweight tool for

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,600
field level outbreak investigation and

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,520
contact tracing

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,640
this then began the iterative journey of

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,039
requirements gathering

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
and consolidating experiences from who

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,840
and partner institutions

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,840
that have participated in outbreak

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,520
response over the years

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,880
the resulting platform in its more or

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,039
less mature form

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,720
was first piloted in 2019 during the

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,400
ebola outbreak in north korea

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
it came here to an excellent piece that

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,679
i really like it's created through esri

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,600
story maps platform

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,039
and it gives a nice overview of who's

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,160
surveillance activities during this

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,679
response

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,520
just to hone in and focus on the

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,280
cornerstone of this and any outbreak

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,320
response next slide

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,320
testing and contact tracing so once the

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,160
confirmed case is identified the contact

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,200
tracing process begins and community

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,440
level teams

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,440
need to be quickly mobilized in the case

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
here ring vaccination of the newly

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,120
approved vaccine was being introduced

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,120
which involves identifying and tracing

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,280
not only first level contacts but also

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,520
secondary and tertiary level contacts

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,640
so you can begin to imagine the value in

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,960
having a really

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,799
well functioning well-structured tool

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
for data collection that enables you to

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,440
monitor

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,280
hundreds if not thousands of contacts

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,320
across the various aldusantes at any

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,320
given time

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,840
and how vital this could be actually in

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,720
informing practical field-level

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,120
activities on a day-to-day basis

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,480
forward to 2020 when suddenly overnight

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,919
contact tracing is not just something

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,120
you hear about in a presentation of

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,720
ebola response

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,400
but i think that every country country

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,440
of all resource levels and across all

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,360
geographies

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,640
are talking about and frankly it was

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,840
something that many countries

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,360
needed to implement overnight given the

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,200
digital area we live in as well

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,720
contact tracing apps became all the buzz

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,480
as countries were seeking

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
innovative solutions to quickly face

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,240
this crisis i want to spend just a few

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,919
moments to clarify what i mean by

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,039
content tracing app for the purposes of

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,640
this presentation

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,080
the term can be used pretty loosely in

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
the media and many of you in the

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
audience's developers

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,520
may very well be working on projects

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,760
that fall into one of these categories

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,000
so who guidance on digital tools for

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,360
contact tracing published back in june

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,200
lumped these tools into three main

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,520
categories outbreak response

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
proximity tracking and symptom tracking

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,000
the go data tool falls into the first

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,679
category

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,520
and serves really as a reference

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,320
outbreak response tool either for

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
countries

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,679
to use out of the box if they don't

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,600
already have one or for countries to

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,640
align their existing outbreak response

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,960
to a width

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,720
thereby ensuring who standards on

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,039
minimum data collection due to privacy

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,880
etc

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,640
so in the interest of time i'll really

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,320
lie through a few features worth noting

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,159
more information demos are available

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,159
online but here's the initial

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,840
web app interface and there are granular

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,039
user roles and permissions

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,559
that allow different types of

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
surveillance staff to log in and

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,600
interact with

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,200
or access different types of data when

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,880
they go to perform their necessary

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,760
surveillance studies

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,760
to outline quickly a few user personas a

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,760
field epidemiologist may be performing

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,360
case investigations through the web app

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,880
and listing contacts which are then

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,840
automatically assigned to the relevant

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
contact tracer

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,159
to perform follow-ups through their

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,000
mobile and meantime lab personnel might

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,799
be entering in lab results in a separate

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,320
module

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,559
thereby prompting and alerting the

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,400
surveillance team to then

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,240
know which suspect cases are positive

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,240
and which they need to perform a full-on

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,000
case investigation for

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,760
a supervisor at the national level can

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,360
view an aggregate snapshot of the epi

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,919
scenario as you see in the screenshot

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,679
here

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,000
or regional teams can dig deeper into

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,520
the regional uh kpis

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
the platform is built really on

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,799
structured integrated line lists so

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,000
there's an example screenshot here it's

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,159
really giving a centralized

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,159
home to related case and contact data

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,799
that can often be siloed across various

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,320
systems

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,760
including lab and hospitalization data

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,440
next slide perhaps one of the most

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,000
important features is the ability to

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,600
construct

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,280
and visualize chains of transmission

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,080
across the different entities in the

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,600
platform

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,320
through space and time so whether they

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,080
be cases contacts or exposure events

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,440
we also have geospatial mapping

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,919
functionality so

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,559
you can see these linkages overlaid onto

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,080
a base map of your choice

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,440
the platform also illustrates the

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,039
journey of cases and contacts

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,320
longitudinally so a few examples

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,880
screenshots here

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,840
contact follow-up dashboards the ability

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,360
to see

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,120
visually the sequence of events

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,440
occurring for a given case

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,400
or next screenshot honing in on key time

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,400
intervals from a

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,159
performance management perspective so

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
we're seeing here the time lapse between

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,400
symptom onset and specimen collection

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,679
so really the point here is for the data

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,360
to be transformed

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,120
as much as possible into field level

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,080
decision making and any operational

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,919
improvements

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,039
uh at any time that we can

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,720
so um now across the past 11 months from

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,480
our vantage point at who we've been

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,280
supporting governments and institutions

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,120
globally

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,640
to enhance their covenanting context

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,000
tracing activities

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,480
through tools like godada and other

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,240
activities and this slide shows just a

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,000
few examples of where i work with

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,320
country teams on these activities

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,360
starting with drc last december italy

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,039
and early march

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,400
uh europe's largest refugee camp in

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,480
lesbos in november

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,000
and cantonbo in switzerland right here

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,000
in my backyard

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,520
so it's clear how vastly different these

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,159
environments are but the teams i've

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,080
encountered

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,080
along the way have remarkably similar

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,520
challenges needless to say

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,279
there's a lot of power in sharing these

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,039
learnings across settings and really not

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,559
reinventing the wheel

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,919
in this way community building around

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,039
these activities has been an absolute

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,480
necessity

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,240
we all know by now i think that the

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
tried and true boots on the ground

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,320
principles contact tracing don't change

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,039
all that much despite which digital tool

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,880
is used and

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,799
we've put a lot of effort in trying to

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
convene a space for different users to

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,840
interact

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,520
whether it be through who consultations

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,559
where countries present their strategies

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,400
and challenges

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,400
through our online community practice or

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,159
through our github repository

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,080
next slide i think there's a screenshot

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,919
of our community of practice

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,919
and then yeah the next slide we have our

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,400
our github repository there which feel

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,559
free to

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,640
take a screenshot of that so this is uh

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,640
this repo uh it's a central place where

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,559
various users have begun to

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,400
document and share technical resources

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,279
developed and used in the context

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,960
of their go data implementation so

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,960
individual users and institutions we

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
invite them to build on this library

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
of resources and really adapt what they

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,559
can for their specific setting and then

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,799
share it back with the community

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,480
so a few examples of what this entails

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,120
this can include various scripts and

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,520
code snippets in r and python to produce

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,120
automated analyses dashboards directly

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,880
from the platform api

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,520
they have connectors to power bi and

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,520
other external analytics platforms

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,159
we also have browser plugins for

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,559
anonymization of data middleware layers

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,400
kickstart interoperability efforts since

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,440
we know it's it's important that secure

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
data exchange

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,039
is needed in countries where more than

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,440
one system might be taking place for

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,640
routine surveillance and contact tracing

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,240
and we've really had the pleasure of

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
working with a number of universities

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,440
and organizations to begin to build out

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,440
these resources

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,039
so at that we invite you to visit the

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,960
the go data project within the github

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,360
repo to see how you can take part

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
um i think that's it on my end i will

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,120
turn it back to you mala thanks for your

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,480
attention

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,760
great thanks so much sarah and duchamp

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,440
for sharing some really interesting

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,880
insights into your work

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,559
now as we've mentioned quite a few times

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,240
in this presentation open source is a

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,919
really key part of the future of

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
public health technology solutions and

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,320
to that aim the world health

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,840
organization has been working really

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,360
hard the past couple of months to open

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
source not just the work that sarah just

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
mentioned

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,200
but also some applications that

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
deshawn's going to talk about in just a

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
few minutes

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,520
now there's obviously so many

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,120
organizations communities people

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,279
individuals and companies that can plug

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,000
into who work being such a critical

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,400
portion to the public health ecosystem

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,080
but

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
for the next couple of months these

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,320
these are some of the categories of

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,600
organizations that are really critical

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,120
now of course the journey to effective

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,400
open source doesn't happen overnight

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,919
there's a lot of stages that have to

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,200
happen in parallel and so

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,120
uh just really quickly sarah i would

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,200
love to hear about your experience here

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,760
where who is and how it's positively

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,159
impacted

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,159
your work

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,200
sure you know um i think that obviously

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,919
i can speak for the whole organization

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,799
but dushan

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,520
and i as he alluded to earlier and how i

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,840
can certainly

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,600
speak from my experience that we're both

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,640
part of teams among several other teams

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
at who that are

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,640
very much early adopters of this type of

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,360
collaboration within the organization so

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,799
this inner source kind of movement

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,480
that's been really cool to see there's

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,880
been an increasing momentum

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,279
around this so far and not just across

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,120
teams and departments and working

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,880
across in ways that typically they might

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,960
have been siloed but even through levels

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,120
of the organization so country office

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,399
regional office and headquarters

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,000
not not just with the emergencies

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,200
program and the coveted response but i

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,320
used to work on a

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,039
a team at who the who integrated data

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,799
platform

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,279
which really streams inner source it's

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,360
integrated multi-disciplinary team

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,960
doing a shared data platform shared

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,120
reference data and standards

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,640
across i think seven departments so with

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,559
that kind of stuff going on it's really

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,760
really a cause for optimism and it's

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,760
really a cool thing to see

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,720
great thanks so much and then duchenne

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,320
i'm going to ask you the question that

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,679
every it's on everybody's mind

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,679
how can the community get involved

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,559
i think you're in me

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,399
excellent i'm struggling with technology

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,159
um

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,159
yeah so so inner source is one

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,840
one really really important and theories

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,399
and why we decided to

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,880
to have a platform such as github for

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,279
for fostering collaboration within who

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,240
but we have as i mentioned i mean

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,720
during during my my discussion that uh

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
um

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,960
um understanding what's there uh in the

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,960
world and what kind of information

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,640
exists and bringing context together to

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,799
understand really what is happening and

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,200
to react based on facts

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,880
and requires really as yuma mentioned

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
collaboration between different players

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,799
and different people and we can

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,080
realize that going forward

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,760
connecting the world and connect

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,279
information data from different sources

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,159
we need those who have a grassroots

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,000
approach

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,840
so uh one thing is eminence-based

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,360
organizations comes together

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,880
bringing things together but on the

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,799
other hand if you want to react early we

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,840
also need to engage people

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,080
and the more active we all are

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,600
the better chance we have so we have um

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,039
you can engage with us

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,080
we're working actively within who to

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,960
uh to set up governance as we speak for

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,360
open source

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,360
collaboration before we set up

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,640
everything we still open the repository

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,080
that would serve as open source

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,440
communication channel you can see this

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,039

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,080
um uh collaboration guidelines and we

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,720
can use

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,520
issues of discussion to to engage early
