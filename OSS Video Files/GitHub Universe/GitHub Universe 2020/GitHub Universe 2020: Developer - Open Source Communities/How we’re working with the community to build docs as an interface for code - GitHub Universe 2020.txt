Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Developer - Open Source Communities
Description: 
	Presented by Kath Korevec, Senior Director, Product, GitHub

Just like code, docs shouldn't be static. They need to evolve and respond to the changes in the developer world every day. That's why we believe that GitHub Docs are better when they're used in the open—with the people who are building the features and those who are using them all participating in tandem. In this talk, you'll hear about why and how we took our docs public, and the lessons we learned along the way.
