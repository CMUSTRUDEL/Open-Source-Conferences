Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Developer - Open Source Communities
Description: 
	Presented by Neha Batra, Director, Software Engineering, GitHub

Calling all open source maintainers! Your communities have thrived with issues and pull requests. But sometimes you’ve had to get creative with how to engage with each other beyond code. With this session, we’ll explore GitHub Discussions and how the tool can enable you to connect with contributors on new ideas, help others without inflating your issue count, and recognize non-code contributions. We’ll give you an insider’s look at the beta, share learnings from maintainers at Vercel, Gatsby, Node,js, and others who have been testing out GitHub Discussions, and showcase the possibilities of what you can do to energize your community. We’ll even slip in a sneak peek for what’s to come!
