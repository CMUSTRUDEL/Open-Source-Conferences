Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Developer - Open Source Communities
Description: 
	Presented by 
Erik Duveblad, Principal Member of Technical Staff, Oracle
Robin Westberg, Consulting Member of Technical Staff, Oracle

Erik and Robin are the two developers who wrote over 50,000 lines of Java to enable the transition of OpenJDK—which is relied upon by millions of developers around the world—to Git and GitHub. This session will cover the challenges they discovered over the two-year migration, as they transitioned an established open source community from using a self-hosted Mercurial server to using Git and GitHub. You'll learn how Erik and Robin converted over 65,000 Mercurial commits to Git, created GitHub apps to customize contribution workflow, and how they scaled pull requests to work well for an open source project with over 250 active contributors.
