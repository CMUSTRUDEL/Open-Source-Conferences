Publication date: 2020-12-12
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Play - Inspiring Tech
Description: 
	Presented by 
Abhinay Khoparzi, Musician, Live Coder; Co-founder/Instigator, Algorave India
Samarth Gulati, Product Designer / UX Engineer, Independent

Live coding artist Abhinay Khoparzi will join forces with Samarth Gulati to deliver a livecoded AV performance with custom performance software built on TidalCycles and Hydra respectively. Khoparzi plays with time signatures, microsound, and synthesis to produce broken beats and simulate projectile IDM that may sound like a post apocalyptic party organized by robots after they have taken over humanity.

Please note this performance includes high intensity flashes and may be within certain frequency ranges which may not be suitable for all audiences, specially those who have photosensitivity.
