[Music]

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,639
hi

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,400
welcome to this talk about webex r and y

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,640
means for the future of the web

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,640
my name is jama sanchez i work as a ux

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,000
ui engineer doing visualization at

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,519
deepmind

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,119
i've been coding on the web for many

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,760
years using webgl

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,560
webvr and now webxr both professionally

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,199
and as a hobby

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,800
doing creative coding i'd like to thank

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,640
github universe for the opportunity to

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,320
talk about webxr

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,040
its state and its exciting future

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
so what is webxr simply put is a

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,399
javascript api to use

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,120
xr devices cool but what does that mean

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,520
it's a way for web pages to access an xr

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
device's inputs and outputs

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
xr is the term that covers vr virtual

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,800
reality ar

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,719
reality mr mixed reality with the x

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
being the thing the unknown

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,920
the variable in the equation it's also

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,240
usually referred as extended

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,400
hardware that enables xr applications is

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,320
now probably available to consumers

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
offering an immersive computing platform

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
with new opportunities and challenges

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,840
webxr allows any web developer to

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,040
explore these opportunities

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,040
and challenges from the web

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,439
so as many talks about the future there

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,000
has to be a recap of history to

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,159
understand how

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
we got here and how it shapes the way it

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,880
progresses

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
but i'll be very quick because

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,119
everything that led us here

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,040
can be forgotten and started new

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,040
basically it started with adding browser

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,280
support to the oculus dk1

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,200
which was a rotational controllerless

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
hmd which means it wouldn't track your

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,640
position

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,119
or half ways to interact that experiment

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,040
became

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,040
really interesting and powerful and a

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
great stepping stone for bringing vr to

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,720
the web

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
as new headsets came the cardboard gear

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,920
vr

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,560
vive go it became obvious that yvr

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,719
wasn't

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,840
well conditioned to evolve with quickly

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,439
changing hardware

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,560
with new patterns and developers

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,600
expectations so webvr 1.1 shipped in

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,879
some browsers

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,680
got deprecated and removed in some

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,599
engines

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
it was time to do something better with

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,879
the lessons learned

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,200
this new thing is webex it's a new api

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,959
that

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,959
fully replaces a webvr came to me

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,160
after listening to developer think of

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,480
the confusing or

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,520
efficient parts the pain points while

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,519
developing

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
iterating on emerging best practices and

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
patterns

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,599
so it's now more flexible and future

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,440
proof it maps better 2x our hardware

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
the new patterns to users and developers

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,080
expectations like

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,080
low latency and high refresh rate

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
it provides improved support for input

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,879
and output now

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,440
know more about the devices which

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,680
greatly simplifies rendering to them

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,560
enables a unified input model with

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
standardized

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,840
layouts for buttons triggers touchpads

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,519
and for instance we can now get 3d

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,480
models of the controllers from a content

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,400
delivery network

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
no need to host them or keep up with

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,560
them it also brings a better

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,360
understanding of the user space

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,440
to know if we are dealing with cardboard

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,959
that can only rotate or vive that can

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,920
move around inside the boundaries of a

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,400
guardian

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,480
or an air experience that can move

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
freely all over the world

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,599
he also provides performance

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,640
improvements mostly supported by the

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,879
back-ends

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,360
like faster and better rendering or

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,599
video decoding

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,799
and enables a shared code path for

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,840
multiple outputs

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,760
the code for inline magic window ar vr

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
app doesn't require much branching now

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,080
which greatly

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,720
simplifies development

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,239
websites are under the immersive working

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,239
group which is a w3c

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,280
group this is important because it means

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,799
there is a roadmap

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,200
so the implementation won't be changing

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,879
under your feet webview was a bit more

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,280
loose on its approach of

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,720
trying things and see if they worked and

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
were adopted

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,239
website is an independently designed

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
standard with lots of similarities to

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
open xr

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,560
because they try to tackle the same

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,159
problems and similar landscape

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,080
so there's a mutually beneficial

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,280
feedback loop between both apis

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,799
but it's not like opengl and the api is

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,799
different but most back-end

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,079
implementations follow the open xr

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,320
spell being a working group with a spec

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,120
means that new features can be supported

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,800
fairly quickly

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,960
because there's no need to figure out

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
anything or reverse engineer

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,160
it improves on the early adopter nature

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
of webvr

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,919
and it's backed by industry we have

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,320
google mozilla

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,759
oculus microsoft unity and many others

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,199
behind

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,880
all the activity of this group happens

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,199
in github so you can go and check it and

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,639
contribute

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,479
so what is webxr for users

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,479
it means that you can enjoy vr and ar

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
content the same way you consume any

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,600
other content

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,600
can you imagine a web without embedded

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
video players there was a time when that

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,759
was also experimental

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
so practically speaking it means that a

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,160
web page can

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,240
offer the option to go into vr or ar

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,720
track controllers if they are required

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,479
with the security of the browser sandbox

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,160
no download and installation of apps

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,240
with even permissions

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
just hop on virtual environments without

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
leaving the browser

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
pages can go from flat to surrounding

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,440
worlds in an instant

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,600
experiences can go from amazing 360

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,240
video which are still massively popular

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
with cardboard users to furniture

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,800
browsing chemistry analysis

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,120
games anything you can imagine so for

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
instance mozilla apps is a vr chat room

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,960
and open source project that explores

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,800
how communication in mixed reality can

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,680
come to life and lots of interesting and

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,120
weird things

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,120
are happening in this virtual space

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,880
for developers it means being able to

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,960
develop xr sites and apps

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,080
with the same workflow as any other web

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
development

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,600
the libraries and frameworks you're

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,440
familiar with the same simple and

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,639
affordable cross-platform development

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
environment

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,919
you will need webgl javascript and some

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,919
dom to begin with

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,800
but all the web tech can be used

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,360
webassembly webrtc for instance in the

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,600
image

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,280
makepad uses rust to create a

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,240
collaborative shader editor

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,880
which you can also check on github your

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,560
app can

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,039
benefit from instant delivery and

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
updates with a huge reach of the web

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,160
with improved security because it

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,400
requires https

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,120
no apps to download or install no store

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,600
so what does webxr provide so through

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,319
the api the page can connect to an xr

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,039
device

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
which could be something like a dream

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,720
headset

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,720
or nokus go

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,840
if the users are austis and then they

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
just capabilities

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,759
with an xr session started on that

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,520
device it can keep querying the pose

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,680
and send images to the device output

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,039
if the experiences requires controllers

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,560
and they're only available

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,520
for instance like this clicker or the

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,639
oculus controller it also provides

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,240
access to the posts

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,840
and inputs like trigger buttons

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,680
touchpads or controllers

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,360
and even access to the actuators which

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,360
can provide haptic feedback

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,080
so in practice this is achieved via

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,599
multiple modular parts

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,400
parts are actually currently available

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,240
to everyone are the webxr device api

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
is the one that actually provides access

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
to inputs and outputs capabilities of an

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,199
xr

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,880
device the content rendered to the

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,160
devices is provided

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,599
via webgl the gamepad's module allows

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
interacting with the buttons

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,639
triggers thumbsticks and touchpads of an

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
xxr

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,440
input device the ar module works the

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,360
same as the immersive vr content by

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,479
guarantees that the user's environment

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,479
will be visible

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,759
and aligned with the rendered content

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,520
this may be achieved

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
with see-through displays like the

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,440
horror lens or the magiclip

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680
or video pass-through systems like air

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,280
core or art which is basically your

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,639
phone

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,720
the heat test module provides

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,479
information about the real world and a

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,479
method for developers to heat test

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,400
against it becomes very important for

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,960
really immersive ar applications

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,520
so things can be grounded on the world

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,639
the dom

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,199
overlays api provides a way to show dom

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,680
content

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,360
such as text and input elements for an

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
immersive arc session

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
this content is displayed as a

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
transparent background layer

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,479
super imposed on the real world scene

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
and the rendered webgl content

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,800
it's very useful to quickly build

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,160
interactive air apps

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
there are more modules in different

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,400
stages of design implementation and

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,919
support

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,279
and i'll talk a bit more about them

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,360
later so what can we build

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,440
it's about supporting the immersive web

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,800
web in a responsive way

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,399
vr ar inline irregular page all cases

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,240
can be supported

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,399
you can still apply the principle of

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,440
progressive enhancement to xr

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,279
so building the immersive web can mean

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,480
experiencing virtual walls through the

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,480
browser

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
virtual content seamlessly integrated in

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,279
your browsing experience

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
limitless possibilities with web

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,519
platform it's really all about the

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,440
future

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,600
so how does one get to build the

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
immersive web you can of course just use

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
webgl

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,640
and javascript and grind through and but

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,399
fortunately there are several javascript

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
frameworks that support many web xr

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,279
features

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,200
and have a very active community of

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,760
developers and adopters

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,440
in alphabetical order there's a-frame a

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,000
web framework for building 3d

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,800
ar and vr experiences declaratively with

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,279
html and an entity component system

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
babylon js with loads of tools and a

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,640
great ide

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,040
play canvas is another great webgl

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,680
engine with ide and webextra support

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,120
and 3gs very widely used has plenty of

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,959
documentation and examples

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,959
it also has a very active community to

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,440
bridge with other frameworks like 3d

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,000
react

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,680
or spell 3. the four of them are on

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,519
github you can check their progress

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,040
and contribute any time if not a web dev

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,040
there are still options to build content

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,120
for the web and use the power of webxr

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,279
like some options are facebook photos

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
and videos with react 360

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,680
which allows to create exciting 360 and

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,440
their experiences using react

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,279
google model viewer is a custom element

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,240
that you can use to easily display

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,680
interactive 3d models on the web also on

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,920
github

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,240
sketchfab is a platform to publish share

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,480
discover buy and sell 3d vr and ar

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,040
content has an amazing team behind it

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,880
and they are developing great tech

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,560
sumerian is a new platform for

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,720
developers to build and host

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,640
vr ar and 3d apps quickly and with

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,320
minimal coding

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,560
in unity one of the most well-known

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
cross-platform game engines

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,160
uh there's an explorer by mozilla

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,120
reality and other exporters are being

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,200
developed

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,600
and finally verge 3d is a toolkit for

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,839
blender 3ds max or maya to create

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,839
immersive web-based experiences

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,760
but if you go the way of building

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,079
yourself uh you have to

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,760
choose a framework and depending on your

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,839
framework of choice you get support for

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,920
different key features for xr

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,680
this is a general thing with vr it's not

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,040
related directly to xr

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,720
but when looking at a framework or

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,440
engine it's important to look for things

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,640
like

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,279
locomotion we've learned a lot since

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,040
headsets first allowed us to move higher

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,000
refresh rates have helped with motion

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
sickness and lots

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
of testing arrangers have helped improve

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,079
our patterns for moving around

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,519
but we still need to choose or implement

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,600
a locomotion mechanic for our

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,839
experiences

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,959
in the same vein physics lie at the core

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,200
of many immersive

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,480
experiences because we can believe

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
non-realistic things

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,920
behaving in a physical correct way

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,120
better than realistic

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,680
looking things behaving unrealistically

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,120
related to that animation with things

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
like bone animation

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,160
skinny rigging or are very useful to

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,560
make things more lifelike

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,000
and heat testing the ability to touch

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,839
and interact with the world

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,360
in vr is relatively straightforward

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,360
since the scene is all under

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,320
experience control because it's created

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,079
by it with ar or mr is slightly more

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,920
complicated because information

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
from the real world needs to be fed and

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,480
processed there's something related

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
coming up

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
more on that later some more things to

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,079
consider

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,519
hand tracking for instance this has been

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,600
a recent development in

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
local's quest and there's a module for

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,680
that behind the flag

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,440
to be able to use hands with no hardware

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,880
the system recognizes hands and fingers

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,160
and they can be used to interact with

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,839
the scene

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
once enabled you get the joints of the

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,880
different parts of the hand but the

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,760
actual rendering of the hand is left to

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,680
the experience

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,519
so you need something that can load the

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,079
appropriate model and do some bone

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,160
animation to distort it

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,680
also related input models as mentioned

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,959
there's a repository of controller

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,040
models that can be used

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,320
via a content delivery network so you

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,240
can draw them accurately

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,040
instead of drawing a generic controller

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,040
or a box improving the immersion

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,720
and finally things like text rendering

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,160
would be ideal to have something like

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,000
css and dom

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,279
the layers module that is also coming

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,279
soon will help with this

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,200
but any way you want to render text you

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,440
will need some support for

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,399
fonts layout crease rendering

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,120
so talking about support basically for

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,959
vr

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,680
you have android with cardboard daydream

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,279
through chrome you've got some samsung

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,880
phones with the android samsung internet

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,000
browser

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,079
um and android firefox with the polyfill

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,160
polyfill is a javascript implementation

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,800
of the webxr device api

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
as well as the webxr gamepad module it

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,279
allows

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
developers to write against the latest

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,200
specification providing support when

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,560
random browsers that implement the webvr

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,720
1.1 spec

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,199
or a mobile devices with no webvr or

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,680
webxr support that's all

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,959
for ios you can use the mozilla webxr

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,720
viewer which is

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,639
basically a webxr content renderer it's

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,600
not a full flex browser

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,279
or safari with the polyfill in

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
standalone headsets idioclus you can use

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,800
the across browser or firefox reality

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,279
which is a browser from mozilla that is

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
designed

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
for browsing the open web in virtual

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,040
reality

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,399
and for windows you can use chrome and

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,880
edge there's

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,120
not many vr options right now for mac os

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,240
or linux

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,839
regarding ar or mr

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,760
the android phones with aircore and

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,800
chrome or samsung phones with samsung

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,959
internet browser

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,959
and for this standalone with a magiclip

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
with the heliorx socket or

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,279
file functionality and the hololens tool

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,480
with the mixed reality toolkit and

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,959
firefox reality

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,920
and again there's not many options of ar

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,160
for windows

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,000
mac os or linux so if you want to get

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,040
started right now the best way

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,040
it's probably an oculus quest 2 with the

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,279
oculus browser for vr

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,560
and an android phone with ar core and

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,279
chrome for ayat

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,160
so what's this being used for what is

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,760
being built

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
many things are being built right now

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,760
there's just a few examples

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,920
lots of games and entertainment some

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,120
examples on the bottom left there's moon

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,440
rider an open source game

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,000
similar to beat saver created by super

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,399
medium the maintainers of a-frame

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
a troll tower by daniel esteban

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,519
construct arcade has a whole set of

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,279
cabinets to play user created xr games

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,959
there's also space for artistic

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,480
experiences that combine images

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,040
procedural generation

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,880
video streaming web audio there's a very

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,800
active creative coding scene

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,639
on the top left we have an example by

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,240
within who have been building immersive

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,000
experiences for years

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,120
what you don't know is an experience on

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,839
the creative process of mafia gear

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560
also advertising and campaigns for

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,199
brands

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,440
on the bottom right lucian has an ar ad

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,680
for a fictional sneakers campaign

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
and of course education virtual visits

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,399
to museums where you can interact with

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,160
everything

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,560
interactive collaborative lessons with

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,800
explorable diagrams and explanations

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
on the top right frame that lets you

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,720
easily meet and create

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,639
with others in private 3d spaces is now

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,440
focusing on virtual classrooms

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,199
more options for commerce you can see

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
objects close up before buying them

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,600
without visiting the store

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,880
you can see customized versions of any

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,720
thing you want to purchase

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,800
place it in the wall place furniture in

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,040
your house and see if the colors match

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,120
play canvas has examples for ar

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,680
furniture shopify supports the model

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,680
viewer

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,600
sketchfab is widely used more cases

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,519
indicates real estate companies and

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,079
house hunters can use and benefit from

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,279
virtual

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,680
tours to houses for productivity

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,600
all the collaboration measurements

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,680
finding directions great presentations

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,680
all kinds of useful tools

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,360
there's nifty reality a virtual reality

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
space on the web that lets you run

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,519
multiple 3d applications

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,519
at the same time or solder by google

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
that uses webxr to help visualize

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,600
distance

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
social distancing guidelines in your

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,880
environment

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,279
and of course research with

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,040
things like protein and molecule viewers

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,399
multi-dimensional data exploration

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,320
visualizations ai agents training

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,160
for examples at visualization in

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,000
deepmind we use webxr

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,000
to be able to review agents in their

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,720
training environments with metrics and

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,959
analytics

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,959
and even interact with them in ar and vr

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,400
but it's also about building the

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,640
metaverse

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,559
the web enables connectivity and sharing

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,400
and so you can think as

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,319
a potential explosion of content like

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,120
geo cities and flash

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,160
we have examples like tracosis 360

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,600
volumetric video by

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
xr social and x3 engine lots of things

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,720
happening

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,720
in hubs fabian beneteau shows live

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,520
coding in a virtual room with multiple

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280
viewers

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,799
as his streams while coding a light

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,400
switch in a vr environment

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,559
affecting a real world internet of

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,120
things light bulb all happening vr

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,720
and over the internet we've also seen

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,400
multiple actors performing

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,559
live from different cities in future

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,640
stages of mozilla hubs

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,840
or we've seen valencia james dancing

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,400
over live stream

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,400
volumetric video into hubs

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,080
so things are coming soon new features

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,760
that are here but behind the flag which

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
means they will be soon available for

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,679
everyone

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,360
an input model module exposes the poses

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,120
of hand skeleton joints

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,960
it can be used to render a hand model in

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,400
vr scenarios as well as perform gesture

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,840
detection with the hands

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,039
does not provide access to a full hand

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,880
mesh that's where the framework is

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,039
becoming boring as we said earlier

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,720
in the top image you can see how 3.js

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,520
supports hand tracking and rendering out

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,280
of the box

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,960
and on the bottom image sign language

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,720
detection by handy js by steve smith

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,480
also there is sbi that brings

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,679
composition layers which are useful for

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,840
displaying information

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,000
text video or textures that are intended

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,400
to be focal objects in your scene

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,080
improv's performance and battery life

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
with enhanced visual fidelity

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,679
you can render images stereo cue maps as

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,200
backdrops and more

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,039
on the right you can see a preview of

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,480
how super medium a comic book in

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,799
magazine either 4xr

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,840
uses layers to greatly improve fidelity

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,840
and performance

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,400
in progress also are some really nice

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,919
features depth sensing exposes

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,240
information about the distance from the

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,919
user's device to the real world geometry

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,600
in the user's environment

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,679
you can see it in the first image by

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,080
maxim's natives for play canvas the

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,360
digital rabbits are partly occluded by

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,280
the physical table

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,880
this is huge for immersive ar since it

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,559
gives better heat testing and object

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
occlusion

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,160
also image tracking recognizes user

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,919
specified images

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,320
in the environment and provides tracking

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,000
information in the center image also by

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,480
maxims you can see a cube

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,039
and a digital book cover that are

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,919
attached

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,360
and tracked with a real book cover a

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,160
lighting estimation that provides

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,760
information

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,360
for the renderer to improve shading

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,360
shadows reflections

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,480
so content appears more natural and

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,320
integrated

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,000
brandon john shows us how the extra

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
dinosaurs are integrated better in their

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,760
environments

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,000
using that new information and also more

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,679
things

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
like access to the camera on top of the

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,280
er sdk

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,039
it will provide extra power to the user

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,960
by applying computer vision or

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,600
artificial intelligence to the feed

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,960
like detecting hands or faces which that

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,000
do not necessarily fall under the

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,799
responsibilities of the ar layer

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,320
and finally dom to vr similar to the

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,880
dome overlay for ar

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,159
vrc bellows developers have long wanted

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
to be able to

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,200
use regular web content in their vr

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,880
environments

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,799
it's very important because it will make

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
much easier and seamless the integration

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,640
of content

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,559
with xr and many more new features that

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,159
are coming soon not directly related to

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,280
web server but like

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,000
in improving the ecosystem like web gpu

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,400
which is designed

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,039
from the ground up to efficiently map to

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,799
modern native gpu apis

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,159
web gpu is not related to what gl and

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,760
it's meant to be its successor

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,320
in the future it will be used to provide

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,039
the rendered content to actual devices

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,720
progressive web apps pws for short are

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,559
web applications that have been designed

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
so they are capable reliable and

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,520
installable

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,960
these three pillars transform them into

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,120
an experience that feels

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
like a platform specific application

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,640
bring this to vr and you'll be able to

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,480
start web apps from within the shell

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
like if they were native

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,480
and more adoption in the future there's

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,120
a bunch of new hmds for both vr and ar

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
coming up

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,520
new users new accessories new features

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,280
in the image you can see a promotional

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,960
image of facebook's infinite office

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,039
a set of tools to improve the virtual

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,799
office experience you can see how it's a

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,640
browser and visual studio code which is

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,320
built with web check

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,919
and maybe the feature will see more

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,520
browser engines implementing webxr

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,840
so talking about the future what does

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,679
the future hold we know many brilliant

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,159
interesting things are being built but

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,039
what could it look like for any web user

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,120
some of these ideas are are just ideas

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,880
some are being actively researched and

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,880
or even or some are even developed as

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
products as we speak

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,440
maybe there can be a web of such simple

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,159
and tangible things as 3d objects

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,799
which can be seen in vr or placed in ar

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,039
with some hot areas or script buttons

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,880
which link to other similar objects

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,000
sketchfab and facebook photos have

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,400
already showed us that

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,679
it's a viable format we may see a return

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,280
of web rings where

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,600
people place their content online and

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,600
link it in a gibson-esque way

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,120
an object can be a small cube but it can

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,039
also be a whole room

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,960
all share that interconnected via the

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,799
web

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,799
another interesting thought can the web

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,679
core technology html

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,679
grow to embrace xr we saw html5 bring

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,320
the standardization of many new tags

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,240
which have

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,760
enabled amazing experience that nowadays

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,880
we take for granted

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,799
same with css3 can we look forward to a

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,760
full valid markup supported by the

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,640
browser to build

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,320
extra experiences and at the same time

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,400
we need a way to consume

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,080
content that is not ready for vr or that

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,320
doesn't need the third dimension in

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,640
general but it could benefit from it

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,520
wikipedia is a to the scrolling

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,440
experience

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
by illustrations and graphs can be 3d

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,360
and interactive like read along an

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,840
article as objects and projections

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,840
to spy

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,880
we could find a way to build even

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,840
smaller components than pwas

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,240
or turn pws into widgets that we can

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,720
place

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,039
around in our virtual space nodes

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,880
calendars videos social feeds

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,799
we could consume a vast array of data

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,080
with small adapters for all our web

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,559
content

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,679
could be the return of microservices

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,120
could be the return of

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,720
active channels or yahoo pipes aardvark

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,240
for instance is an augmented reality

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,520
layer that incorporates multiple

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,039
applications or gadgets

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,200
on top of existing vr worlds

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,400
and finally stepping out of the page

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,679
back into the browser

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,000
can a browser be an xr experience itself

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,760
can it transcend the 2d projected window

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,400
and be a shell on its own

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,480
how would that work right now we know in

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,440
vr our whole view our whole world has

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,600
been replaced

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,960
rendered by the experience and we have

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,200
to go back to the shell

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,400
to be sure we're safe that's why there's

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
no link traversal yet

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
a malicious site could try to imitate

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,840
your shell and try to fish some

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,000
confidential data

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,000
we've developed all these ui notions

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,679
like the patch log for secure connection

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,279
that live in the browser chrome in the

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,120
area outside of the page

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,200
whether they leave when in vr when the

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,080
page the chrome the browser are not

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,159
there

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,279
is there physical manifestation in the

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,520
vr world

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,320
is the companion hovering near you that

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,360
you can talk to

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,559
like an assistant will xr be

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,960
interacted with mostly via voice

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,039
some gestures could bring a safe bubble

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,440
inside any vr experience where you know

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,679
nothing can render on top of the browser

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,960
like a meditation gesture to move all

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,400
the virtual content away

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,400
and get out of the matrix

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,960
so of course all this opens new

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,159
questions for which we have very few

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,799
solid answers

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,400
how do we deal with accessibility not

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,279
only text readability and contrast

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,320
factors but

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,760
how can screen reader even work on vr or

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,679
er

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,600
can we afford to make experiences that

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,000
discourage visually impaired users

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,360
or make a control or locomotion schema

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,799
that can't be used by physically

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,240
impaired users

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,000
or something as simple as making

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,960
experiences that don't account for

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,039
left-handed users or children

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,400
as we mentioned before with the risk of

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,039
traversing their content

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,799
how do we tackle security what patterns

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,200
can we develop that make it

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,840
secure and safe can we let kids go

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,000
happily browsing with an hmd

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,200
more so how do we bring forward the

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,120
extensible web

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,279
make sure that any developer can easily

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,080
use all these components and extend them

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,400
instead of using black boxes these are

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,400
all

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,600
questions that need many people to work

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,840
on them

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,120
the great thing of the web and webxr is

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,559
that many of these problems can be

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,799
explored quite easily

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,520
and the explorations get huge rich with

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,159
little complication

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,360
so that's it go explore right now if

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,400
you're interested

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,720
head to immersive web github

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,679
and check it out start building anything

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,279
your mind can

00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:06,000
come up with let's go build a future

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:06,000
