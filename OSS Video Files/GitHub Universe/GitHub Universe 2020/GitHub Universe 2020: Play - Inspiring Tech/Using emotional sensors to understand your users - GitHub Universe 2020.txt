Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Play - Inspiring Tech
Description: 
	Presented by Elliott Bruce Hedman, Head Design Researcher, mPath

In this talk, Dr. Elliott Hedman will use psychophysiological sensors to measure a customer's subconscious and emotional reactions to products. He'll show you how product design improves when you know the exact moments your customers get stressed, excited, and confused.

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,599
hi

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,359
i'm dr elliott hedman using emotional

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
sensors to understand your users

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,880
how many of you have asked this question

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,800
why are customers leaving our product

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,400
or we can flip that around how do we

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,559
make this product better how do we

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,040
innovate this

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,640
my job is i get hired by people to

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,640
specifically answer

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,879
these questions about how do we make

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,320
better products or what's going on

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,760
with our customers leaving now when

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
i work with these companies that ask

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,559
this question a lot of times they have a

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,760
lot of data

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,960
and they're looking at this data and

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
they're trying to figure out what's

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
going wrong

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,960
but most of the time that data is

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
missing a key element because ultimately

00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,359
how we answer that question is not

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,440
through

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,359
just pure data but we need to understand

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,199
customers emotions

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,799
it's the emotions that help tell the

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,040
story about what's going on and what

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,280
needs to be done

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,119
to give you an example of this this is a

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,119
classic problem i find it's a funnel

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,280
challenge is that we have people coming

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,040
in but at this exact step

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,040
so many of them are leaving we can tell

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
you exactly how many and at what time

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
they leave

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,240
but they can't tell you why they're

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,600
leaving and that's particularly the

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,640
question you need to ask is what is

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
happening here

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,159
how do we change this how do we get more

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,079
people engaged

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,840
that's an emotional question because you

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,520
know maybe the answer is

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,280
well you asked them to make a choice and

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,000
they didn't know what to do here so they

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,399
quit

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,920
or maybe the answer is you know they

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,960
just came in because they wanted to play

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
with your product

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,000
but you never gave them a chance to play

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,840
or maybe

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
you've really confused them they don't

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,479
understand what's going on and they're

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320
quitting at this point in time

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,520
all of those stories can explain this

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,280
data

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,439
but our data is really bad at telling

00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
that part of it the emotional part of

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,799
what

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,880
customers want that being said

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
there are ways you can measure customers

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,360
emotions and that's what i

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,200
focus on extracting the human emotional

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
element from date alone is hard

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,760
if not impossible if all you're looking

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,480
at is web traffic

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,920
you're not going to get the full story

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
but there are some really cool ways of

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,400
measuring emotions and that's why i was

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,760
invited to this talk

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
and that's what i want to talk about

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,599
here is the sensor that i helped create

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,599
at the mit mini lab for my phd this is a

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,760
skin conductance sensor

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,040
it measures how open your skin

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,400
conductance is

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,920
now why would that be important well so

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
and i know i have a technical audience

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
so i'm going to get a little more

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
technical than usual here

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
what we're doing is we're putting

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
electricity here and it goes all the way

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
through and then it gets out to the

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,080
other side

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
and what we're measuring is the

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,280
conductance it's kind of the inverse of

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
resistance so

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,400
the more you start sweating the easier

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,120
it is

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
for the electricity to go through so why

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,239
do i care about sweat and we're talking

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,440
about micro levels of sweat you wouldn't

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,159
actually be able to see it

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,840
but why sweat is important is because

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,720
it's tied to your sympathetic nervous

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
system

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,400
your sympathetic nervous system is your

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,560
fight-or-flight response

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,680
when your eyes dilate your heart starts

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,920
pumping

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
your skin conductions also increases

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,360
that's when your

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,920
sympathetic nervous system is activating

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,080
it's going up and down all the time

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,000
and so with this sensor we can tell you

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,959
the exact moment someone is getting

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
excited

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
or they're paying a lot of attention and

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,360
what i want to

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,920
show you in the next 20 minutes is that

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,360
if you measure your customers emotions

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,200
the number of insights you're going to

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,959
have into why they're quitting or what

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
you need to do to make a better product

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
it's just gonna

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
blow out of the roof it's just a

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,599
completely different experience

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
once you've started measuring emotions

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
now i'm gonna do that

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,000
is showing you a variety of bizarre case

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,159
studies they probably

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,159
won't directly relate to you but i hope

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,920
they're inspiring and wow

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
there's so much i don't know about

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,680
people and their emotions that if i just

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,080
looked i would find so many other things

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,840
so let's get going with some examples

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,560
the first example i'm going to show

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
is with the new world symphony the new

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,239
world symphony

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,919
holds this amazing classical concerts

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,680
but the problem with classical concerts

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,280
is they're losing about 30

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,720
of their audience every year and new

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,960
people are not coming in

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,120
so my job was to figure out how do we

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,400
make it so that more people come to the

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,479
classical concert

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,919
i want to show you a little bit of data

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,759
from what we got from this

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,759
by data i mean the emotional data

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,520
before i show you the first graph i need

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,120
to explain a little bit about how to

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,479
measure skin conductance

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
you're going to see a ton of these

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,160
graphs we have way too many graphs in

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,600
this presentation but they're really fun

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,919
so as you can see these little white uh

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,639
these little white spikes those are

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,320
moments of skin conductance increasing

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,759
that's when a person is getting excited

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,759
they're getting more engaged

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,880
their their skin conductance is

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,919
increasing their heart's starting to

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,360
beat faster

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,720
and these moments where we don't see

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
those spikes those are moments when

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
they're

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,639
getting calm but probably more likely

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
bored they're struggling to pay

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
attention

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,440
so when you see these spikes these are

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
moments of high engagement

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,639
and when you see these dips those are

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,759
moments when the person's checking out

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,280
so let's look at some spikes here this

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,560
is a expert concert goer he loves going

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,759
to the new world symphony

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
and this is him listening to the

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
firebird you can see of all these spikes

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
he's getting engaged he's loving the

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
music

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
he reported it was a really great

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,440
experience now in the next one

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,479
i need you to pay close attention to

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,199
this one because in the next one i'm

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,400
going to show you a

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,320
similar experience but in this one the

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,840
concertgoer had never gone to a

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,880
classical concert before

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,039
let's look at his skin conductance

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,199
okay just in case you missed it this is

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,680
the person who's never been to a concert

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,600
and this is a person who's gone to a ton

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,919
of concerts before

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,639
we found this type of result all the

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
time that

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,919
a person who's never been to a classroom

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,400
concert they're not reacting to the

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,759
music

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
it's really hard for them to get

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,919
emotionally engaged

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,919
but that doesn't mean that you know no

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
one can react to the music it just means

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,759
that they actually react to very

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,919
different

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,960
things if it's the first time they went

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,280
to the concert

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,560
so let's take a look at another person's

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,240
first time going to the concert but i'm

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
going to zoom out to the entire concert

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,639
so you can see a little bit about what

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,639
does excite them

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,720
so the yellow part here at the beginning

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,120
that's then lifting to a classical

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
concert but then a host comes up

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
and then mc starts talking and every

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,000
time the emcee starts talking

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,680
we see that person re-engaging staying

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
awake staying alert

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,240
when they're being talked to and this

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,440
talk doesn't actually last for very long

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,400
as soon as

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
after a minute the host itself actually

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,599
starts

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,039
becoming boring too but what's happening

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,599
here is a transition

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,240
when we move from one item to another

00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,680
item

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,360
it gets us re-excited it gets us

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,039
re-alerted because there's novel

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
information

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,639
so with this point i actually advise the

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,639
new world symphony that

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,319
you need to make your classical music

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
only about a minute to two minutes long

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,919
because it's really hard to pay

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,360
attention

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,199
and then put different things in between

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,000
them to keep us awake to keep us alert

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720
so that we have new

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
stimuli now on the second part of this

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,360
person's concert

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,120
we can actually see that she does react

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,039
to some music this is the quietest part

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,400
of romeo and juliet and this is the main

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
theme of romeo and juliet

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,160
now i'm not going to sing it for you

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,520
sometimes i try but i'm a little i'm a

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,440
little rusty at this point

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
but you have heard the main theme of

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,120
romeo and juliet again it's

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,720
the classical love scene you hear it all

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,080
the time like in cartoon shows and

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,000
things like that

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,360
when this person heard the concert she

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
recognized that same as well

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,840
she got very excited when she heard that

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
very emotional part that she knew

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,039
it ends up that we have emotional

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,160
reactions to things that we are

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,080
familiar with and when we're familiar we

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,240
can anticipate it and we can

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,319
actually play along with my music so

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,520
with that being said what i recommended

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,680
to the new world symphony there

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
is why don't we start giving them music

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,759
that they're familiar with instead of

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,280
these

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,000
kind of esoteric music that only experts

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,759
would appreciate

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
as much so maybe we should be playing

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,400
more red hot chili peppers instead of

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,400
beethoven

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,479
okay so i'm imagining a lot of you guys

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,280
in the audience do not make classical

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,560
concerts

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,319
so i'm going to share some things that

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,400
might be more relevant to you

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,400
in web design and e-commerce as well

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,479
so this is working with a

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,959
big box company who is working on how to

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,640
better sell ipads and laptops

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,080
this is the emotional experience of

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,279
someone as they're browsing by

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
themselves

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,240
those little spikes right there that's

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,200
them getting excited they're figuring it

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,920
out they're

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,279
engaging with the product and then an

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,440
employee comes in

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,440
and when the employee comes in we see a

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,279
huge dip

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,160
that employee actually ruined the

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,560
shopping experience for the shopper

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,160
that the employee started talking about

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,360
trying to upsell them trying to get them

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,600
to buy a cell phone

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
but they removed the shopper from being

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,360
able to play an experience you're going

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
to hear the word play a lot i find it

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,360
usually describes the best experience

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,640
you could have for your user in whatever

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,279
experience

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,200
so what i did is i showed this to my

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,480
client and we had some conversations

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,399
about

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,839
we need to reshape what a shopping

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,160
experience is and

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,160
an employee is not there to help push a

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
cell and employees there is to open up

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,279
the experience and to create an even

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,880
better playing experience

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,399
but when the employee did this one they

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,399
actually literally took the ipad

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,920
out of the customer's hand to show them

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,080
things and that's not what we want to be

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
doing

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
okay speaking of play this is my

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,320
favorite example of creating play

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
experiences

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,800
i was hired to solve this really fun

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,640
problem of how do we sell

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,320
more vacuum cleaners not the regular

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,519
vacuum cleaners these are the big vacuum

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,959
cleaners that you put

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,399
into the garage i watched a bunch of

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,160
people buying vacuums

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,160
and while a lot of them didn't have the

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
best experiences i noticed that there

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,839
was a constant theme of when they

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,200
started using the vacuum cleaner

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,200
they would get excited so if they're

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
opening the lid if they're turning on

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,320
the vacuum cleaner if they're turning on

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
a weaker vacuum cleaner

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,320
these are moments when the customers

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,680
were getting excited

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,519
and so we sat down and we kind of

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,600
brainstormed well what would it take

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,200
to even make that more fun if people

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
like playing with the vacuums

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,440
how can we make playing a more central

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,839
piece of our experience

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,640
and so we actually created in our

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,200
prototype

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,399
a water fountain you could actually plug

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,440
in the vacuum cleaner to the water

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,959
fountain and it'll suck up

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,480
different amount of water depending on

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,320
how strong it was

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,680
when people were trying out this vacuum

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,440
cleaner prototype they actually said it

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,839
was the best shopping experience they

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,040
ever had in the store

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,320
now we then measured people's emotional

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
experiences as they were trying to help

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,880
the waterfront

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,560
and to no one's surprise that water

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,240
fountain seeing it go up and down was an

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,680
incredibly engaging piece

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,519
to the buying experience

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,040
now this might all sound really fluffy

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,800
so far it's like oh that's cute

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
you know people are having a better

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,920
emotional experience but this has

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,160
real live consequences when we

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,600
implemented this we actually created a

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
water fountain and put it into different

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,880
stores

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,240
now we didn't really check with

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,760
facilities and we weren't allowed to

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
make water fountains so we had a tennis

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,399
ball water fountain instead when we

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,279
tested it

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
but when we tested out this this water

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,360
fountain idea

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
that was showing emotional engagement

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,200
but

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,040
we got nine percent increased sales in

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,959
vacuum cleaners just nine percent more

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,959
just by having people more engaged so

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,519
the emotional reactions people have has

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,440
huge consequences on your product if you

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,240
can design it correctly

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,600
and now for my last one uh example i

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,920
want to show you

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,160
a story that's near and dear to my heart

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,000
so about half of the work i do is with

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,519
adults but the other half i work with

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,880
is kids kids emotional experiences are

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,920
seldomly measured

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,760
and i find it very interesting how much

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,959
kids need a different type of experience

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,079
that we're not delivering so i'm going

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,360
to show an example of that

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,959
first i want to show a video of a kid as

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
she's learning to do double a digit

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,440
edition now there's going to be a lot of

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
things on the screen so i'm going to

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
explain

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,079
she's using the screen over here this

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,000
little red and white dot up here at the

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,839
top that's eye tracking glasses so we

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
can see exactly what she's looking at

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,279
when she gets engaged on the side here

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,639
is her skin conductance

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
you're going to see orange spikes when

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,600
they're getting excited and this is

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,360
where we are right now

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
i will just give you a spoiler right now

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
something's going to happen where she's

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,519
going to get a

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,720
huge spike i want you to try to figure

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,720
out what's going on

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,720
i'm going to unplug my mic and hope this

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,959
works

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,639
uh that's not quite right

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:07,839
look at the picture what is 26

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,839
plus seven

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
okay

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:48,639
that's right 26 plus 7

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:50,800
is 33.

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,760
that spike right there is bigger than

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,720
you'll ever see

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,360
in a person playing video games and a

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,199
person

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,279
buying things and a person uh

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,720
playing with lego sets that spike right

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,680
there is the biggest spike i've ever

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,000
seen in any of my research before

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,240
it all came about when a kindergarten

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,600
girl solved 26 plus seven

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,519
the first time she's ever done double

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,800
digit edition and she got it right

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
and i want to talk a little bit more

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,279
about how

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,880
these this emotional data helped inspire

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,639
us to build new products

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,440
and what the consequences of that were

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,560
oh no i pushed the wrong button

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,839
okay so just to kind of get a zoom out

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,240
hey remember i told you i was going to

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,240
show that graph again here it is

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,760
this is when she's asked what is 26 plus

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,920
7 asking people questions

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,519
consistently creates spikes and then she

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,720
answers it wrong but answering it wrong

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,079
does not disengage you it actually

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,279
re-engages you you're like oh man

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,800
there's something i don't know i got to

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,160
pay more attention

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,240
and then she answers it correct and we

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,120
get the biggest spike we've ever seen

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,279
now i've done about five years of

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,880
research on what it takes to create

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,320
good educational software and i want to

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,079
show a little bit more about what we

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,160
were finding here

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,680
consistently we found when kids were

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,440
reading they were getting

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,199
really bored it didn't matter what the

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,680
book was it's just

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,279
reading really disengages kids in our

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,959
ipad generation

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,560
but while reading was disengaging them

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,320
whenever they got to a question

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
they got excited just like in that graph

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
i showed you before

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,120
we saw this pattern over and over again

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
is that the questions are the central

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
piece

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,079
of educational software for kids but

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,600
that's not how we build educational

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,560
software most of the questions are put

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,920
at the end and

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,440
they're kind of just there to confirm

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,959
the kids did it where the reading's

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,480
supposed to be the central part

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,160
but we flipped that on its head and i

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,079
want to show you what happens

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,360
i work at the boys and girls club you

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,040
know with covert right now i actually

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,079
work there every single day

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,199
as a literary specialist and i work with

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,800
kids to figure out

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,839
what would it take to make it so reading

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,079
is not boring for you that that's my job

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,600
and i want to show you what we did so

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,360
the next graph i'm going to show you we

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,079
took a third grade english language

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,079
learner

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,279
and we had him read the adventures of dr

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,440
too little i'm going to show you the

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,720
graph of what that looks like

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,120
you can see we started out with some

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,839
spikes as i introduced the book

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,360
but at seven minutes in he and dr

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,079
doolittle they're not the best of

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,320
friends i actually

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,560
went into the research booth and there

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,920
was a big pile of drool on the page he

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,639
ended on

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,759
now this is the experience for so many

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,920
third graders

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
out there right now especially you know

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,279
when they're at home and they don't even

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,800
have a community to read with

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,480
now that doesn't mean that now this kid

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,320
he's being told he's lazy that he's

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,480
stupid that he's horrible at reading

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,759
he's getting these messages in him but i

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,440
don't actually think that's the case

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,399
the case is more that he didn't have a

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,480
good emotional stimuli with the reading

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,440
so that same day we gave him this test

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,800
we showed him

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,040
what we've been developing which is

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,360
called wonder stories and in wonder

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,320
stories we had

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,759
the kid be able to answer questions

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,920
right now it's like you can answer

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,759
seven questions in about a five minute

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,480
story so there's constantly critical

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,279
thinking

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,800
and there's constant interactivity it's

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,720
not just a passive story

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,559
and i want you to see what happens when

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,400
you read wonder stories

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,000
that's the same kid but now he has all

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,360
these spikes because he's cognitively

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,160
engaged and he's participating in the

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,000
reading

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,439
and at the end of it he gave me his

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,199
favorite compliment my favorite

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,319
compliment which was

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,199
wow that was almost as fun as math

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,640
but as you can see when we understand

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,760
people's emotional experiences and

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
design for them

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,600
we can do incredibly different things

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,799
but we just have to really look in and

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,799
understand what's going on

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,039
now i kind of had another scene here but

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
i didn't want to spoil it at the

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,160
beginning

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280
which is not only should you measure

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,600
emotions but

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,880
how we present emotions can massively

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,559
change

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,080
uh your attitudes to things i did a test

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,520
with lego where i

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,200
told them that they needed to include

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
parents more with their building

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,880
instructions and

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
i got 18 by when i just told the story

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,160
of a kid who really needed help

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,679
i showed a video of a kid with that skin

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,559
conductance much like i showed a video

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,160
to you guys

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,600
we got 75 buy-in now this is interesting

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
i told the same story

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,720
but in one i showed the data the

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
emotional data and the other i just told

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,480
the story

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,039
it ends up being the case that we don't

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
trust

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,360
emotional stories very much we want that

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,039
data we want the numbers

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,799
but when you just give me an emotion

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,160
without the numbers it's really hard for

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,520
me to believe it because i'll come up

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,960
with my own story

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,799
and that kind of comes into the first

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,679
insight i wanted to share

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,200
without emotional data stakeholders use

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,360
their gut to make decisions

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,039
we kind of decide did i enjoy it did i

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,160
not enjoy it that doesn't work very well

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,200
if you're doing it for kids or you're

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
doing it for a customer

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,000
who might be thinking a little bit

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,360
differently than the ceo

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,840
the second insight i want to share with

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,760
you is you will never design the right

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
emotional experience the first time

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,799
when we built the vacuum cleaners it

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,720
wasn't correct

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,960
i'm still working on wonder stories it

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,160
didn't sometimes it works but sometimes

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
it doesn't we have to keep

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,840
changing things over and over again to

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,480
figure out what emotional experience

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
works

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,280
customers are good at telling us when it

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,280
doesn't work but they're not necessarily

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,720
good at telling us how to fix it and so

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,360
you have to keep iterating to build

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,000
those really good emotional experiences

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,120
number three businesses are obsessed

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,799
with happiness

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,559
you know i'm sure you guys have some

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,760
happiness index about what you want your

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,120
customers feeling

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
but i actually suggest looking at

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,000
different emotions because happiness as

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
you can tell i never

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,960
put that in there you should look at

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
confidence attention understanding and

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,559
play

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,160
number four if a test user does not

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,000
actually need your product you will not

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,000
measure accurate emotions

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,120
most user tests are with people who

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
don't care about your product and

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,840
they're just clicking through

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,919
and surprised they're not having an

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,559
emotional reaction

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
number five measuring emotions add the

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,559
much

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,200
needed human element to your data

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,720
at the end of the day this is what i

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
want you to take away

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,160
you should look into ways of measuring

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,160
the emotions of your customers there's

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,160
many ways of doing it and you're gonna

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
be incredibly excited about how i'll

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,679
help you innovate

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,200
we've ran out of time i'd love to keep

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,520
this conversation going

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,799
i'm not able to connect via this way so

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,840
please email me
