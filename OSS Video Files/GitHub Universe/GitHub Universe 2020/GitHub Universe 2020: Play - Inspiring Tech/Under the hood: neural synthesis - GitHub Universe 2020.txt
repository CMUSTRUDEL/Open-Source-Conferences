[Music]

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
hi

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,039
i'm portra exo and i am here today to

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,080
talk a bit about neurosynthesis

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,000
i am an interdisciplinary artist i

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,560
started with classical piano training

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,359
and my obsession with electronic music

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,599
production

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,960
is what led me to my obsession with

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,160
music here

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,440
music technology and where i am now

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,040
working with ai

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,000
and new media so i'd like to start off

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,760
with talking about two really strong

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,440
emotions that i have found

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,360
myself experiencing and also

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,280
with other musicians when i've talked

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,440
about new technology

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,719
and that is fear and fascination and

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,520
what's really interesting

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
is how sometimes when there is a new

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,640
technological advancement

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,879
we have this fascination and curiosity

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,399
and

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,920
interest in it at the same time

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
sometimes there are

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,360
feelings of fear that this new

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
technology might replace an old

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,960
technology

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,600
and maybe along with it replace or get

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,360
rid of

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,799
old approaches and jobs but we have seen

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,240
throughout history that this isn't

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,360
always the case

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,400
the acoustic piano and synthesizers

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,920
are both used in music production

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,640
and live performance and they've simply

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
proved that there are just two different

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,680
ways of

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
expressing and creating in a similar but

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,759
different way

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,079
and we could say the same about guitars

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,320
acoustic guitars and electric guitars

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,960
are

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,360
similar approaches but one hasn't

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,439
replaced and gotten rid of the other

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,640
they both still exist and so

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,600
i found myself very curious

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
about these similar feelings around a.i

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,119
what

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,119
is ai what does it actually do and

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,799
i think most of us when we think about

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,960
a.i we have

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,759
an image in our heads maybe similar to

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,800
this ai has this possibility and

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,520
and ability to really

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,480
prove as a interesting tool for

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,520
self-reflection

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,280
and it can be the most intimate way for

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,040
humans to understand

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,000
our own selves at least through data

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,200
and i really wanted to explore a little

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,760
bit deeper into

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,280
my own feelings of fear and fascination

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,319
with ai

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,840
and lift the hood and

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,680
what understand what does it mean to

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,280
even work with data in the first place

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,160
and what does it look like

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,720
what is it what could it sound like and

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
um

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,720
what has been really interesting

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,280
throughout my research it was to

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,360
understand the limitations of the

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,239
technology so while i think

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800
it's really interesting and important to

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,360
see how far our human imagination

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,959
can go and the actual possibilities of

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,920
these fear-based

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,440
thoughts and emotions i think it's also

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,840
interesting and important to understand

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,159
the limitations of the technologies

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,120
and i have found a lot of creative

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,760
inspiration

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:19,040
in learning the limitations so

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,480
last year i started my artist residency

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,959
at factory berlin

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,159
which i finished earlier this year and i

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,319
focused on

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,080
computational creativity and human

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,519
machine collaboration

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,560
and so here my project partner cj carr

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,239
and i decided to feed one

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,720
hour of my vocals from previous songs

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:46,239
into his custom neural network

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,280
that then produced 10 hours of new audio

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,680
over two and a half days so cj carr

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,439
is also a musician and a data scientist

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,120
and he specializes in machine learning

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,040
with raw audio

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,159
and so just to give you some samples

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,840
of what this journey sounded like and

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,879
felt like

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,920
here is one audio clip from the first

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,400
day

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,400
and this is one of the earlier audio

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
clips

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,960
so a lot of distortion a lot of noise

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
but creepy sounding

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,240
um almost almost sounds like it goes to

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
the machine and you can tell there's

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,240
like a human voice trying to come out

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:43,840
but not quite um middle of day one we

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:43,840
started to get some more melodic content

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
towards the end of day one we started

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,720
getting a bit more clarity and some

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,199
lyrical content

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,080
by day two we started getting clearer

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:11,600
audio with

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:14,800
longer phrases

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,199
so what's been really interesting about

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,039
this

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:22,080
project was listening to

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,080
10 hours of audio like this

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,440
first of all 5 to ten percent of it was

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
actually usable

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,800
with audio clips like this where there

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,320
were actual lyrical

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,639
and melodic content and while it

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,120
didn't create full long enough phrases

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,720
where you could hear a cohesive melody

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,919
or a lyric

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,520
it it created a new approach

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,960
to songwriting that i i didn't predict

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,120
to come out of this i actually didn't

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,919
know what would end up

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,440
um what would the discoveries be at the

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,199
end of this research project

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,000
um and what ended up happening was this

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,759
this game of fill in the blank because

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,240
ai wasn't smart enough to create these

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,120
full phrases and also sometimes the

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
the audio that came out it sounded like

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,560
words but

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
not always and it was a bit of a

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,520
combination of gibberish

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,880
and and full words and so

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,680
this fun game of fill in the blank is

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,319
an approach that we decide to use for

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,639
eurovision's first ever ai song contest

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,440
that they did earlier this year

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,160
and we helped germany win the jury vote

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,560
which was really exciting and they

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
awarded us based on the most creative

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,720
use of ai

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,759
we decided to use as many custom neural

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
networks

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,240
that databots really wanted to push

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,479
to really find out how far we could go

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,000
with the creative use of ai

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:57,759
and so here is a little sample

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,080
of the song and one approach that we

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,520
took

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,880
was beating his ai mod or databots ai

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
model

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,360
with a bunch of songs from 1950s of

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,880
eurovision songs

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,840
and i decided to co-write in in a duet

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,410
[Music]

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:28,840
fashion

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:31,840
[Applause]

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
oh

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,450
oh

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:55,199
[Music]

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:58,160
[Applause]

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,199
you can hear the entire track on youtube

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,560
and spotify

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,520
it's probably one of the weirdest songs

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,319
i've ever been part of it's got like

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,680
death metal in it and some weird strange

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,919
pop edm

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
um and we got some really interesting

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,039
reactions

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:19,120
and new dialogue and new narratives

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,919
and the eurovision jury team

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,000
were invited to write about the contest

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,160
which was featured in google's

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,199
magenta team's blog which you can read

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,680
more about um

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,199
to find out some deeper insights of some

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
of our approaches

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,080
um and then a few months ago

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,560
i really wanted to dive a little deeper

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
into

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,479
creating a much more tangible like a

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,440
physical experience

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,200
of of this data and so i collaborated

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,279
with another interdisciplinary artist

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,560
named sibelica volleybastos

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,399
and um instagram instagram

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,399
spark ar platform um recently

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,160
at around that same time released this

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,040
ability to

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,920
introduce audio into instagram filters

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,959
in a new way

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,600
so we decided to create this filter

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
where

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,920
we showcase three of the ai audio

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,000
samples and you can

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,040
glitch the visuals and the audio at the

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
same time

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,320
you're more than welcome to visit my

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,680
instagram page where

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,279
you can try it out and

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,320
i will close this presentation with um

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,839
my one github contribution

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,320
which is a nice one i like to um

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,200
i like to talk about because it it also

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
ties into

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,160
how my obsession with creating physical

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,360
experience all started

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,720
and i hope to contribute more

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,959
exciting projects to github this was a

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,920
hackathon that i participated in back in

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,680
2018 at usc called creating reality

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,360
and we won the grand prize um

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,240
and uh winner of ar and vr for

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,360
good category and for the project we

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,800
decided to

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,360
give people an experience using hololens

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,360
translating colors and sounds the way i

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,959
experience colors and sounds so you

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,680
could like tap different

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,560
colors with your fingers and that was a

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
really

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,600
fun experience to have because i'm not a

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,360
coder

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,920
i'm not a developer but i'm very much

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,120
inspired by code and

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,480
it time and time again technology has

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,240
constantly proved to be so inspiring

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,839
because they've helped

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,600
to create these new ways to express and

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,279
communicate

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,600
the way i experience senses

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:49,040
and my very very last thought

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,760
around about technology and ai is

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,720
i hope that tools we could will become

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
more accessible

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
and ai will become more democratized for

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
creatives to work with them

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,320
and i hope to see more creative work

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
because

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
i do think that it's really important

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,880
especially

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,920
especially now with ai that we

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,320
open ourselves up a bit more and and

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,160
stay curious and remember that

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,440
technology is simply here

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,480
to be different methods and different

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,360
tools

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,240
to help create and and sometimes not

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,079
even just for

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
creativity but even in a much more

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,640
practical sense

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
and somehow in the context of ai we've

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
somehow

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,839
lost a little bit of this narrative that

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,680
ai can serve as very interesting and

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,519
inspiring

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,959
ways and methods to creating

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,240
so this is how you can reach me on

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,079

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,360
