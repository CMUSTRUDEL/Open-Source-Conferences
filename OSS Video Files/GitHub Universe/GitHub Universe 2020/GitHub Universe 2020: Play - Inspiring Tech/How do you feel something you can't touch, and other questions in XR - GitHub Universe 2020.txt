Title: How do you feel something you can't touch, and other questions in XR - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-12
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Play - Inspiring Tech
Description: 
	Presented by Eliza Struthers-Jobin, artist & programmer, Independent

While imagining the hidden spaces that exist in the overlap between the physical and the digital, Eliza discovered a place neither quite here or there where she has set up shop. Using devices and digital intelligence as her tools, she explores our sense of play, and challenges our sense of presence and perception to bring us back to ourselves.

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
all right so

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,640
hi welcome to my talk i'm eliza i'm an

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,920
artist

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,119
and a programmer as well as a

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,840
researcher and an educator and uh

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,080
some of my past lives include a brief

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,480
but illuminating stint in advertising

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,679
as well as a fascinating period i spent

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,680
working

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,360
as a journalist i was there on the cusp

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,840
of social media so

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,360
it was definitely interesting to witness

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,680
the shift in how things were done

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,000
in a newsroom and i worked for quite a

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,360
while

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,360
in video two i wore many hats uh in that

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,079
industry uh content creation but

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
definitely i enjoyed editing the most

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,600
and

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,719
i mentioned these past lives because

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
there's an interesting

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
common thread that kind of weaves itself

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,960
through there

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,680
and that's that each of these industries

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,520
and the positions that i occupied

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
kind of rely on people's emotional

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,880
response

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,479
people's senses being triggered in some

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
way and while i'm

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,960
not so into the commoditization of that

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,320
um i have always been pretty interested

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,200
in these topics

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,640
of emotional response and why and how

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
people feel and all that

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
um and you know my time working as a

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
brand

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,119
strategist and as a journalist certainly

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
allowed space for me to explore that as

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,040
did the time i spent

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,880
editing videos each of these areas kind

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,399
of represents their own

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,799
opportunity to observe and inquire about

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,399
what makes people respond but it wasn't

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,759
until i really

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,880
got my hands dirty with code and cg

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,680
computer graphics

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,000
in particular that i was able to find

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,040
the ideal conduit for me to explore

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,880
sensory response emotional triggers

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,520
in a way that felt right and integral

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,840
for me my work is very focused

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,200
on experimentation and that's as true

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
for me

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,720
as it is for others like i wanna

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
experiment um

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,120
make cool things learn new things and

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,200
hopefully anyone who encounters my work

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
you know gets drawn in feels that pull

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,160
to play around and work out what's in

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,319
front of them

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
and how they feel called to interact

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,640
with it

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,520
so that's kind of the overarching theme

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,080
for me

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
um as someone who is a self-taught

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
programmer

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,400
for the most part um definitely when it

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,280
comes to

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,560
you know cg i've learned to really

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
appreciate

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,959
the science of math and you know all the

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,080
funky things that we can do

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,760
um thanks to numbers uh and any past

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
math teacher of mine would probably spit

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,400
their coffee out hearing me say that but

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
um

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
yeah and i can go in so many different

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
directions with this but in particular

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
right now

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
what i'm talking about is shaders um

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,640
which are definitely

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,560
up there for me when it comes to things

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,360
i'm excited about and kind of forever

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,159
obsessed with

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
shaders make things look pretty or i

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,400
should say

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
shaders make things look however you

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
want them to look um

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,959
and that's important because in my case

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,400
i want people to

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,640
want to touch the 3d creations that make

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
that i make and so i use shaders to

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,319
support that but that's a lot of math

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,760
and you know on the topic of math it's

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,080
just so crazy to me

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
to think that um i can use like the

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,200
rhythm of a sine wave to create

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,959
patterns on a screen so yeah and

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,200
uh just a quick shout out because she's

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,680
in the gift with me uh to aletheia

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,760
the lovely lovely friend of mine with

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,280
whom i often code shaders

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,799
um yeah we get together and kind of

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
record snippets of ourselves coding

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
shaders

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,239
and it's a lot of fun so yeah i'm

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
equally a big fan of collaboration and

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,720
pair programming

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,920
um some other things that i enjoy using

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,959
code for

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,519
include sound i use this tool called

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,400
orca

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
which was created by hundred rabbits and

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
i love it because

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,599
there's just very sparse kind of

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,599
documentation

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,879
it kind of forces you to just play

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,799
around and explore

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,640
which are two guiding principles in my

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,280
work i guess it's probably become

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
pretty clear at this point um but yeah

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
because

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,120
we're not here for rules at least i'm

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,400
not and not all play

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,160
needs rules right and again um here

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,680
the same math that kind of governs

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,919
shader coding also

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
governs the frequencies that i use you

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,520
know in my sound exploration

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,360
so it all comes back to the sine wave

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
which just you know it's the overlap

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,120
that

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,040
um common language to express something

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,360
that's so vastly different like colorful

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,759
pixels dancing around on a screen and an

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,720
actual sound that you hear reverberating

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,720
in your head uh yeah but you know these

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,320
are just some of the interests i think

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,560
um of mine that complement and support

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,000
the larger core of what i do

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
which is using real time and mostly 3d

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,520
graphics to explore

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,800
interactivity and sensory response in

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,960
the overlap

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,720
between the digital and the physical

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,160
world so

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,520
let's talk about the overlap for a

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,080
second i spend a lot of time

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,120
playing around with merging the digital

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,199
with the real

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,160
i'm really interested in kind of

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,400
hijacking or

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
i guess repurposing the tools that i use

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,199
that being code

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,240
and the computer and you know other

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,320
otherwise binary digital tools to create

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,560
things that kind of encourage a

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,360
broadening of our conception of what

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
here

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
versus there might mean um as well as

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,120
you know what actually generates

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,880
sensation in our bodies

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,320
um we're so used to thinking of

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,960
sensation through

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
the conduit of physical touch but things

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,440
are not

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,880
always so explicit i'm very

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,120
very curious about how technology can be

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
used to get us back in touch with

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
ourselves

00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,319
our bodies our present kind of state

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,240
so often we hear about all the ways

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,560
that technology disconnects us from each

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,880
other and from ourselves and so

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,759
i became interested over the years in

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
exploring

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,919
the ways in which it might also be used

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,759
to kind of do the opposite

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,600
um in particular i'm really

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,199
into textures and playing around with

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,039
the look and feel of things so again

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,120
shaders come in handy here

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,199
but you know making something that

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,639
simultaneously generates both

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,039
a feeling of like familiarity but also

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,360
uh alien like it feels alien enough that

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,080
we're provoked in some way and so

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,919
the idea is to confront those two

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,400
feelings those two sensations

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,880
um and there's a certain charm too i

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,120
think to creating something that evokes

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,479
uh the natural world even if it's just

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,400
like really subtly

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,639
but doing that was such a clunky tool as

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,199
like code and a computer

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,479
you know but yeah this seems to be the

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,599
key i've discovered

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:01,440
or at least one of them

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,800
so this is a one of my earlier pieces

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,240
it's a jiggly

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,160
well a jiggly pie and it got a really

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,880
great response when i first showed it

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,639
people didn't quite know what to make of

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,840
it

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,840
we're not sure how they felt about it

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,160
and so you know back to what i was

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,039
saying like i found a key but the key to

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,919
what

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,199
while to jarring people essentially just

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,800
enough that their head kind of like

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,080
 the side a bit and maybe their

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
senses tingle

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,039
you know in such a way that um uh

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,960
that they find themselves called back to

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,599
present even if it's just for like one

00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,919
second

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,440
uh it's that second that destabilizes

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
the psyche and kind of tickles our

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,800
intuition and

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,680
makes us wanna you know reach out and

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,639
touch what we see

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,000
and yeah so the digital hands in these

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,879
images are

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,160
um projections of my own hands being

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,039
tracked in real time

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,759
by a sensor um you'll also probably have

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,440
noticed

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,919
a bit of a bubble theme throughout my

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,639
work i really like soft squishy things

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,520
um touchability if that's a word is

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
really

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,759
important to me there's also this

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,319
quality to bubbles that seems to kind of

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,200
induce

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,599
immediate wonder in people i remember

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,839
being in california at golden gate park

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,880
last year and there was this man who had

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
set up shop

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,880
on the grass making these huge massive

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,360
bubbles and i mean like

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,000
body size bubbles like adult body size

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,519
bubbles

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,040
and kids would come running up to them

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,600
and try to catch them

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,440
and adults did too and you just had all

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,040
these people young and old kind of like

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,000
running around on the grass with their

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,920
hands in the air

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,120
um trying to catch those bubbles and

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,120
everyone was laughing

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,200
there's such a moment of pure happiness

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
it was like just really cute and nice to

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,240
see

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,200
and so bubbles i mean they kind of have

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,040
this really

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,800
irresistible pull to them so yeah

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,640
that's the hope basically the hope is

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,519
that people are enticed into reaching

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,560
out and reaching

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,000
into or feeling drawn in you know in a

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,680
way

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
and maybe it's that feeling that they

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,519
can't quite describe

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
they don't really know what it is that

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,600
they're feeling but they know that

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,760
they're feeling something

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,640
i got that a lot with this demo too this

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
is to

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,160
furry bubbles um and the different

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,040
textures of

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,279
fur of hair really threw people off so

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,680
i'd say that um

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,080
so far i'm not you know totally failing

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,160
in my endeavor i've gotten a lot of

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,839
fun feedback from people that my work

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,120
made them feel weird which to me is the

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,399
highest compliment

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,480
um and i've also gotten that same kind

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,720
of feedback from people who

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,720
have seen but not directly experienced

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,240
having their hands projected into the

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,480
parallel world

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
which is so great i mean to me it means

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
that i really

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,160
kind of accessed that asmr space

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,519
and um yeah having a physics engine to

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
mess around with definitely helps with

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,480
that because

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,240
you can you know take the rules of the

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,959
natural world and just kind of mess with

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,600
them

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,959
you know but on the topic of touch some

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,079
people actually don't you know

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,360
like being touched and still want

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,480
that proximity that closeness to others

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,720
this is a project that i've been working

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
on with two other artists enos alpha and

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
marpy who are

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,040
two really awesome and mega talented

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,000
humans

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,760
the project is called super morphia and

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,920
it basically

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,160
kind of indirectly ponders this question

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,480
in the most colorful way possible

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,200
we wanted to combine all of our

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,760
aesthetics

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,160
maintain that same kind of you know

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,720
eerie but familiar vibe that shows up

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,680
in marpy's work as it does in mine and

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,480
create some unique 3d makeup which is

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,839
specialty um her aesthetic is also

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
pretty out of this world like

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,519
in the best way so it was just a lot of

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,839
fun to work on this

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,079
all together and we ended up designing

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,880
something that basically allows us to

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,760
draw the makeup right onto our faces as

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,760
well as

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,440
on each other's faces without ever

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,640
touching them so

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,040
that physical boundary is maintained um

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,640
and yeah this is a bit of a departure

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,760
from the face filters that social media

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,399
has made us all

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,040
so familiar with i think at this point

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,519
because

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,399
here we're really selecting and applying

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,160
the makeup

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,600
kind of like however and wherever we

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,800
want on our face

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,680
um so yeah

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,079
here we're basically presented um with

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,360
this

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,560
idea uh of sensation elicited from

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,519
kind of implicit instead of explicit uh

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,440
interaction

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,519
and here i'm talking about interaction

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
of course between two physical bodies

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
because of course

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,880
you know we're interacting with the

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,760
computer um but there's also just this

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,240
perception of

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,680
of how a certain type of makeup feels

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,279
versus

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,279
another when experienced through the

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,160
screen but also on my face

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,279
um like in our our case we chose three

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,560
types of makeup

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,440
um let me go back the previous slide

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,880
because i think it's clearer yeah uh we

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,079
chose three types of makeup

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,160
um each with their own kind of vibe like

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,959
stiff diamonds jiggly bubbles because of

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,920
course

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,839
um insinuous kind of flowery vines yeah

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,519
there's something

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,279
just really special about applying it

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,519
yourself um and

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,680
yeah it's been a really wild ride trying

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
to get all of this to render in real

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,440
time

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,839
properly but it's been really fun and

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,279
we all learned a lot and so yeah digital

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,920
playgrounds there are

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,680
no rules and you get to work out what

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,040
the experience is for yourself and if

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,360
you spend enough time

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,360
playing with the makeup you might um let

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,279
me show you that video again you might

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,279
discover that you can connect to the

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,440
other person with your makeup

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,079
um and so you know you're touching each

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,000
other without touching which elicits

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,440
you know its own hostess sensations and

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,120
everyone is different so

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,519
the sensations are super personal and

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,399
individual like here you're going to see

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,320
enos and i connect to each other via the

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,160
same kind of little tendril there and

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,200
then we can pull it apart and

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,440
it just wants it wants to touch so yeah

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,480
that was a fun little detail we

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,399
discovered

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,800
um so yeah another idea

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,959
that's pretty front of mind for me these

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,639
days is kind of just that notion of

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,120
being in two places at once

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
um because you've got a kind of portal

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,000
situation happening with this kind of

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,399
technology right where you're

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,680
transposing yourself or part of yourself

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,240
at least

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
in real time into digital spaces that

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,519
are kind of parallel to ours you know

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,399
worlds just beyond so

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,440
to me xr as a concept really allows for

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,360
that to exist

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,120
and be explored um to be able to be

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,680
where i am here now but also be in there

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,560
in that somewhere in that scene touching

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,560
something

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,320
um which creates a sensation that i can

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,399
feel in my body here

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
now right like that's what i'm talking

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,560
about um

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
let me show you a clip from from a show

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,959
that i did in

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,480
san francisco last year um

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,440
there we go one of my favorite things to

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,959
witness when i get

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
you know to see people play with my work

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,240
is how quickly they kind of get wrapped

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,760
up in the moment

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,279
and forget that they're in a public

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
space and that there are other people

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,040
around

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
um so it's it's nice to see that kind of

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,760
like letting go

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,079
and you see it a lot in interactive

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,320
pieces that play on mirroring movement

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,959
um back to you in a slightly off-kilter

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,279
way adults kind of turn into kids again

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
and it's just so great like for a moment

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
they access

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,839
this really inquisitive kind of

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,839
intuitive space of wonder

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,919
[Music]

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,920
yeah so here's a little montage of

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,560
people's

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,360
hands from the show that you just saw a

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,440
video of

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,639
um to showcase the many approaches

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
people have

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,000
when confronted by something like you

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,680
know the furry bubbles you just saw

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
um i get a kick out of this slide

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,440
because it's always super fun to see how

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,240
people engage with your work

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,839
and also it just kind of drives home the

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,680
point that everyone

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,680
approaches things so differently and

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,519
plays differently and that that's

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
totally fine and in fact that's kind of

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
the point so

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,639
you know to feel out how you want to

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,560
approach something foreign that appears

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
alien but also inviting and

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
there's just something about doing this

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,839
outside of the confines of a headset

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,720
that to me really adds

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,720
the experience i truly appreciate

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,440
sensors and computer vision technology

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,040
for that

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,199
because here what's capturing people's

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,000
hand movements is a leap motion sensor

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,680
which you can't really see but um i love

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
using the sensor with projected artworks

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,120
because suddenly there's this like

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,880
like i said there's this window into

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
another world and you can interact with

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,120
that world and

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,199
not like is a shadow figure and an

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,160
invisible force but part of your body is

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,759
in there

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,519
but it doesn't quite move the same and

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,279
so it might solicit some surprising

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,480
feelings from you again

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,920
um like that's the goal right

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,120
and yeah i have a really great clip

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,440
i'd like to share an extended clip from

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,639
the same show of one of the attendees

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
kind of experiencing

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,680
um all of the feels like she goes

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,839
through the gamut and

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,480
i think it just really illustrates what

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
i'm trying to say

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
properly

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,480
so yeah she comes up she's kind of she's

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,160
not sure

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,120
she's curious but confused um

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,039
reticent a little bit but still like

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,839
intrigued

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,079
and then she kind of lets go i just love

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,120
all of her facial expressions

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,120
um it's great

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,400
so i've had the immense chance to play

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,600
around with some of the looking glass

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
technology as well

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,280
which gets me really excited because i

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,320
was raised on star trek

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,520
um so anyone who says hologram to me

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,280
gets my attention pretty fast um and so

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,039
this is me playing around with their ak

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,240
screens which are pretty impressive

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,679
um say the least and again here using

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,000
the leap motion to kind of

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,880
reach into a parallel space and

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
influence

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
whatever i might find in there here's

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
kind of

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,679
looking into a void but we have a riff

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,919
on my hairy bubbles

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,440
i made them extra thick for the occasion

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,559
it was a lot of fun and it was

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,400
as i was starting to um play around with

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,080
looking glass that i really started

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,240
kind of um toying with this this notion

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,919
um that i kind of demo with this example

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,919
um the idea of breaking the fourth wall

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,480
it kind of started creeping into my work

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,440
slowly you know just this idea that the

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,559
camera lens

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,720
in three the 3d scene might also be

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,000
like a window right in both directions

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,799
because why not

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,280
like why is it just us looking in um

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
isn't

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
that how portals usually work anyways

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,240
like they go in both directions

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,440
um so yeah i just like the idea of

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,720
that world also kind of being able to at

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,080
least feel the border

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,200
between our two worlds um

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,440
so yeah maybe it isn't just about us

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,280
kind of reaching in only but also of

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
them kind of understanding that there's

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,640
a reaching happening

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,919
and that there might be something beyond

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,720
that wall

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,520
um this is kind of a smaller looking

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,679
glass device

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,280
and yeah here i'm just kind of like i

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,799
said inserting my hands into this whole

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,720
other space that contains these like

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,320
bubbles that can't escape and it's

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,280
a simple enough idea um

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,559
but it kind of planted a third question

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,640
in my mind

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,080
um what if we kind of flipped everything

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,760
that i've been saying on

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,880
its head and um

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,799
instead of giant hands descending

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,039
into a parallel world giant bubbles kind

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,360
of emerged from a parallel world and

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,400
came

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,120
and arrived and landed in hours so in

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,679
the case of a piset which is

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
a building structure here in paris in a

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,080
part of paris it doesn't really look

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,760
very much like paris um i adapted one of

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,640
my projects where normally like you saw

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,720
you'd be able to

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,000
kind of reach in and touch the bubbles

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,799
with your hands

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,320
um and actually just for fun i'll show

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,880
you a clip from burning man from last

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,640
year

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,000
where i was able to put my hands up on a

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
huge surface and

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,200
and it really worked out with the play

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:09,280
on on scale it was pretty fun

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,640
uh so yeah we basically set up a leap

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,919
motion sensor

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,600
um on a tiki torch and i found

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,720
some really long cables

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,159
and got every work everything working

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,880
and it was just a really special place

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,200
to show art and

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,200
especially being that i chose to put the

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,919
eyeball up on the pyramid and the nature

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,919
of the gathering

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,120
yeah it made for some really funny

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,640
conversations i got a lot of hugs

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,159
tonight but uh yeah

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,880
given the nature of the screens for the

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,400
exhibit

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,720
at uh episodes i opted to kind of

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,799
swap out human hands and use the

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,320
building as the interactive element

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,080
instead of humans um it felt like the

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
perfect place to kind of try out that

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,919
idea

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,240
right of of of the other world arriving

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,320
in ours and kind of implanting in hours

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,400
um the facade was made up of

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
screens that were organized in a pretty

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,760
exceptional way

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,840
at least in my experience so i found it

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,320
really fun as an idea to kind of

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,640
you know allow the building to take

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,799
center stage i saw um

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,679
i saw it almost as kind of like a

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,799
labyrinth

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,640
um where bubbles could kind of like you

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,919
know wander and bounce around and sneak

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,280
past corners and

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,559
come up against the street side of of

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,480
the the screen as well uh or kind of

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,400
i guess what appears to be like a window

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,679
between our two worlds

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,120
um and just kind of experiencing it from

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,520
that vantage point

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,400
i just like the idea of it not being um

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,520
one-sided

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,919
i guess uh and you know

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,919
there's also i guess this theme of like

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,880
bouncing off the walls that just became

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,360
ever-present over the last year in my

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,559
work

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,400
um and at one point

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,679
yeah over the last couple months or i

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,039
guess over the last year

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,400
um i got kind of overwhelmed with

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
everything that was happening around me

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,440
right in the world and

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,679
it seemed like life had kind of turned

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,760
into this weird um

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,280
bad blockbuster i don't know really what

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,600
genre properly fits

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,640
um to describe the year that it's

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,200
currently winding down

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,200
but i was in it and feeling like i don't

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,600
know i just wanted to like get out but

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,360
you know there's no there's no exit so i

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,080
guess i kind of translated that into my

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,000
work a little

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,240
too it wasn't super conscious at the

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,840
time at all

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,559
but this facade my work was shown

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,640
just after the government in france kind

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,480
of started to allow spaces to open up

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,159
again this summer so it felt very

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,840
appropriate to show this work there and

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,120
i just found that the facade would

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,799
really kind of highlight this all

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,520
beautifully like the fishbowl kind of

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,280
feeling

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,960
that i had experienced at certain points

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,720
of the last year but also

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,320
you know that of being out in the world

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,919
again and of kind of like

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,919
a foreign kind of alien uh

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,360
entity arriving and kind of implanting

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,360
in ours it felt like yeah

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,559
kind of the perfect spot to try it out

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,840
and so

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,080
anyways um that's a bit of a tangent but

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,039
i really like the idea of our art as

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,159
architecture

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,760
um perspective and depth

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,360
and those kinds of mind-bending um

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,440
opportunities kind of set the stage

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,280
perfectly for that for that portal

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,720
feeling and i was talking

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,919
about that before um i guess here uh

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,080
this would be an example of when a

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,520
portal was one-sided but sometimes

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,720
they're one-sided i guess that's like an

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,039
artist's choice right but

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,760
at burning man you could definitely see

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,480
um

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:42,000
that it works uh you can definitely like

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,600
throw your hands up and have them be

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
like eight times as big as your body and

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,159
that'd be

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,279
an amazing experience scale is like a

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,559
really fun

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,960
fun parameter to play with when it comes

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,440
to

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,000
eliciting weird feelings uh in people so

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,480
yeah using technology to kind of trigger

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,320
our own awareness of our senses

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,240
depth perception of space scale um

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,080
i almost honestly like to think of it as

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,159
kind of like tearing

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,760
a hole in reality um

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,360
and kind of getting a peek at like

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,400
what's beyond the veil

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,400
or like the facade literally right um

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,840
and also kind of just from an

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,000
imaginative space there's

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,520
so much we can do with that um

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,240
especially these days like everything

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,640
feels

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
so unreal so surreal like whatever your

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,960
brand of real is at the moment

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,400
um there are all kinds of conversations

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,559
floating around about i don't know how

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,080
we're living a simulation or whatever

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,919
and again like however you might

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,039
approach that flavor of thinking

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,120
i find it just kind of

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,080
interesting to play with these concepts

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,559
in a more

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,080
uh tangible but fantastical kind of way

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,000
i guess like make it fun

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,760
make it colorful approach things

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,520
playfully

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,799
highlight the ways that we can use

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,080
technology in more

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:03,039
playful ways that connect us to

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,960
ourselves because we get to decide how

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,960
we use it and what we make with it

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,520
and working with 3d and xr and like all

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,559
the gadgets and devices in that way like

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,320
rethinking how we can kind of be

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,400
in this overlap and how we can move

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,799
within it to me it's a very

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,919
free and open kind of space or at least

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,600
like it can be

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,039
it's really up to us like how we choose

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,480
to use the technology

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,039
at our disposal um and what we choose to

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,360
kind of

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:33,919
explore with it so yeah

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,960
for me i choose you know more of a

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,159
playful

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,000
intuitive kind of space and just

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,679
you know opting to push back a bit i

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,799
guess against all the ways

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,200
that we use technology against ourselves

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,679
um consciously or not and just kind of

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,919
um choosing to flip the script in my own

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,400
little way and putting technology

00:25:51,919 --> 00:26:00,159
at the service of our senses so

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,240
yeah thank you for coming to my session
