00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,639
hi everyone

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
my name is ash her i'm a multimedia

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,560
artist and creative technologist

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,760
i work in augmented reality and i think

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,320
ar is one of the most

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
exciting mediums for modern day artists

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,800
before

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,400
ar even came along artists have always

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,920
been interested in breaking down the

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,160
boundaries between natural

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
and artificial realities which largely

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,120
parallels the work being done in ar

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
today

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
but apart from art there are so many

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,680
other use cases for ar

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,079
and the principles of what makes a

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
magical ar experience is universal

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,280
so whether you're creating an art

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
installation an app

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,960
an interactive birthday card or a game

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
i'm here to share with you today

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,120
how to create those great mobile ar

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
experiences

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,559
so at a high level there are presently

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,520
two types of mobile augmented reality

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,520
experiences

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,280
you're either augmenting an object or

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,199
you're augmenting a place

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,559
augmented objects are things like face

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,960
filters or

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,560
making a poster card or some other 2d

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,159
screen come to life

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
augmented places are things like

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,000
location-based tours

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,640
visualizing furniture in a space or

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,640
creating a fictional narrative

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,240
regardless of what you are augmenting

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
there are four elements that you will

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,040
need to consider in developing these

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,000
experiences

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,200
they include considerations for screen

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,799
environment

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
motion and illusion

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,360
one of the most common challenges for ar

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,079
projects are the constraints

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,799
set by the screen up until now our 2d

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,119
interfaces

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,320
were primarily used for controlling 2d

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,159
interactions

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,759
now a touch screen serves three purposes

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,840
for your 2d interactions as a 3d cursor

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,960
and as a viewing window for your ar

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
experience

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
and while it's tempting to call ar an

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,079
immersive experience

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,399
we're still constrained by the limits of

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,840
our screen and because the screen is a

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
window to our new world

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,159
it's important to maximize the visual

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,280
display of it having too many controls

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,880
clutters the interface

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,560
and it distracts from the augmented

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,120
experience

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
so keep the screen simple and consider

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
hicks law

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,440
where the need to make decision

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
increases with the number and complexity

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,720
of choices

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,599
if we want our users to prioritize our

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,840
experience

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
it's best to provide a simple and clean

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,959
interface for the user to easily digest

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,959
it

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,040
here i'm showing the adobe aero

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,400
interface which i think does a good job

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,680
of maximizing ar

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,200
screen space another screen related

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,040
consideration is the comfortable to

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,560
reach areas on a device

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,879
it's best to place your important

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,800
controls in these easy to reach areas

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,480
and lately more apps are utilizing the

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
bottom of the screen for these important

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,760
controls

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,200
here are some examples where the primary

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,599
interaction elements in augmented

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,319
reality are located in those easy to

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,319
reach areas

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,760
the second consideration is that mobile

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
ar is an environmental medium

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,800
and because of the environmental

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,959
variability in which users will

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,200
experience your ar it's always good to

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,959
set expectations for what is required in

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
the experience during onboarding

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,680
so when your user is getting started set

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,959
expectations on the ideal conditions for

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,440
using your ar

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,560
like defining the amount of space needed

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,879
or if there should be

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,879
more than one user participating this

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,200
will prime your user for the best ar

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,040
experience as you intended it

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,959
you can also provide contextual guidance

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,599
if the environment is not good enough

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,360
ar core and ar kit both have built-in

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,360
systems for light estimation

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,959
so if the environment is too dark or too

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,799
bright you can tell the user that they

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,159
can try to find a better place to use

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,760
your ar

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,680
on the screen here i'm showing two

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
examples where the user is asked to set

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,319
up the

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,840
scene correctly for the experience on

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,840
the left side of the screen the user is

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
asked to use the back facing camera

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,040
and on the right side of the screen the

00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,080
user is being asked to bring in

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,840
another individual into the experience

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
these are examples from mobile apps in

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,760
ar that i think do a good job

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
host separate app is reminding the user

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,920
to stay alert of their surroundings

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,239
and the ar runner app here is asking you

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,000
to choose the size of your play area

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
and the light space app here has an

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,400
effective video tutorial for using their

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,959
app

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,800
and i think these apps do a good job in

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,800
easing their user into the ar experience

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
your environmental situation also

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,600
influence how users interact within your

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,160
ar there are generally two categories

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,479
here

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
it's either an experience for a private

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,160
environment

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,479
or a public one in a private environment

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,199
like

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,120
at home or at work you can create longer

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,320
user sessions with more complex

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
interactions

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,240
here you'll also find that users are

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,639
more willing to utilize their whole body

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,720
for movement within the interactions

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,800
portals are a good example of ar that

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,440
thrives in private environments

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
ar portals encourage the user to explore

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
and move around the real world

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,360
to discover different elements of the ar

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,880
scene these generally take a bit more

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
time to get through especially when

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,680
you're thorough

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,520
on the other hand there are public

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
environments like the outdoors where

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,639
users are partial to shorter user

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,160
sessions

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,160
this doesn't mean that long sessions

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,479
should be out of question but it's good

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,320
to have a balance between your 2d and 3d

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,280
screens so that a user isn't too

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
fatigued

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,320
pokemon go is a really good example of

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,240
this

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
these interactions within our mobile ar

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
window brings me to my next

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,479
consideration

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,479
which is motion we need to be mindful of

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,639
how our user will be navigating in our

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
ar experience

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,120
in mobile ar there are four main ways in

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
which a user moves within the ar space

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,680
they're either seated with their hands

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,080
fixed seated with their hands moving

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,360
standard or moving around in a real

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,880
world space

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,880
but regardless of how the user is

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,320
positioned they will need to be holding

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
a device in their hands

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,520
and these device types will also vary

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,560
creating a new challenge for

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,639
accessibility

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,240
an iphone 8 would be much easier to hold

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,479
than an iphone 12 pro

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
which is easier to hold than an ipad

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,600
holding a device for longer periods can

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
be fatiguing

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
especially after the 30 second mark

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,520
therefore as a result

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,600
many great ar experiences have shorter

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,520
sessions or built-in periods of downtime

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,280
during the experience

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,800
one more thing to consider is that the

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,960
context in which your user will be

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,880
utilizing their ar experience matters

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,880
for example an ar experience inside a

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,840
grocery store may need to account for a

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,919
user that would be

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,680
holding a basket or pushing a cart in

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,280
addition to holding their device

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,360
another example is that if your

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
experience is at an art gallery is

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
likely that the user wouldn't need to

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
hold the device

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,160
at all and so these factors would

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
influence your users ability to navigate

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,759
within your ar space and how you present

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,759
motion within the experience

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,400
another good practice for motion and ar

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,560
is to guide the user through the types

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,919
and ranges of movements possible for the

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
ar experience

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,360
this can be accomplished without

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,000
sacrificing screen space by utilizing

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,960
visual

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,199
motion and animation cues not only do

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,960
cues inform the user of what elements

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
are designed to be interacted with

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
these visual cues also act as an

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,479
accessibility option for users who would

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,919
be hard of hearing

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,400
the example i'm showing on the screen

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,639
here is of squishy hoops and ar game

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,319
where they do a really good job of

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,400
introducing the different interactive

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,919
actions that a user can take

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,919
during their ar experience

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,479
so speaking of the different cue types

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
an example of a visual cue

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,880
would be like highlighting recommended

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,400
options or showing text that encourages

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,880
you to follow a command

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,639
or placement guides for the tracking and

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,319
placement of 3d objects

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,840
the examples that i'm showing on the

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,599
screen here are both of instructional

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,840
text

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,759
so motion cues are more prominent in

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,680
face filters where a user would be

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
expected or instructed to move their

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,080
head or open their mouth to trigger

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,599
interactions within your ar experience

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,120
in the examples that i'm showing here

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,720
the user is being asked to turn their

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
heads which is also

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,840
a natural movement especially when it

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,840
comes to face filters

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,479
lastly a good example of an animation

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
queue is like the fox that was in google

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,520
maps ar

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,520
here a fox would walk in front of you

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,280
and help you navigate where to turn

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,680
i don't believe that this is still a

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,160
feature in google maps ar today

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,919
but the subtle animations like these

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,120
highlighted arrows do the job

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,560
just as well

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
there are also times when you would

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,320
choose not to include instructions

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
as to encourage the user to move and

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
discover the experience on their own

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
more often this is seen in art

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,080
installations or ar that is designed to

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,839
be more experimental

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
and lastly let's talk about the most

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,880
important aspects of augmented reality

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,480
the illusion regardless of the aesthetic

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,040
or style that you're going for

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,640
ar objects that engage with and reflect

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,279
their environment are the ones that make

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,519
ar

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,800
magical incorporating things like

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,120
shadows lighting

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,760
occlusion reflection and collision all

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,480
support the illusion of your ar

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,680
for 3d objects attention to detail

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
really matters

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,200
for models that you want to look real

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,920
use physically based rendering texture

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
models

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
add visual noise to a texture so that

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
it's not just a repeating pattern

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,959
and utilize normal maps to achieve a

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,560
more realistic look

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,399
it's also important to note that these

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
objects can get heavy so it's best to

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,240
minimize the size of these textures as

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,680
much as possible so that your scene can

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
load faster

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,959
you can reduce the size by using

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
compression tools like draco

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,480
or reducing the polygon count of your

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,399
objects furthermore

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,399
light and shadow are also critical in

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,240
creating realism in ar

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,080
so be sure to reflect environmental

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,040
lighting conditions onto your virtual

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
objects

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,560
cast object shadows and add reflections

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,600
onto surfaces

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,200
to create that more realistic look i

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
found that the best place to position

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,320
light sources

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,760
is overhead at the 12 o'clock position

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
and it's also likely to be more

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,000
congruent with the lighting conditions

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
that of your user as opposed to

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,839
directional lighting

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,000
lastly sound is also a wonderful way to

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,519
delight in ar by setting the scene

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
creating a mood and adding to the

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,200
illusion you can also use sound to guide

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
your user around the virtual space

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,360
or as a tool in confirming interactive

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
elements within your 3d space

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,040
as you can see there are many ways and

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
combinations in creating engaging

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,760
augmented reality

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
there's also so much more here on

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,760
building great ar experiences

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,680
in regards to shaders textures

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,160
animations and interactions

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,640
but that is a talk for another day today

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,200
we spoke to considerations for screen

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,200
environment motion and illusion factors

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,519
in building your ar experience

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,920
and keep in mind ar is still evolving

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,760
and there is so much more to be created

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,959
so if you're interested in creating an

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,560
augmented reality

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
there are a number of great tools out

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
there to help you get started on the

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
right track

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,120
i'll speak to several of these

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,519
development tools first

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
so first we have ar core which is free

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,880
and their latest version allows for

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,839
cloud anchors motion tracking

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,800
environmental understanding light

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,360
estimation which isn't really

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,320
different from what ar kit also offers

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,959
and but the ar kit sdk is limited to ios

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,279
devices and also offers people occlusion

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,120
simultaneous front and back camera use

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,000
multiple face tracking and collaborative

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,839
sessions as an advantage to ar core

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,160
and then we have unity which has a

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,240
really robust toolkit for ar development

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,560
called the unity ar foundation

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,279
which includes core features from ar kit

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,760
ar core

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,760
magic leap and hololens and what's

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,279
unique about the ar foundation is that

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,360
they let you take currently and

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,560
available features with you whenever you

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,800
switch between ar

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,480
platforms so if a feature is enabled on

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,480
one platform but not another they'll

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,000
help you transition so that whenever

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
you are switching platforms you're not

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
rebuilding the ar experience from

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,720
scratch

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,880
and then we have lens studio by snapchat

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,360
which is also incredibly robust and also

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,600
has

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,519
good documentation to get non-developers

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,440
started in augmented reality

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,839
another pro with lens studio is that you

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,120
can quickly deploy your ar and snapchats

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,279
to its large user base and lastly i'll

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,600
talk about spark ar which is facebook's

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,680
ar platform i've been using spark ar

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,279
more often as of late and similar to

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
lens studio spark ar

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,200
is also really great because much of the

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,600
ar infrastructure is already built for

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,440
you

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
and it's an easy way to distribute and

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,680
share your work as it publishes your ar

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,120
experience to its users on facebook and

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,880
instagram

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
next i'll speak to some of the other

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,279
tools that are more focused on creating

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,120
the 3d content within your ar experience

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,120
i won't be speaking to all of them in

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,320
the interest of time but i'll start here

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
with sketchfab

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,240
and sketchfab is a really great platform

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,639
for discovering 3d objects

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,560
you can purchase or even find free 3d

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,920
models to download here and incorporate

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
into your ar experience

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,959
there are a ton of really great models

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,959
here

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,120
and here we have quill and tilt brush

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,600
which are both vr drawing tools

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,279
where you can create 3d models animate

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
them and then incorporate that into your

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,959
ar

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,600
you can also get some pretty cool

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,560
workflows here

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,120
and lastly here blender and cinema 4d

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,279
are both

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,360
incredibly powerful 3d graphics tools

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,360
for rendering animation and modeling

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
blender is awesome because it's free and

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,760
incredibly powerful i've used it for

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
modeling

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
sculpting rigging and rendering some of

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,200
the 3d models that i've used in my ar

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
but both of these tools are really

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,800
really incredible i'll close with this

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
quote here and i encourage you to go

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,160
and create an ar create those

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,000
experiences that are worth sharing

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,680
thank you so much for watching feel free

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,279
to keep in touch i would love to see the

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,399
things that you make in ar

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,079
hope you enjoy the rest of your

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,839
conference and thank you for tuning in

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,839
take care

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
