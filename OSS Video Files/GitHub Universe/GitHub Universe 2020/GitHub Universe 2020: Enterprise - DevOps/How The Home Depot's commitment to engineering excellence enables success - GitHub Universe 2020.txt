	00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,120
we

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,840
are both thrilled to be here today and

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,240
uh

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,519
i will i will kick off by saying my name

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,760
is angie brown

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,800
and i am a vice president of information

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,320
technology at the

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
at the home depot i currently have

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,720
responsibility for a merchandising

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
organization it's a little bit of

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,960
background i've actually

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,640
been with home depot now for

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
more than two decades which is pretty

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
unusual to hear i started as an entry

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
level or

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
level developer in the organization

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,559
right out of college

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,120
and have obviously done a variety of

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,079
different

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,239
roles and responsibilities since then i

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,800
spent a number of years in store space

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,480
as well

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,399
developing software solutions to our

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,399
stores like i said i currently have a

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,000
merchandising organization

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,760
i think we got alice back as well but

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320
before we maybe turn it back over to you

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,359
alice um maybe we let tony

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,680
introduce himself and then uh we'll get

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,080
right over to you

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
of course i love how angie and alice are

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,040
just swapping interchangeably this is

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,200
great

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
um yeah thanks for having me uh my name

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
is tony mccully i've been at the home

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,680
depot

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
for over seven years now i've been in

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,799
the industry

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
20 years which sounds crazy to me to say

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,759
that now

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,759
um i started in development have a

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,960
background in ux

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,720
product engineering i started in

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,240
development at home depot but i moved

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,600
over to the enterprise architecture

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,520
group and

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,000
i am now in the technology enablement

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,280
group where i currently manage

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
something called the orange method which

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
is our in-house training and sort of

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,799
research arm for

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,799
technology enablement um excited to be

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,880
here thanks for having me

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
great thank you so um both so much and

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,759
angie for helping me recover from those

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
audio visual technical difficulties um

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,600
so

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,920
that being a challenge on its own um

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
despite the challenges of 2020

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,439
it was a successful year for home depot

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,200
um angie what can you

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,439
share about what helped make that

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,920
possible

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,560
um alice we've all been there with

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,440
technical challenges this year so

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,959
um uh in a variety of different ways and

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,480
you know kind of tongue-in-cheek home

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,720
depot is probably no different

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,560
um but when we look at 2020 we

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,480
definitely had a lot of different things

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,120
thrown our way but i would say

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,800
what helped us really this year to

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
succeed and thrive in these changing

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,760
times are is really our journey probably

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,040
started back

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,440
in 2014 on that front

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,800
which is really when we started what you

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,160
know internally we call

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,319
our agility transformation

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,800
and that's when we kicked off like

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,160
really changing how we build software

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,599
going from large projects

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,680
with a large number of people in a large

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,000
timeline to smaller balanced teams

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,920
leveraging test driven development

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,280
leveraging continuous devel

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,920
deployment um you know just a variety of

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,480
different

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
things changed in our work practices is

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
we were

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,239
moving down that agile journey

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,480
um and so when when you know this

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
concept of the muscles you need

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,680
for speed and adaptability we really

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,560
started building on

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,280
i would say back then and it's taken us

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,959
time to mature those muscles for sure

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
but then when you pivot and you look at

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,760
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,799
we had so much to take in um and

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,760
really kind of think about how we

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
keep our associates and our customers

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
safe

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,720
in these times and how we continue to

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,799
meet their needs from a shopping

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,760
experience but then like i said

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,239
um you know protect uh everybody in

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,519
these

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,599
in these pandemic times so

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,280
with one other kind of variable that got

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,120
thrown our way is with

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,959
people spending so much time in their

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,319
homes in 2020

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,040
our demand uh really

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,560
increased and like using this example if

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,720
you think about online

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,680
we you know it was like spring black

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,560
friday i mean it was black friday for us

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
in the spring and for a number of months

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
in the spring

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,000
um because we saw so much coming in from

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
a demand perspective as

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,120
as people were spending all this time in

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,600
their homes

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,720
they came up with a lot of project ideas

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
and so

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,479
when all that came in we were really

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,520
able to let our agility shine

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,919
um we did a couple of things

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,800
very very quickly i would say in a

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,880
number of

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,680
hours um you know maybe days is probably

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,280
fair but definitely less than a week we

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,880
rolled out curbside pickup

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,880
uh which was a service we had not

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,280
offered before tar stores

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,479
uh similarly we took an entire

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,919
distribution center

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,199
and we pivoted its focus uh one from

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,840
like big and bulky type deliveries to to

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,199
like to meet the demand of all these

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,600
online sales

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,080
and i think that that type of scale and

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,039
that type of pivot and change

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,000
um it wouldn't have been possible to

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,800
execute that timely

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,240
pre-r transformation so when we look at

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,280
2020 we really feel like um

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,600
it was it was uh this was not a market

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,960
or a climate that we had planned for

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
but it's absolutely kind of been a

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,680
validation for all

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,120
of the it muscles that we've been

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,919
building up over the past few years

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
awesome and angie mentioned this this

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,840
started back in 2014 so

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
tony being a part of the technology

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
enablement group what specifically

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,199
needed to change for you and your team

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,199
to help engineers be more agile

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,120
yeah it's a good question alice i think

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,080
um you know i think it's been said a lot

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,919
of times it's almost

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,840
um cliche at this point it's nothing new

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,440
but um i think it was really important

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
to just get more out of the way of our

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,240
engineers and and let them

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,840
do what they do um as mentioned earlier

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,360
we you know for me i sort of

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,759
transitioned from this enterprise

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,639
architecture group um to more of a

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,560
technology enablement or advocacy group

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,080
um so instead of centrally managing

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,080
more of these things about you know

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,280
their build tools and their software

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,479
you know development life cycle paths

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,639
and so forth

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,840
um we just started spending more time

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
trying to understand the

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,880
like treat them as users and understand

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
their challenges

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,280
um start advocating on their behalf and

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
then trying to provide them solutions

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,720
to sort of meet their growing needs and

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,720
kind of meet them where they are

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,720
so this meant approaching platforms and

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,319
infrastructure and tooling with sort of

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,120
the same

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
user-centric or product based approach

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,599
mindset that we do

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,360
everything else so like our frontline

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,080
associates and our customer facing

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
experiences

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,919
so um so we needed tooling that meant

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,639
empowering the engineers

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,479
supporting self-organization and tooling

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,520
that helped foster more collaboration

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,440
and communication

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
that's great and communication is so

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
critical like it doesn't matter how good

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,400
your tools are if your team isn't

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,680
working closely together you're not

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,639
really going to see that success

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,440
flourish

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,400
so angie to that point um scaling

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,160
business processes

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,919
is as much of a challenge if not more

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,199
than scaling the hardware

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,280
and underlying platforms so how are you

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
leading the charge on tackling those

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,319
kinds of problems and what do you

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,759
recommend to other organizations

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,759
you know there's a there's a couple of

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,599
things for us on this front like

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,680
one just a little bit of backstory on

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,039
home depot strategy on this front so

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,120
you may or may not have heard the term

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,639
interconnected retail but really

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,199
you know that that is that is a buzzword

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,720
for

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
we want our customers to have a

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
consistent experience no matter how they

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,039
choose to shop

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,080
us with the um front door of our stores

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,120
on an app in their pocket on you know a

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,199
web browser

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
uh or you know when they come into our

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,800
stores physically

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
we want them to have a consistent

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,840
experience and

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,360
yeah it's it's so hard sometimes to

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
remember this but for

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
you know most retailers this online uh

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,720
you know

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,840
things started as a proof of concept

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,479
some time ago

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,360
like is this gonna take off or not and

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,360
you know when you

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,639
when you think about that and obviously

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
the answer was yes

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,280
um you know for us at least we our two

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,680
channels

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,720
online and physical stores kind of came

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,800
up separately

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
and so like back to that scaling of

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,599
business process

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,800
we had to scale uh interconnected

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,440
consistent business process and

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,480
um and and take these disparate ones

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
from channels

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,800
and and create cohesion for our

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,800
customers and really

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,120
it's from a customer back mindset to

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,839
have that consistent shopping experience

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,279
but it definitely means looking at

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,800
business processes

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,480
and scaling them to work um you know

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
more than than what you had seen

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,600
previously so we

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,640
we started a journey that we very

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,600
you know kind of uh aptly call

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,959
commons uh to have a common journey on

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,279
some of these things and

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,240
you know for us our commons really are

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,399
grounded in the

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,040
core products of a retailer uh

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,800
you know things like what what are you

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
gonna sell at what price are you gonna

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,959
sell

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,519
um you know in in delivery and things

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,480
like that

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,080
like and so we we took some of that

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,040
logic that was spread

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,640
throughout the organization even into

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,959
selling clients

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,160
and brought them together into common

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,920
service apis

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,360
that the enterprise as a whole could

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,360
leverage and so

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
again this was streamlining the business

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,640
process um

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,040
and this this concept of leveraging our

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,600
commons is now one of our coordinates

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,360
of our technology practices we you know

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,279
and it's a forcing function for that

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,800
customer consistency

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,040
as well one challenging side of this

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,320
uh side effect for this is you know when

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,040
you're building these

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,519
uh large processes for the organization

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
um

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,480
you know an empowered engineering

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,560
culture can write a heck of a lot of

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,560
software and we're challenging our

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,760
engineers to make sure that

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,680
you know again they're they're

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,160
leveraging and reuse so

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,800
i think one of the questions um that we

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,519
had to

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
um spend some time on and truthfully

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,160
could

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,279
continue need to continue to spend more

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,720
time on

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:38,240
is how to make it easier and

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
you know for our our associates writing

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
code

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,360
our engineers to answer the question has

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
somebody already built this before

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,800
like do we have something similar in the

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
organization

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,160
you know we've definitely made progress

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,240
on that but being thoughtful

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,200
on that front the information radars

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,279
around that

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,000
is definitely i think a lesson learned

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,000
for us on that

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,320
that i mean it blows my mind thinking

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,760
about trying to scale across such a

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,680
large organization

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,040
a common strategy like that being able

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
to replicate um

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,360
software and similar use cases and

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,959
create a unified experience

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
for business associates i imagine is

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,399
included in that customer's comment so

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,720
um you've you've been on this journey

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,000
you're building up these muscles how do

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,279
you know if it's working

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,519
how do you know if you're on the right

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
path

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,959
yeah i'll i'll take that one um i think

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,640
whenever you're talking about you know

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,920
this agile journey um

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,440
or um you know this transformation

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,200
i think one of the most important things

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,279
is fostering this culture

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,880
of um continuous learning and

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,920
improvement

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,760
and you know and when you're talking

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,480
about continuous improvement it's very

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,640
difficult

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,160
to do that sometimes if you don't know

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,680
where you came from or where you started

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,760
or where you are

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
and so i think you know figuring out

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,040
what to measure

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,519
and what to improve is really important

00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
so um that's been difficult in it i mean

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,440
i think

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,360
you know almost forever but i think it's

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
changed a lot in the last few years and

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,240
and a lot of that has to do with the

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,320
work that

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
you know nepal nicole foresgrann and

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,600
gene kem and the others have done over

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,200
the years with the devops handbook and

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
accelerate so

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,880
the four key metrics that we learned

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,880
about and accelerate has been a really

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,959
liberating thing for me in my space i

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,519
mean a lot of the stuff that we used to

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,160
do

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
um that you know felt good or felt like

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,040
the right thing to do i mean for the

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,240
first time in a long time like it's

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,399
quantifiable

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,160
it's tangible and it's measurable um and

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,000
that's really liberating i mean for now

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,000
like it's allowed us to treat our

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,959
platforms and infrastructure and service

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,760
offerings much

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,920
more like a product so we can experiment

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,279
we can make hypothesis we can try things

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,600
and we can figure out what has a

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,680
positive or a negative impact

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,279
and that's been really informative and

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,240
liberating for us so

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,680
um you know for me personally i don't

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,839
know about engineer or work but i think

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,519
for me and a lot of folks on my team

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,279
um you know that reading the book

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,399
accelerate is required reading when you

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,480
join the team

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,639
i want everyone to be rooted in that the

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
four key metrics and why we're doing it

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,920
we're still on the journey we have a

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
couple of them we feel good about

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,160
um but i think you know where we have

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,760
work to do is to you know fix some of

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,000
our internal plumbing to

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,839
to make some of those other metrics uh

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
available and accurate but

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,519
um you know we're getting there um and

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,720
and i'm just on the i think on one of

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,839
the previous talks earlier i was

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,639
listening to you that get

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
github insights um it's it's sort of cut

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,360
from the same cloth right

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,320
we're really excited and following the

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,320
progress of that as well

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,639
angie do you have anything you want to

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,639
add

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,920
no i think tony did a great job um you

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,320
know

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,320
wrapping wrapping that up um

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,920
i think we're good on that one okay okay

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,320
um well so we're getting close to time

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,360
here

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,199
um and would love to hear what other

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,279
words of advice do you have for

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,399
companies that are your size or hoping

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,920
to be your size

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,760
um anything that you would have done

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,240
differently as um

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,920
other organizations seek to go on an

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,920
agile or devops transformation

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,560
um tony you want to go for definitely

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,240
make sure angie gets the last word up

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,480
i'll take that one i'll go first sandy

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,480
um

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,279
i think um for me i like i said i've

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,560
worked in a lot of startups over the

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,720
years i've worked in

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,839
a lot of large companies i you know i

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,680
think i

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
i like to tell myself i found my niche

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,639
in trying to get large companies to

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,800
behave and act like

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,160
more like well-funded startups so but

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,680
one of the things i've noticed

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,839
that's one of the stark differences

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
between startups and large companies is

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
when you're in a large company as an

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,240
engineer it can you can easily

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,360
feel sort of detached from the impact of

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,959
your work

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,040
um you know there's a lot of systems

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,440
that feed into systems and they all work

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,600
together there's these large initiatives

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,519
and i think it's really important

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,199
however you can do it to ensure that

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,240
your engineers and your product team

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,839
still feel attached to their work and

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,399
the initiatives and the impacts that

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,360
they have

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,240
so whether that be you know bridging

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
channels between

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,760
directly between users and the

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,440
engineering teams or

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,120
setting up quantifiable goals and

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
tracking progress against them and you

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,839
know

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
kind of gamifying it um you know

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
information

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
radars are really important whether that

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,920
be market research or

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,440
from your business units but i truly

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,759
feel that you know when the engineers

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,680
stay connected to the impact of the work

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,440
and they're intimately aware of it you

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,680
know they're more energized

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
they feel more responsible accountable

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,040
um and they have a larger

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,399
much larger sense of ownership and pride

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,639
in their work so i think

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
um that's i don't know how you do it i

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
think i'm sure it's different every

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,560
company but

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,000
for me personally i think that's that's

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,079
one of the biggest things that i would

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,759
recommend is ensuring your engineers

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,519
feel really connected to what they're

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,720
doing and the value of it and

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,720
how it impacts the company

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,519
awesome there's um i mean honestly alice

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,240
there's

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,360
there's probably a a number of things

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,199
that come to mind

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,240
on this um but i would say

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,880
fundamentally probably an overarching

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,000
statement

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,920
is you know when when you talk about

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,279
an agility transformation or anything of

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,720
that nature it is

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,519
it is you need to approach your business

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,600
with an agility mindset and ensure that

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,279
you are looking at it across all facets

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,720
of the organization

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:36,399
um not just within technology and

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,440
i we're definitely they are now

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,279
in the very early stages we always had

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,480
our senior leadership and executive

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,600
leadership support

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,160
as we went through our transformation

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,480
but you know it hits you in a number of

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,279
different ways

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
i mentioned i was in stores uh store

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,880
engineering for a while

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,639
and so that is anything from you know

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,320
the cash registers that we use in our

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,880
store self-checkout whatever the case

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,360
may be

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,079
you know and these are 400 000 hourly

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
associates

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,280
that interact with our software on a

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,120
daily basis

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,439
plus all of the customers that come into

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,919
our stores and when you start thinking

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,360
about

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,520
how you are constantly

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,400
innovating in that space and giving them

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,360
functionality

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,439
along the way and you know you're

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,880
getting away from that mindset

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,600
of here's a new system and a 45 minute

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,240
class

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,760
on how to learn it to we're going to

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,440
take one small segment

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,039
of your business process and we're going

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
to reimagine that and then we're going

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,160
to reimagine the next piece

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,840
and the next piece and the next piece

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,919
and that was a mindset shift even for

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,200
our store associates

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,200
you know in in in the beginning it was

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,120
something obviously it was change it was

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,360
unfamiliar and so

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,799
you know we we got a lot of okay it's

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,679
great that you did this piece but how

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
about all this

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,000
and it was like well we'll get to it you

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,559
know we're coming but i think over time

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,039
one of the things that they learned too

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,400
was

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,520
that starting small really helped

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,320
um them to have a window to also provide

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,120
us feedback

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,400
and we were listening and so we could

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,600
truly

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,760
uh adapt and make sure that our

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
our end users love the solutions that

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,720
they were working

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,039
with and that it met their needs and so

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,840
i i think that that

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,880
um was kind of one pervasive thread that

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,679
leads a little bit

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,840
into you know this concept of

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,760
communication

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,799
um i i just cannot underscore

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,200
enough how much it is

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,240
a core tenet of a transformation and

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,480
explaining

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,360
the why uh no matter how many times we

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,400
felt like we

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,960
had communicated information

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,559
um and oh remember we talked about you

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
know we talked about this we talked

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,760
about why we're doing it

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,440
uh you know we've got a large

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,200
organization like this

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,960
people hear messages through their own

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
lenses you know they've got different

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
contexts

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,520
for that etc and so this

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,520
um this constantly come back to your

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,120
communication channels constantly come

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,880
back to how you're getting information

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,400
out constantly come back to how people

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
are interpreting it

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,880
be there to listen and repeat as much as

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,240
you you know need to and not to get

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,840
frustrated by that

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,280
you know along the way was definitely

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,880
you know i don't think you could ever

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,799
communicate um in

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,400
instances like this uh and we probably

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,000
you know in the beginning hope to be a

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,000
little bit more in the one and done

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,039
category so we had some we had some

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,480
learnings

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:45,280
on that front um and i would say

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
you know as i mentioned it's a business

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,919
transformation

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,840
it's not just a technology

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,880
transformation and i think that's

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,960
probably another

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,360
key thing that i would you know if we if

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,280
we were back in 2014

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,640
we started in technology with the

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,480
support of the business

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,080
i think we would pivot a little bit

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,280
different and start

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,640
across the company and really have

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,520
those uh partners beside

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,799
us um because how how they do work

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,280
obviously

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,039
changes as well the the customer back

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,280
mindset the test and learn

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,080
the you know small releases along the

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,760
way

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
those were changes for everybody

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,559
involved with the life cycle

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,559
and so it would have it would have

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,000
like i said in hindsight i think we

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,640
could have all started

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
the transformation journey a little bit

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,679
more simultaneously

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,320
versus technology got a little bit out

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,240
of head uh to begin with and then

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,600
partnered our business partners with us

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,159
and i think that's a

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,120
general lesson for any transformation

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,400
whether or not it's

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,240
agility or uh you know business

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,960
transformation whatever the case may be

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,919
you're writing

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,360
you're reinventing how you um have a

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,760
process in your uh

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,200
for a software business process et

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,039
cetera

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
you got to make sure that you know the

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,679
business and it leaders are

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,240
hand in hand out front leading it um and

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,400
not

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,440
it out front and the the business

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
following it because

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
for us especially you know that customer

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,480
based

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,840
customer back mindset is key and that

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,320
starts with

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,960
you know that that grounding and

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,760
listening

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,679
and understanding and knowing that what

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,799
we're doing is to deliver a phenomenal

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,039
experience to

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,159
our customers and our associates and

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,559
having that help

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
um in that transformation across our

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,720
partners

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,640
uh is is wonderful now

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,080
um i just wish like i said in hindsight

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,039
we would have started the conversations

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,159
with them

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,039
right when we were starting them

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,120
internal on technology

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,640
that's wonderful and you're obviously

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,080
right angie you can't

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,280
change one part of the business and

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,120
expect everyone else to follow

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,919
especially with such a big ship

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,520
um i imagine you didn't learn any of

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,000
this in a vacuum there's probably a lot

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,000
of different

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,919
inputs what would you recommend if you

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,799
could only tell someone to go learn from

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,480
one source

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,000
um tony already mentioned accelerate so

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
i'm going to hold you to give me another

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,240
one

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,679
oh tony should we make candy go first

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,840
i'll give andrew some time to think

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,120
about it uh i i don't know

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,480
i don't know if it's a great place to

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
learn or not but i'm a huge fan of

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,880
martin felt

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,640
martin fowler's twitter account so uh

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,919
if you uh you don't if you're not

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
subscribed to that i definitely

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,159
recommend it you'll learn everything not

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,600
just

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
agile transformation it's really

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,159
fascinating

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
i say i would say i loved um

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,000
talking to people who have been through

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,280
it i mean you know not just

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,120
a variety of different companies um in a

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,039
variety of different industries you know

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,360
making relationships on that front

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,880
and you know being able to talk to

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,159
people that were at different stages of

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,600
their maturity

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,320
you know have that community um to call

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,760
on

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,200
is is one of the key things that

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,799
agree the the reading and um

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,600
some of the individuals that tony

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,400

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,640
this

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,600
um also like i said just having those

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,120
people that you can

you can pick up the phone and say wait

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,880

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,840

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,919
