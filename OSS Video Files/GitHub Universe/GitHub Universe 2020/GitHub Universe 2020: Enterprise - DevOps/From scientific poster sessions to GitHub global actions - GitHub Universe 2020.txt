Publication date: 2020-12-10
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Enterprise - DevOps
Description: 
	Presented by Hung Brown Ton, Chief Architect, 3M Company

Why did 3M, the 115-year-old manufacturer of Post-It® Notes, Scotch® Tape, ACE™ bandages, and thousands of other known brands, adopt GitHub? Come learn how a broad group of software engineers, data scientists, material scientists, modelers, and manufacturing subject matter experts worked together to overcome a host of obstacles to bring 3M into the future. This talk will also cover 3M’s GitHub journey from nonexistence to innersource and opensource collaboration. Expect highlights like how a group PhD modelers used GitHub to democratize their models and enable new innovations.

[Music]

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,760
good morning afternoon and evening

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,200
everybody my name is hung brownson

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,799
and i'm the chief architect and lab

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
manager at r3m's

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,640
corporate research and development group

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,039
i'd like to share with you our journey

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,039
today

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,320
from scientific poster sessions to get

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,000
up global actions

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,720
how we've accelerated our digital

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,760
innovations some of you may already be

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,039
familiar with ram

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,240
but just in case here's a refresher 3m

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
sells products

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,880
across nearly 200 countries with annual

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,880
sales of 33 billion dollars

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
we are a science driven company with

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
more than 115

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,840
000 patents in our history and today

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,160
with over 60 000 products pretty diverse

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,440
portfolio

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,840
a century ago 3m's initial adventure

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,719
into

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,079
mining it was joked that our stock was

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,480
not worth two bits

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,239
shot of whiskey today that single

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,239
original stock certificate

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,359
would be worth a half million dollars

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,480
today also

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,480
uh 3m is one of 30 companies on the dow

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,520
our vision drives everything we do

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,680
it's authentic to 3m it's important part

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,840
of our purpose as an enterprise

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,759
technology advancing every company

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,920
products enhancing every home

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,920
and innovation improving every life

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,520
i'll start with technology

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,439
here you see our technology platforms in

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,400
the form of a periodic table

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,079
ranging from adhesives abrasives to

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,119
micro replications to non-woven

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,439
materials

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,159
our digital elements which include data

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
science

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,200
sensors robotics modeling and simulation

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,880
these were added recently to our

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,479
periodic table

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
yet it's more than just the breadth of

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,119
our technology that sets us apart

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,759
it's also how our scientists share and

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
combine

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,200
these technologies to solve problems in

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,240
a variety of different ways for our

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,000
customers

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,439
this is why we invest close to six

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,520
percent sixty

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,119
six percent sorry six percent of our

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,719
sales into r d

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,719
annually it'd be great to have sixty

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,120
percent

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,520
so innovation happens when we combine

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,800
various periodic table elements together

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,120
with a deep understanding of our

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
customers to develop products ranging

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,120
from materials

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,239
such as command strips scotchgard

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,959
post-it notes

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,959
the optical film found in cell phones to

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,520
digital connected solutions

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,640
as of late such as posted plus mobile

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,599
applications

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,400
our connected smart furnace filters and

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,640
to connected

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
iot safety solutions for industrial

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,760
customers

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,200
perhaps many of you are already familiar

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,280
with these products today

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,519
in your daily lives and you're probably

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
using them the breadth of our technology

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,800
sets us apart

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,080
from other companies

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,519
so how does innovation

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,319
happen at this come with these

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,400
complex set of technologies well it's a

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,560
long time three and folklore that if you

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,319
have a question

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,959
you can get it answered within three

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,400
persons if the expertise exists

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,519
somewhere within 3m

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,959
someone will know someone who will know

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,440
the answer

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,400
it is often that we collaborate via

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,400
poster sessions

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,800
this is a long history where we print

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,440
out a two by three foot poster with our

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,000
research

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,000
and potential applications we then have

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,920
folks walk around the room

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,040
to learn and ask questions about current

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,959
research

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
to take back to their own labs to see

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
what other combinations are possible

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,959
when other innovation

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,440
are possible somewhere at 3m there's

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
usually a poster sessioning happening

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,840
with recent and coveted times we've been

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,840
doing this virtually via video

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
conferencing

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,000
a challenge was posted to me a few years

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
ago

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,159
and how we can accelerate r d and

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
establish a culture of code reuse

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,439
at the time we were also embarking on

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
researching and developing

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,680
new digital and software platforms for

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
broader 3m adoption

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,159
poster sessions were not necessarily

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,040
conducive for this type of collaboration

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,320
the solution we launched github back in

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,840
january of 2018 as a common repository

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,240
in which users could search store

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,680
manage access and most importantly

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
leverage github's collaboration

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,040
capabilities to accelerate our software

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,440
use

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,120
the result since then we flipped the

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,199
model from human interface

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,560
to digital content first and

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,280
self-service

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,680
we have broken up vertical organizations

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,080
into

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,080
horizontal content domains instead of

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,040
having a one one-to-one or one-to-many

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,720
interaction

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
as with poster sessions we have now

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
moved towards a many-to-many paradigm

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,120
with github

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,759
we have put our training materials

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,600
elsewire training and user documentation

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,000
and even roadmaps into getup to

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,199
collaborate on we've extended github

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,759
from to include our ip attorneys i.t

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,479
security in the workflow itself to prove

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,280
publishing

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,280
public repos

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,320
why is this any different from other

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,080
implementations let's go a little deeper

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,320
with an example so we had a challenge

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,800
where we have a group of research

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,880
scientists with phds in math

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
and material science who develop complex

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,360
physics-based fea

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,720
models or what we call finite element

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
analysis models

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,120
these models help to analyze predict

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,720
material properties materials that you

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,120
use in your daily life today

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
we develop a platform called model hub

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
that manages the complex

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
inputs and outputs to run sophisticated

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,320
models in a high performance cloud

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,720
computing environment

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,800
at the onset it was really difficult to

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
onboard new modelers

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,240
lots of manual steps along with the

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,280
challenge of using the cloud

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,759
and a new tool set thus it was critical

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,520
that we had to remove such friction and

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
make it easier for modelers to use the

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,960
model hook platform

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,280
the solution well we naturally started

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,960
with github we're already collaborating

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,360
in the software world so how do we

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,680
onboard the monitors and the scientists

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
we developed a booster which is an

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
integration layer between github and

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,120
model hub

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
and our cloud high performance computing

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,720
engine

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,600
using github as a self-service interface

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
modelers can

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,199
create repos using existing github

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,160
templates to get started

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,080
which simplified their adoption they

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,160
could upload their models

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,160
they could test their models using pull

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,240
request which was very powerful

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
which deploy the models via web hooks

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,800
into model hub

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,720
in addition github use issues and

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,160
updates were being auto created using

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
our github apis

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,080
which then tied back to the models how

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
simple is that

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
by extending github into model hub

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,759
platform and using booster

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,520
as that interface with github we have

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,160
drastically shortened the time it took

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,360
for our modelers to onboard new models

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,680
from weeks to days we've also

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
tripled the number of models since

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
launch

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,560
launching booster with github this

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,720
spring the results have been

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,240
fabulous we've accelerated our modeling

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
platform usage

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
and more importantly we accelerate our

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,560
research

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,560
so stepping back for a second we are now

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,479
coming up

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,599
on three years to mark our github

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,840
launch it's a fun to reflect back on how

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,120
we've come a long way from that wintry

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,639
january 2018. it was a cold winter back

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,120
in minnesota

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,199
we have now organically grown through

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,039
value versus mandates this is really

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
really important as we cannot mandate

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,520
innovation

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,240
we have now have over 1400 diverse set

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,840
of users from software engineers

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
to scientists to modelers to ip

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,000
attorneys it's often said that

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
people vote with their feet at 3m we

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,520
have

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,560
over 3 200 active repos of all kinds

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,280
from software

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,280
code to models to engineering docs to

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,440
turning materials

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
github has been used across our

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,840
corporate r d

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,639
um organization to a growing list of

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,479
divisions and business functions

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,639
we are also extending our collaboration

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,479
with well-known research universities

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,560
via github sas

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,160
it's been pretty amazing i think that

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,159
github has helped us bring

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,680
us closer together across our diverse

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:41,120
communities and geography since we

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:43,279
have it's a it's been an amazing journey

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,240
you know for us to get to this point of

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,760
success

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
we've had to build partnerships along

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,560
the way with

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,000
key internal partners that may

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,640
traditionally have been viewed as

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,600
barriers

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,760
we've partnered with it security on all

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,320
things security related

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,320
from data classification to data loss

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,480
prevention to external identity access

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,200
management to two-factor authentication

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,120
and so on and so on we've also partnered

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,519
with our intellectual property attorneys

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,480
on licensing and approval process

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
one of the critical pivot points for us

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,839
was

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,920
early this year when we hosted jason

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,160
warner github cto to come and talk to

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,760
our cso and our vp of r d

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,760
these conversations really helped

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,880
broaden our perspectives on how security

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,560
and innovation

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,720
were occurring across other github

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,360
enterprise users and customers

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,959
and communities it's been said that once

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,200
you work through the two corporate

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,040
functions that start with the letter i

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,519
in this case i t security and electoral

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,040
property you are over the hump

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,200
and pretty much that's been true but

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,600
joking on the side both of these groups

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,320
are really great partners our it

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,279
organization

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,880
has been a great partner throughout this

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,920
whole time in providing us with

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,560
with github operational support what

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,399
remains

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,040
are the typical change management

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,360
challenges of user adoption of new tools

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,959
and new processes and many of our

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
traditional scientists had not

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,040
used source code control systems or

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,800
processes or been exposed to these

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,120
processes previously

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
so we continue to overcome and win them

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,839
over

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,000
with a more frictionless way of

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,040
collaborating and this has been exciting

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
for not only us in our lab but also for

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
the users

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
at large

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
speaking of culture barriers hackathons

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,560
has been a

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,640
great way to overcome them the past two

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,480
years we've hosted an annual 3m

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,480
company-wide global hackathon

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,360
this past summer we've had over 800

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,560
persons globally participating across

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,600
10 countries this photo was from 2019

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
when we could gather

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
but this past summer it was virtually

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
was all virtual do that pandemic

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,760
github was at the core of that

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,839
collaboration as both a platform

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,959
and as a sponsor with training support

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,560
and prices

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,399
you would be amazed with what engineers

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,440
and scientists are willing to do

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,760
for a github hoodie these days and thank

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
you

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,839
github for sponsoring and your support

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,440
of these hackathons kudos also to the

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,640
github account team they've been a great

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,480
supporters

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
dewakagupa particularly

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,399
so to recap github has helped 3m

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:32,480
transform in a number of different ways

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,480
by automating our three-person folklore

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,120
we still do uh poster sessions today but

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,200
we've also complemented that with

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
a github ecosystem and a collaboration

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,839
vehicle

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,279
we've enabled instantaneous

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,560
collaboration where we couldn't do that

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,279
with poster sessions

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,160
we've helped establish a culture of code

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,760
reuse

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
which was our original objective by the

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,959
way as we embarked on building these

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
digital platforms

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,240
we've also helped to protect ip while

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,519
accelerating our

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,160
r d innovations globally and we've

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,560
helped really to improve the way we work

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,320
and most importantly we've brought us

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,320
closer together across this diverse

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,720
community of scientists and engineers

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,680
and because of this we've accelerated

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
our r d

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,360
and digital innovation this is really

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,120
important and this has been exciting

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,120
part of our journey

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,639
i'm honored to be here today and thank

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,160
you for having me

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,200
thank you github for being great

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,200
