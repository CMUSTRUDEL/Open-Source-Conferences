don't touch that dial or maybe keyboard

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,180
this

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,239
is the github universe highlight show

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,239
[Music]

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,920
[Music]

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
hello everyone and welcome to the github

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
universe highlight show

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
i'm your host kyle daigle we have a

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,640
whole 15 minutes together

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,480
and i'm gonna share the best moments of

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
the day and help guide you through the

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,079
17 different talks we had

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
and hopefully you'll find a few things

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,719
that will help out your day-to-day

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,280
developer workflow

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,120
so grab a cup of water cold brew or

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
fresh squeezed kale juice

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,360
and let's dive right in this morning

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,680
eric this morning github ceo

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,359
erica brescia kicked off the conference

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,199
by talking about the importance of

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,680
developer experience and how it's at the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,000
heart of

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
everything that we do we think that all

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,600
developers deserve a great experience

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
whether you're an open source developer

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,200
using github.com

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,200
or a fortune 500 company building your

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,840
application using github enterprise

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,479
an easy to use and powerful developer

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,640
tool chain

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
is critical to being productive and

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,880
keeping you in the flow

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,200
every day and that's why focusing on

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,840
high performing teams is so important

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,079
the 2019 dora report found that elite

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,320
and high performing devops teams

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,400
are automating significantly more work

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,400
than low performing teams

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,560
in fact these elite teams are delivering

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,479
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,840
times more frequent code deployments

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,159
than those who aren't

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,560
their lead time from commit to deploy is

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,960
106 times faster

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,759
and they recover from incidents over 2

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,680
600 times more quickly

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,200
wow and with the release of github

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,840
enterprise server 3.0

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,479
github is bringing so many powerful

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
features

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
to developers in the enterprise like

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,759
code scanning

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,600
packages and actions and with these

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,240
features and in particular with github

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,239
actions

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,759
companies and teams are seeing huge

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,760
improvements to their workflows

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,800
and bringing code to production faster

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,200
than ever

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,280
across all open source repositories

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,239
repos that use actions on pull request

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,160
cprs merge 1.2 times faster

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
and the number of merged pr's increased

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,280
by 1.3 x

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,440
that's 34 more poll requests merged

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,040
this is huge in terms of improving

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,040
developer velocity

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,360
and the scales exponentially with your

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,200
team according to 3m

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,920
building with github allowed them to go

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,200
from 400 deployments in 60 days

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,480
to 6 000 deployments that's a 15

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,599
times increase in ships and yesterday we

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,120
spoke about the importance of

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
considering security

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,480
as a feature and a key part of your

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,400
development workflow

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,599
erica shared some additional information

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
about codeql

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,400
a powerful tool that lets you query your

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,959
code to find vulnerabilities

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,879
take postmates for example who leverage

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,519
codeql's code scanning to do what

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
literally

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,879
no other developer focused security

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,120
tooling can do

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,080
github security features meet developers

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,440
where they are

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,200
in the source code codeql is so

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,560
powerful if you haven't given it a look

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,560
yet i promise you

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
you really haven't used anything like

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,840
this before

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
finally we know that we're the home of

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,879
software developers

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,239
around the world github is where the

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,400
world build software

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,440
so erica took the chance to update us on

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
just how big

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,680
github has become github is where the

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,159
world builds software

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,120
over 50 million developers trust github

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,760
to collaborate

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,560
test build and deploy code including

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,840
over 70 percent of the fortune 50.

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,560
in fact in the last year over 60 million

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,640
new repo's were added and over 1.9

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,799
billion contributions were made

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
those are some seriously big numbers

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
awesome it's been

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
so cool seeing github grow over the past

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,640
seven years that i've been

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,400
here and that's because of all of you

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,319
between yesterday's keynote with matt

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,239
and today's featured session with erica

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,159
we've shown how github is powering the

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,560
developer workflows that are required

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
to build great secure software as part

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
of a team

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,720
you can check out the entire session

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,919
from erica as a replay

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,919
at githubuniverse.com tomorrow talking

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,360
about those 50 million developers let's

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,919
hear what you thought about today's

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,759
talks

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,440
there were a lot of reactions to go

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
through if you want to be featured and

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
join the conversation

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
all you need to do is use the github

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,360
universe hashtag wherever you're having

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,400
that conversation

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
okay let's dive in sarah is somehow

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,000
watching

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,240
all four channels at once really just

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,639
letting all the github content wash over

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,320
you at once i'm extremely impressed

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,320
that you can catch all that at the same

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
time maybe i could get you to join us at

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
working on the show and watching all

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,360
those streams

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,440
now here's lynne heaping praise on

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
angie's talk about visual testing

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,880
i absolutely love this talk and the

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,960
video explanation

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,720
of how easy it is to miss visual

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
mistakes we'll be talking a lot more

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,759
about this talk in a bit

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,520
and finally here is codefinity who's

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
really enjoying the code performances

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
that have been

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
happening in the play channel and

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,360
kicking off each and every day of github

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,840
universe i'm always amazed

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,919
at how quickly they can edit their code

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,160
and i'm kind of super interested to see

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,240
what a bug sounds like

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,240
share what you're thinking what was your

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,320
favorite part of github universe

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,720
use the getup universe hashtag i'd love

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,360
to feature you in tomorrow's show

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,960
alongside our featured session we had 16

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
different talks and sessions

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
all focused on improving your software

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,479
development practices and

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
making it easier to build complete

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,120
devops workflows kicking off today was

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,639
that really cool talk by angie jones

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,039
where she showed how you can

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
actually get valuable visual tests on

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,680
every pull request

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,360
without getting caught up in the pixel

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,440
by pixel comparisons

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,440
with that test catch this

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,759
no look at this test it's green

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,880
i love green like the next person but i

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,600
want my red when

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,560
when it means something you know so this

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,120
test has passed

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,039
even though with a single line of css i

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,280
literally flip this application

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,880
on its head again this is why we need

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,080
the visual testing

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,000
would you have caught all the visual

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,520
bugs without the better test go

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,080
catch her entire talk as a replay at

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,960
githubuniverse.com

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,680
our very own brian douglas or b-duggy

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,600
who is pulling double duty as a us host

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
and a speaker this year gave a talk

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
about how you can use github actions to

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
automate

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
every aspect of your day here he is

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,240
telling us about his favorite action

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,440
uh my favorite action i'm honestly i was

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,479
really stoked when i found out about the

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,160
lighthouse action

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,319
like being able to find out so whenever

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,039
i have a staging deployment on netlify

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,120
i'm able to see all my stats for just

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,120
that staging deployment so

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
previously i had to deploy to production

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
and then as once at the point of

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,440
production i could start doing some

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
regressions and testing and stuff like

00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,360
that

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,880
which is not a good practice like

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,440
definitely test that in staging

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,400
and qa that but actually applying that

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,280
directly to pr

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,520
was just mind-blowing brian did a great

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
job covering some of the powerful

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,639
and somewhat hidden features of github

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
actions and

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
if you want to learn a little bit more

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,960
about the sports game of basketball

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,080
something i assure you i am an expert on

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
check out the full talk

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
at the replay at githubuniverse.com

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,680
which is what i'll be doing

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,759
after this show have you ever been

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,479
frustrated by how long your ci bill

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,080
takes or

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,520
have you wanted to get on top of that

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,360
mountain of technical debt

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,840
today we've got a master class from

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
github's very own liz kk and keith

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,759
on how to start toppling that tower of

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,280
technical debt and focus a bit more on

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,759
how to make developers effective

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,160
inside your company and we ended up with

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,280
some big productivity wins

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,520
we did use our ci time to 13 minutes

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,479
making our ci workflow three times

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
faster

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,160
then as an added bonus we reduced our

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,639
compute cost down

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,319
by a fourth you can learn more about

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,639
this tech debt project by following

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,199
along on the github engineering blog

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,560
by going to github.blog and click on

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,560
engineering

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,319
all right we all have secrets hopefully

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,199
you're keeping your secrets to yourself

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
only telling your besties and maybe most

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
importantly

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,599
you're keeping your secrets safe in your

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,759
production workflows rosemary from

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,280
hashicorp told us about the six steps of

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,680
dealing with leaked secrets

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,000
and how secret managers prevent us from

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,919
making these mistakes at all

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
well a secrets manager actually takes

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,680
away a couple of steps

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,680
the first thing is regret you might push

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
a password and regret that you pushed it

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
in the first place

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,519
but you actually get the simplification

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,279
of the revocation and the rotation of

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,120
secrets with the secrets manager

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,399
so if you need to change the secret it's

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
no big deal

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,320
between github code scanning and a tool

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,320
like hashicorp vault i really feel like

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
i'm being protected from myself at this

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,120
point

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,800
moving on an important part of any

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,279
software project is planning and at

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,839
github

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,959
we use github to do just that lauren

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,640
bros shared how

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,160
even as product manager on the planning

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,080
and tracking team well

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,279
she has more than a few issues with

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,600
issues

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,240
now i have this sticker on my laptop it

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,000
says all my issues are on github

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
and i think that's the core of capturing

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
ideas if you're curious about how github

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,240
uses issues to build

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,080
our own product you can catch lauren's

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,720
epic talk as a replay

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,800
github actions is already the number one

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
ci cd platform on github but that

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,839
doesn't mean that we're done making it

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,920
the best tool for you to test

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,760
build and deploy your code chris

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
patterson introduced a number of new

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,399
features

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,240
to help turn you into an actions power

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,959
user and prepare you to deploy

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,040
more code than ever before we wanted to

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,920
give you a much better way to visually

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,399
track

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,399
how your workflows are progressing just

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,399
got a taste there watch the full talk to

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
see a demo of what's up next trust me

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,480
you won't regret it mostly you're just

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,279
gonna wish that you already had it today

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,920
phew so we shared so much over the past

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,160
few days

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,959
between our keynote our featured session

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,680
this morning

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,519
over 30 talks the folks from the github

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,040
stars team were able to reach out and

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
share some of their favorite moments

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,360
with me

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,279
we'll be posting that on social so you

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,880
can catch that later i absolutely loved

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
hearing from the millions of developers

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,839
who use github

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,079
every single day we want to beat the

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,320
best developer tool in the world so

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,320
keep telling us what you like and what

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,160
we can do better to make your workflow

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
better than today because the team here

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,880
at github loves hearing from our users

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,839
so with the featured session and the

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
developer track

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
and the enterprise channel and all of

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,279
that out of the way

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,440
did you take some time to check out the

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,440
university and play channels today

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,880
on the university channel michael and

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
lika talked about how

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,480
get mongodb and you can get started with

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,560
it right away

past few days

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,160
it has some of the most amazing beats

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,320
visuals and experimental code

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,480
that you'll find on the web trust me

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,680
elaine and her team did all of the hard

it out tomorrow

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
uh i guess bring your glow sticks and

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,519
your goggles

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
so speaking of tomorrow i wanted to

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,320
bring one of the speakers that you'll be

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,880
hearing from

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,640
my extremely talented co-worker who you

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,079
happen to already meet in the keynote

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,360
director of software engineering

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,600
nehabatra hey neha thank you so much for

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,800
joining me today

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,640
thank you so much for having me kyle so

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,240
we already saw you talking a bit about

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,160
discussions during the keynote and i

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,279
know a lot of open source repos

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,279
have actually already been using

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,399
discussions in the private beta what's

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,800
different about what you're going to be

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,639
showing tomorrow

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,240
so tomorrow what i'm going to be talking

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
about are some of the newest features

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,440
that we've enabled so

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
if you haven't seen it already i'll be

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,040
talking about things like customizing

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,399
categories to best suit your community

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,480
i'll talk about how you can recognize

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,000
your top contributors and discussions

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,920
and i'll talk about what you can do to

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
spruce up your repository with options

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
like spotlights

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,839
and finally i'll talk about what your

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
moderation options are within

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,600
discussions

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
that's some of the newer stuff that you

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,160
might see awesome and i'm curious

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,079
what would you say to the open source

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,079
maintainers and contributors out there

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,880
who are already using discussions why

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,040
should they tune in to your talk

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,720
yeah that's a really good question so

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,079
one of the reasons why i think even

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,839
people who have been using the private

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,600
beta might want to check out this talk

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
is that for every feature that i talk

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,560
about i'm going to be using examples of

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,000
how different people

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
and open source communities have

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,279
embraced that and i'll be showing those

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
kind of side by side

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,800
so for example if we talked about

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
customizing categories you might get to

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,360
see some of the categories that

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,240
different open source repositories have

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,800
been using

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,279
for their discussions so there is you're

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,480
going to see

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,320
new features you're going to see how to

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
do them and then simultaneously side by

00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
side

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
examples from all the different

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,920
repositories so if you

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,440
want to basically see those without

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,079
having to go to a bunch of different

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
ones on your

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
own um this would be a great talk to

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,079
check out

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,000
awesome so neha a little birdie told me

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,279
that today's your birthday and i know we

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,519
can't be together so

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,519
i got you a little something just so we

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,800
can pretend that you know

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,800
and i got you this uh i don't think i

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,279
can spend this through the camera
