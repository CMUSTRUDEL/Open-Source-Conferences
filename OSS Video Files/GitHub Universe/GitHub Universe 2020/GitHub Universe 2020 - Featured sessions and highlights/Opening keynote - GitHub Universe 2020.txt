good morning

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,519
welcome to github universe today we are

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,080
going to walk you through how we use

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,360
github at github and along the way show

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
you some of the really cool new features

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,039
we've been building

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,480
let's check it out i start my morning

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,800
with the github mobile app

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,640
i check out my notifications and i catch

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,359
up with my favorite communities

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,960
github discussions makes this so easy we

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,680
announced it a few months ago as a great

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,400
place for q

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
a and open-ended conversations and today

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,680
we're announcing that every open source

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,280
community can try get up discussions

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,040
with our new public data

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,440
just head to your repo settings and turn

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,600
it on right now

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,920
[Music]

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
we've learned a ton from the communities

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,879
that have already been using discussions

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
and we've added some great new features

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,120
like customizable categories

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,970
and native support in our mobile apps

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320
it's awesome

00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,399
[Music]

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,600
oh this is a really interesting idea

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,359
that came from the community i actually

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
think we should work on this

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:13,840
so i am just gonna at mention

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:13,840
ryan to see if he can figure it out

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,720
hey leo check this out that just pinged

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,080
us

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,840
huh that is a great idea let's open an

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,840
issue and get started

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
discussions is where your community has

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,680
open conversations or

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,600
ask questions or just hangs out the

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,840
issues is where you go to plan and track

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
the work that has to get done

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
maintainers always tell us that if

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
you're going to have a healthy project

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
it's crucial to separate the work that's

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,920
happening on that project

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,159
from your community's conversations

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,840
that's why we created github discussions

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,360
and github issues issues has all the

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,040
project management tools

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,119
like boards labels assignees

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,840
anything else you need to share plan and

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,840
prioritize across github

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,360
all right i need lupin neha she is the

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,040
animation expert on the team

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,239
let's not mention her and see if she can

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,800
help hope she's not too busy

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:36,050
all right leo gotta run text me if you

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:40,289
need anything

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,289
[Applause]

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,400
ryan all right i think ryan wants some

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,879
help coding up animation

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
let's take a look at the issue with the

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,519
new github cli

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
not only can i read issues from the

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,319
command line but i can also clone repos

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,400
and work with pull requests and more

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,800
it looks like we need to add p5.js to

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,879
animate some of our svg based octa-caps

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,840
but it isn't in our dependencies yet

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
let's add it real quick

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:15,009
[Music]

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,040
we're just getting started but i like to

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
open a pull request on my first commit

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:33,840
and mark it as drops so that the squad

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:33,840
knows that it's time to get in formation

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,400
[Music]

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,959
looking at the pr we can see that

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
there's some new dependencies to power

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,159
these animations

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,920
we should give them a once-over that's

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,439
super easy with our upcoming dependency

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,159
review tool that's built into pull

00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,920
requests

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,000
it automatically surfaces security

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,840
vulnerabilities and helpful information

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,480
about the added dependencies when you

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
preview the package json

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,840
i see we're pulling in a couple of

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
libraries that have vulnerabilities so

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,959
i'll need to update these to the patch

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,560
versions before we merge this p5.js is a

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
key dependency for animating these

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
octa-cats and we want it to be something

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
we can depend on for years to come

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,240
so why don't we invest in it yeah let's

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,840
look at the repo

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,300
uh yes we can fund them with github

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,080
sponsors

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,520
[Music]

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
i'm busy coding though so i'm going to

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,970
delegate this up let's ask nat to help

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
out with this

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:40,160
[Music]

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,400
and now a word about github sponsors

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,479
with github sponsors you can fund the

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,639
open source projects you depend on and

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,120
the developers you admire

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,280
github sponsors has already been a game

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,320
changer for developers including some

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,280
who've been able to

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,360
quit their jobs and go full time as

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,360
professional open source developers

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,840
they don't work for any single company

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,039
they work for the internet

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
now we want open source to thrive for

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,039
years to come

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,960
and given that every company in the

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,000
world now depends on open source

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,199
we know our community can do more so

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
starting today

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,960
companies can sponsor projects and

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,240
developers through their existing

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,560
billing relationship

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,560
with github so let's sponsor this

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
project

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:36,699
[Music]

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,639
leading companies from around the world

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
have already joined us in supporting

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,680
open source maintainers through github

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
sponsors

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
all right i'll let nejo know we've done

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,560
it and now

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,960
it's time for lunch now that we're

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,160
sponsoring p5.js i'm even more excited

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,280
to use it in our project

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,880
which means that this pr is ready to go

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,759
let's mark it as ready for review to

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
kick off the code review process

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,759
since we have a code owner's file in our

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,520
repo github automatically assigns and

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,000
notifies the team members to review the

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,600
changes

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,310
the team can leave comments and even

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,680
suggest changes for me

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,680
[Music]

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,600
and now for the coolest part manually

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,199
merging a pull request is nice and all

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,080
but how about we let the robots do the

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,960
work here

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,479
check out auto merge now when your

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,319
branch protection rules are met

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,240
your change is approved and your checks

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
are green github can automatically merge

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,000
your pull request for you just tell

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,400
github how you want to merge

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,039
with a commit rebase or squash and we'll

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,039
make it happen

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,319
i just need to rely on one more human

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,380
and that human is ryan where

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:54,470
is ryan anyway

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,470
[Music]

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
whoa it looks like nao cranked this out

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,160
already

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,720
let's check out the pull request give it

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,960
an approval so we can ship it

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
with github mobile not only do i get

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,039
push notifications for things like

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,080
comments but i can keep working on any

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,599
of my repositories no matter where i am

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,560
let's jump to nao's pull requests and

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,000
take a look with ui changes like this

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,840
sometimes it's hard to know if

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
everything's working just by looking at

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,280
the diff

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,360
sometimes i actually need to run the app

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,039
to see the changes

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,039
this calls for a code github codespaces

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,639
gives me a complete dev environment

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,880
right in my browser even on an ipad

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,680
it's like an infinite dev box configured

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
in code

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,000
just how you need it and since

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
codespaces is built on top of

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
visual studio code it gives us a fully

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
featured editor

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,919
right in my browser complete with

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,310
built-in terminal access

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,120
and shell access

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,960
[Music]

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400
while my application is running on a

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,639
container at github

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,490
i can securely connect to it right from

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:11,440
my browser

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:14,720
[Music]

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:27,840
whoa lowercase h

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:27,840
that's a bug let's fix it real quick

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,839
now i can just commit and push this

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,839
change right from my code space

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:56,580
[Music]

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
yeah i'm gonna snooze that notification

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,480
brian's got my back because he's doing

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,480
deploys today

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,800
notification

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,519
yo i love getting a good notification

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
when we're building software we turn to

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,959
github actions

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,480
as you can see we already have actions

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
up and running in our repo for pull

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,040
request

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,880
and codeql automatically looking for

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,640
security vulnerabilities

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,279
with our test all green i think it's

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,279
time to kick off this deployment

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,880
github actions is so much more than ci

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,680
it can react to any github event to

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,080
manually trigger

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,110
a deployment let's start by publishing a

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:54,080
new release

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,680
[Music]

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,839
as soon as our release is published our

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,279
deploy workflow is automatically trigger

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
so let's take a closer look at these two

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,839
new legit features starting with our new

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
workflow actions visualizer

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
this new ui is looking fresh you can see

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,480
exactly what's happening in your

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,560
workflow

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
how steps and jobs relate and even what

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,360
state they're in

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,040
for example here we're running the final

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,320
minification of bundling steps in

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
parallel while regenerating our

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,160
project's documentation

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,440
before we deploy out the staging now

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,040
we're ready to talk about the final

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
workflow step

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,560
also due to github actions is the

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,720
ability to require manual approvals for

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,560
action workflows

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,640
you can set protection rules and give

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
each environment dedicated secrets

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,600
that means you can make shipping

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
painless while also making sure

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,070
authorized team members can deploy to

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,440
production

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:45,360
[Music]

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,959

approve this deployment to go to our

00:10:48,480 --> 00:11:03,920
production environment

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,120
and with that our deployment is live

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,240
github actions are becoming more

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
powerful by the minute

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
and with over 6 000 open source actions

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,279
in the github marketplace

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,120
