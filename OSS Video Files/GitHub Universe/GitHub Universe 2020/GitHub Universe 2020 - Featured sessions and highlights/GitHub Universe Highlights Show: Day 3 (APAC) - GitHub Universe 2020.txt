00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,080
today i'll highlight some of my favorite

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,480
talks from the in performances from the

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,320
week

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,920
the best and funniest moments

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,520
of the last three days together it's

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,520
time to celebrate the end of github

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:30,320

i'll be your host kyle daigle and

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,440
hopefully you already knew that

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,600
it's the end of day three and i get the

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,520
distinct pleasure of sending you off

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,440
until we see you at get up satellite

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,320
early next year all right let's dive

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,239
into today

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
and then we can get to the after party

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,600
all right in today's

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,120
feature session principal engineer from

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
google and of course from kubernetes

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,360
fame

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
kelsey hightower joined us to share a

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,199
bit about his journey

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,320
to becoming the person you know him now

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,159
in the open source community

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,040
started for me around the age of 15. and

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,119
there's a long trajectory between those

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,799
humble beginnings

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,200
to the person you speak in front of you

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,640
today or commit to your open source or

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,640
your favorite open source project

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,240
now kelsey's talk was about kubernetes

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,799
get ops and the humans that glue it all

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
together

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,080
and he started by sharing a great story

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,840
about marathon runners

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,920
and how we can learn from how they can

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,759
work together in order for us to succeed

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
if you want to understand get ops you

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,720
got to understand the why

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
why are you using it what's important

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,640
about it what's the peloton formation

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,840
you're trying to build around you

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,640
and is it designed to help you go faster

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,520
are you just doing stuff because people

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,520
said it on twitter

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,439
i love that quote and in some ways this

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
technology isn't as new

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,759
which kelsey explained he talks about

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,880
how behind every process improvement

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,960
change that we make

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,320
or software products that we write it's

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,920
really the humans that make it all work

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,440
it's the humans that should be front and

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,280
center

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,560
today we'll be talking about kubernetes

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,959
and get ops and

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,879
the thing that kind of depresses me a

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,959
little is that we tend to put all these

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,040
tools before the humans that use them

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
when you think about git it's one of the

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,239
world's best collaboration tools for

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,319
writing software

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,080
and github is where we all meet and

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
collaborate

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
but it's the people that make all of

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,080
this work

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,360
during his talk kelsey shared one of the

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,360
key tips that you can follow

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,800
to make github's work more easily

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
between your kubernetes setup

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
and by using github actions it's pretty

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
simple

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
keep your configuration repro separate

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,040
in

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,360
lean on github actions here take a look

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,120
keep your config repos separate so what

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
does that look like in the github world

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
well you probably know what this looks

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,599
like if i click over here to my github

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,440
tab

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,920
i just have another repository where i'm

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,800
storing all of my configs

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,040
and here i can have my same git flow i

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,360
can do pull requests i can review them

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,519
and all of my configs are just sitting

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,599
here underneath

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,120
this directory called kubernetes i can

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,720
have other deployment targets maybe

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,519
you're using a serverless platform like

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,959
cloud run

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,959
and in that case you may have another

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,840
directory of declarative configs that

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
you put there

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,720
but the goal is these are just all data

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,959
artifacts that can be consumed

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,480
by some other system that can actually

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
take your declarative thing

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,599
and make it work i'm going to be honest

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,519
this was

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,680
really a talk that you need to watch in

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
the end kelsey did an amazing job of

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,480
telling a story here

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,760
and you're really only getting a tiny

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,159
taste in the clips that we picked for

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
you

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,159
i highly recommend that you head on over

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,879
to githubuniverse.com tomorrow

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,640
and watch the entire thing the hosts and

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,680
i have been reading all of your tweets

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,200
discussion posts

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
and it's been so much fun interacting

00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
with you during github universe this

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
year

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
i'm really gonna miss our time together

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,799
let's dive in

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
lisa has a message for all of those yaml

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,799
haters out there

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,560
deal with it kelsey's apparent love for

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,200
yaml came through loud and clear

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,560
me i'm still on the fence but i'll deal

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,560
with it okay

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,239
now check out this beautiful

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
illustration by carlo

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,320
you can actually sponsor him on github

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,280
sponsors right now i'll tweet out his

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,199
handle after this

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,800
to make it a little bit easier it covers

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,000
all the highlights and announcements in

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,160
a beautiful visual

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,759
format from the day one keynote really

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
excellent work carlo

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
and finally we have this amazing image

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,080
from the us stream today

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,080
it was too good not to share our u.s

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,160
enterprise hosts martin and dana needed

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,120
to kick it into business overdrive

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,440
and not only did both people wear suits

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
but martin was sporting some very classy

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,800
yellow hair

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,720
to match dana never change you two

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
thanks again to everyone for sending in

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
your tweets and engaging with us and get

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,680
up discussions

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,600
it was so much fun chatting with you now

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,320
let's move on to the rest of this

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,280
jam-packed day three by talking about

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
our talks

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
let's kick off our review of today's

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,919
sessions by looking at project scara

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,720
openjdk is an enormous open source

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,160
project that

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
recently made its migration over to

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,240
github along the way the team learned

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,240
some of the best ways to ensure that

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,720
maintainers focus their code review

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,919
only on the areas that they know best we

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
implemented

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,120
automatic labeling of pull requests with

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,720
the help of a github application

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,720
this means that for example let's say

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
you make a pull request and you change

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,680
one of the make files

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,440
used for building opendk our program

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,039
will then automatically look at the

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,840
files in the pull request that you

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,160
changed

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,080
realize your only change to make files

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
and then automatically apply the build

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,280
label

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,800
if you're considering migrating your

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,199
large project to github whether that's

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
an

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,199
open source project or otherwise there

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
were some great hard-earned tips in that

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,000
talk

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
be sure to check out the replay changing

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
gears a bit

00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,919
as part of the open source community we

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,440
tend to focus on the coding

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,120
the building of the software on each of

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,240
the projects during a panel on

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
maintaining boundaries

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,759
balance and funding in open source west

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,520
mckinney shared how important

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,960
non-code contributions can be

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,039
one of the things that i spend the most

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,639
time doing as a contributor and a

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,639
maintainer is is

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,680
you know gardening the issue tracker so

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,240
organizing

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,840
the reports that come in getting more

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,039
information from the from the issue

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
reporters

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,080
closing out duplicates connecting issues

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,680
together

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
setting their metadata because

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
ultimately a project that is that is

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,280
well organized and and where

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,039
we have as much information as possible

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,319
about the the bug reports of the future

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,919
requests that come in

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
is going to make it that much easier for

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,120
people to jump in and make

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,280
uh and make contributions you can find

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
areas to jump into open source right now

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,319
and chip in with issue assistance by

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
checking out github explorer

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,919
or during the holiday season projects

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,479
like 24 pull requests where you could

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,280
find additional opportunities to chip in

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,639
it's been a huge year here at github and

here's our tldr talked about juggling

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,960
work and play how automation makes

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,120
things better

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,520
working better together and securing our

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,520
systems

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,680

yesterday we got a sneak peek from neha

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,160
about today's talk on how to customize

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,880
github discussions for your developer

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
community

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,400
here she is talking about how some of

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,360
her favorite organizations

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,199
are using github discussions so here's

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,160
an example here where snowpack

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,360
has uh used the a pin discussion as

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,960
their change log

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,560
and so it's kind of pinned at the top

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,280
you can see that fred's got some spot-on

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,199
gifs here

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,960
and what i love is that each comma is a

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,479
new version and a details and it allows

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,800
people to easily reply

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,479
with thoughts or words of thank or

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
encouragement

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,840
check out the rest of neha's favorite

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,039

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,000
github universe.com and finally has your

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
mono repo evolve past the point

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,240
that you can handle it derek from the

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,759
github team has a few ideas for you

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
if this sounds familiar it's as your

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,759
repository evolves

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,199
that it grows and continues growing at a

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,560
faster and faster rate

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,599
as your team grows go catch them all

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,960
monorepo tips that is by watching all of

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,440

you know kyle this is my first year at

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,000
github and watching universe so close

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,360
it's difficult like everything was so so

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,839
special for me

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,959
but if i have to pick favorites i would

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,519
say uh

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,360
i would pick code spaces i love and in

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
my opinion i think it's gonna be a game

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
changer

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,240
it would revisionize like the whole

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,040
inner developer loop experience for

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,920
everyone

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,399
and being close to students i feel again

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,440
in these changing times remote learning

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,320
no labs low-end devices it's gonna be a

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,680
play game changer i also wanna add like

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,800
the play channel

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,160
um i'm not a very music person but

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,160
it got introduced like a new genre and a

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,959
new way of coding and and fun

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,279
possibilities uh for me yeah so it was

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,639
it was so so awesome

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
i completely agree about the play

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,360

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,880
and guests

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,399
moving their heads in between the

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,560
for you do you have a favorite moment

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,720
from github universe

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,399
oh so many favorite moments but you

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
called one out already you know i love

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,800
my twitter i love my community

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,360
so the things i really loved about

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,839
universe there was a talk on our channel

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
about building your community on github

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,200
which just like

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
touches my heart so much i absolutely

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
loved it

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,320
and then from the broader community

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,200
again the hashtag github universe was

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,680
just going

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,639
off i just love the way everyone was

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,760
sending in all their

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,079
photos their favorite moments showing us

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,639
how

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,000
they experience github universe in this

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,720
virtual era it's just

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,160
it's so exciting it makes you feel like

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,760
i mean it's not the same as being there

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,000
in person but makes me feel like i'm

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,600
able to experience it with everyone else

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,160
and yeah that's just definitely my

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,199
favorite part of this whole thing

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,279
and in quran you were with mish i hear

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,760
you used to do a bit of improv and i

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,880
imagine that came in handy while hosting

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,040
github universe

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,160
so tell me what were some of your

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,160
favorite moments from the week

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,320
absolutely kyle i think it's really

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,880
difficult to pick a favorite moment

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,959
because

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,079
it's been such an amazing get up

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,440
universe this time

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,760
hosting this with the amazing mish

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,519
out here but one thing that i really

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,920
really loved about github universe this

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,560
time

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,680
is how we are able to engage with the

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,560
apac community

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
in their own time zone talk to them uh

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,199
see

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,600
what's happening and hear to them on

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,440
twitter discussions and everywhere else

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
so that is one of my favorite part of

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,680
how we are able to come together

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,120
globally live and then tune in to github

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,760
universe this time

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,600
absolutely stoked that uh all of these

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,639
sessions and the community

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,639
