[Music]

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,160
we've learned a ton from the communities

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,520
that have already been using discussions

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,200

[Music]

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,319
that was a little bit of a bigger view

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
in the keynotes showing you how mobile

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,160

issues for planning your tracking in

and native support within our mobile

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,800
apps

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,959
github's upcoming dependency review tool

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,319
is going to give you a clear view of the

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,840
security vulnerabilities

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,000
you're bringing in with all of those

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
dependencies and what's a better way to

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,519
support the creators and maintainers of

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,959
those open source dependencies

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,519
then by supporting them github answers

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,440
github sponsors has paid millions of

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,680
dollars directly to developers

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,519
for their open source work but today

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
we're going full business and upping the

help organizations

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,200
join in supporting the open source

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,720
ecosystem and helping keeping it strong

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,480

joining us in this launch

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
to support our open source community now

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,239
if you've ever wanted to code while

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,080
you're

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,440
about or maybe on that underpowered

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
computer when you're visiting a family

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,159

we have a solution for you too no more

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,640
with messy onboarding you get a complete

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,599
developer environment with just a few

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,000
clicks with github code spaces

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,799
getup codespaces gives me a complete dev

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,400
environment

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,640
right in my browser even on an ipad

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,440
it's like an infinite dev box configured

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
in code

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,319
just how you need it and alongside

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,200
github's mobile app available for ios

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
and android

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,040
you have a complete developer

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
environment best developer tools in the

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
world on your phone

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,959
or tablet just a couple of taps away and

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
on top of all these features we have a

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,239
bunch of new workflow improvements that

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
are going to speed up your time to

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,920
production while also making sure you

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
have all the checks and balances

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,000
your process needs now when your branch

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,840
protection rules are met

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
your change is approved and your checks

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,359
are green github can automatically merge

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
your pull request for you

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,560
just tell github how you want to merge

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,840
with a commit

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,720
rebase or squash and we'll make it

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,240
happen

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,160
also due to github actions is the

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,400
ability to require manual approvals for

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,240
action workplace

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,320
you can set protection rules and give

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
each environment dedicated secrets

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,280
that means you can make shipping

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
painless while also making sure

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,240
authorized team members can deploy to

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,560
production

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,320
these new improvements are so good at

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
github were able to use auto merge to

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,840
get pull requests into their action

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,720
workflows faster than ever for some

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,400
projects

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
and for parts of the app that need a

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,759
little bit more review manual

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
approvals allow us to check our test

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,880
deployments before letting our

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
continuous deployment workflows

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,440
take over for us github actions is now a

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,440
full-featured ci and cd platform

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,199
ready for you to use i can't wait to get

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,039
these features into your hands

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,520
because sometimes it's the little things

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,680
that make the biggest difference

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
and finally if you use github on

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
premises

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,840
we're bringing all these amazing

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,880

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,160
first of all meet bruno a cat programmer

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,919
who seems to really be enjoying

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,759
or maybe is utterly confused by the

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,039
playtrack performance i'm not sure

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
i love seeing where you all were

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,840
watching from home today and bruno

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,280
please stick around for day two moving

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,039
on

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,280
brady was a little confused by his big

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,720
excitement for get up dark mode listen

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,240
i think i could hear all of you from my

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
house and this room is pretty sound

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,639
proofed

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,720
i assume you explained to them the utter

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,599
importance of dark mode brady

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,479
and finally sunny caught a line from nat

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
in the keynote

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,759
about how github sponsors can let open

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,919
source developers

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
work for the internet we already have

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,240
many developers on github sponsors

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,680
making

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,319
six figures full time which is awesome

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
and maybe not quite a cat and mouse duo

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,599
but now we have

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,560
boris watching github universe from

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,639
miles's house

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
and i've taken a liking to martin and

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,319
dana boris should meet bruno

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
mona feels like we have a whole

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,840
programming cartoon on our hands

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
share what you're thinking what was your

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,800
favorite part of universe use the github

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,360
universe hashtag

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,039
i'd love to feature you in the show

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,599
moving on we also had

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,319
17 talks today covering the gamut of

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,879
topics for

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,800
more info on github code spaces an easy

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,759
and powerful way to do development from

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
a web browser

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
to how you can do secure development

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,080
whether you're working on github.com

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,919
or prize i wanted to share a few of my

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,080
favorite moments from the talks but

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,639
you can see talks on replay by going to

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,800
githubuniverse.com

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,560
as you saw in the keynote code spaces is

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
the best way to both edit

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,800
and run your code with the power of vs

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,519
code right inside your browser

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,080
earlier today bailey matthew and allison

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,240
shared how

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,279
you can start writing new code run your

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
tests run your

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,640
actual application and then deploy to

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,640
production from almost any browser

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,800
legal and compliance risks for using a

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,760
dependency in a way that's not in line

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,480
with the specified license maintenance

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,320
risks

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,160
if a dependency is no longer supported

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,200
and you don't have a viable alternative

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,160
and other risks as well personally i'm

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,000
looking forward to

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,160
not fumbling around when i set up a new

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,760
code base i'm really excited to be able

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,920
to use my laptop or

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,920
an ipad to develop while linked to a vm

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,839
in the cloud be sure to check out both

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,040
the replays from both the code spaces

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,200
talks to learn more

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,040
or just go and sign up today you can

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,080
find the link at github.comcodespaces or

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,480
just head on over to github.com okay

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,560
now we have a new feature that is very

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
important related to security

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,399
now what is one thing that basically

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,480
every new feature has it's code

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,440
and what does almost every piece of code

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
eventually have

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,600
security vulnerabilities during today's

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,040
talks a bunch of our speakers shared how

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,120
github their companies

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,120
and many open source communities are

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,519
trying to make it easier to write secure

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
code

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,839
much much earlier in the process here's

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,839
maya sharing how github can help make it

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,200
even easier and so putting it all

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,640
together that means that instead of

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
having to identify

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,480
examine triage the vulnerabilities

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,839
independencies yourself

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,200
with these features with dependency

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
graph dependable alerts and the pen

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,399
about security updates enabled

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,200
managing a new vulnerability is as

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,600
simple as merging prs from depenebot

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,320
if we haven't convinced you yet security

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,519
is a

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,800
more than just something you need to

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,560
worry about it's something that you need

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
to consider from the very beginning of

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,240
your development project

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,240
and keith from thermo fisher scientific

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,600
thinks you need to treat security as an

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,880
actual feature

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,399
uh in a lot of ways i like to say this

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,079
is kind of like the faucet that you go

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,600
to or the sink that you may go to

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,360
and when you turn that left knob you

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,120
expect the water to be hot that's

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
universally true you didn't have to ask

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
anyone for it and you didn't have to

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
tell the plumber to install it that way

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,760
it's just the way that it operates and

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,279
so in a lot that's the way that people

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,279
think of security today is

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,200
those utilities that you just expect it

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,399
to be there and expect it to work

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,760
as intended now maya william shared how

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,480
we can keep vulnerabilities out of our

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
code and

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,160
keith talked about the importance of

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,240
security as a feature what happens when

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,680
you know you leak a production secret

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
into the code base

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,519
look don't judge me you've done it i've

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
definitely done it but

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,360
luckily for us sasha shares how github

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
code scanning

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,399
protects us getting into this big mess

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,000
at all

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,399
well if you as a user check in your code

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,120
and that code actually

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
contains the secret so we actually run

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,399
different regular

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
expressions from known secret scanning

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
partners

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,560
to identify if something you committed

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,959
actually

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,040
matches one of these secrets you're not

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,760
mining any bitcoin on my dime i'll tell

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,680
you that

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
all the many tokens i've pushed up have

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,720
already been revoked by github and its

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
partners

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,959
thanks to computers being both wonderful

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,040
and completely and utterly terrible

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,560
spencer from the metasploit project

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,480
spoke about how to write an

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,240
exploit module and then check it against

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
targets for vulnerabilities here's

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,279
spencer describing why he finds working

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,079
on metasploit

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,839
so interesting um i mean i i talked a

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
lot about like writing the exploits and

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,839
that's

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,839
that's really where it's at i always

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,399
find that incredibly exciting because

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,600
you're

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,200
you're tinkering with things and it's

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,480
oftentimes you know a puzzle where

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,720
you're trying to

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
create content to leverage uh

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,079
functionality or

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
a feature or a bug in a way that wasn't

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,519
originally intended

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,279
uh to be leveraged there's oftentimes

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,880
very very challenging and very

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,399
satisfying in order to be able to solve

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,079
that problem

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,920
special thank you to spencer and the

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,320
metasploit team for building

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,240
such a powerful tool github's been

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
working hard to bring you more features

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,160
that keep your code secure before

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,720
it gets into production and during their

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,720
talks today baz zevier and justin shared

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,920
how we're helping developers use github

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,600
advanced security

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
and baz and zevia shared how the

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,399
community is using code ql

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,200
to find more novel vulnerabilities than

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,040
ever before

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,519
to learn more about codeq well head on

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,279
over to securitylab.github.com

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,120
and be sure to check out the full talks

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,399
from today and dive into how you can use

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,560
codeql yourself

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,480
to find all the vulnerabilities that you

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,040
can think of in your own code and of

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,000
course

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,600
check out github.com security to learn

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
more about all the ways github

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,839
can help you with secure development and

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,079
finally if you're a github enterprise

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,839
customer there are amazing features

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,920
workflow improvements and security

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
automation coming to you in our next

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,160
release

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,480
here's one of the many demos from this

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,959
talk showing off the new private pages

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,920
feature

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,760
to make inner sourcing even easier this

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,880
is a company wiki built on

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,000
private pages private pages

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
again is another new feature which is in

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
beta now

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,279
and which is going to launch for

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,279
everybody before the end of the year

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,200
and what it means is that you can create

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,240
pages just as you know and love them

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,399
with get

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,920
which are only accessible by people in

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,600
your enterprise

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
there's more where that came from though

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
just to name a few we've got github

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,560
actions on premises automated code and

secret scanning alerts

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,240
conditional access policies to better

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,839
lock down your environment and extended

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,959
branch protection rules that are

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,880
environment aware

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,560
there's much for me to cover here you

how

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,040
everything you think you know about tech

such a busy day so i

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,480
worked together a bit on paying down

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,720
some of github's technical debt

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,759
over this summer alongside so much of

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
you

how we coordinated the efforts of dozens

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,480
of engineering teams and hundreds of

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,600
engineers to pay down technical debt

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,920
here at github

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,680
that we were able to significantly

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,240
invest in the state of our software

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,880
and our systems and making it faster and

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,920
easier

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,199
to build and ship github and even i was

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,160
in the middle of it right well it

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,959
happened and

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,079
i love seeing what we put in place to

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,000
