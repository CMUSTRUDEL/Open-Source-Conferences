today i'll highlight some of my favorite

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,960
talks from the in performances from the

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,799
week

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
the best and funniest moments

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
of the last three days together it's

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
time to celebrate the end of github

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:30,240

i'll be your host kyle daigle and

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,280
hopefully you already knew that

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,520
it's the end of day three and i get the

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,440
distinct pleasure of sending you off

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,360
until we see you at get up satellite

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,239
early next year all right let's dive

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
into today

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,360
and then we can get to the after party

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,520
all right in today's

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,039
feature session principal engineer from

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,440
google and of course from kubernetes

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,280
fame

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,559
kelsey hightower joined us to share a

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,039
bit about his journey

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,920
to becoming the person you know him now

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,760
in the open source community

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,640
started for me around the age of 15. and

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,640
there's a long trajectory between those

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
humble beginnings

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,799
to the person you speak in front of you

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,159
today or commit to your open source or

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,159
your favorite open source project

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,080
now kelsey's talk was about kubernetes

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,720
get ops and the humans that glue it all

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,720
together

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,000
and he started by sharing a great story

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,759
about marathon runners

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
and how we can learn from how they can

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,720
work together in order for

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,439
us to succeed if you want to understand

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,280
get ops

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,280
you got to understand the why why are

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
you using it what's important about it

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
what's the peloton formation you're

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,759
trying to build around you

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,560
and is it designed to help you go faster

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,439
are you just doing stuff because people

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,439
said it on twitter

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
i love that quote and in some ways this

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
technology isn't as new

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
which kelsey explained he talks about

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,799
how behind every process improvement

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
change that we make

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,240
or software products that we write it's

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,840
really the humans that make it all work

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
it's the humans that should be front and

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
center

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,480
today we'll be talking about kubernetes

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
and get ops and

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,160
the thing that kind of depresses me a

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,200
little is that we tend to put

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,800
all these tools before the humans that

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,959
use them

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
when you think about git it's one of the

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,160
world's best collaboration tools for

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
writing software

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000
and github is where we all meet and

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
collaborate

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but it's the people that make all of

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
this work

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
during his talk kelsey shared one of the

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
key tips that you can follow

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,720
to make github's work more easily

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,280
between your kubernetes setup

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
and by using github actions it's pretty

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,720
simple

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,120
keep your configuration repro separate

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,200
and

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,200
lean on github actions here take a look

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,480
keep your config repos separate so what

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,080
does that look like in the github world

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,319
well you probably know what this looks

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,879
like if i click over here to my github

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
tab

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,200
i just have another repository where i'm

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
storing all of my configs

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,400
and here i can have my same git flow i

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
can do pull requests i can review them

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,879
and all of my configs are just sitting

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,959
here underneath

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,480
this directory called kubernetes i can

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,080
have other deployment targets maybe

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,879
you're using a serverless platform like

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,319
cloudrun

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,319
and in that case you may have another

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,120
directory of declarative configs that

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,680
you put there

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,080
but the goal is these are just all data

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,319
artifacts that can be consumed

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,840
by some other system that can actually

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,640
take your declarative thing

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,640
and make it work

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
i'm going to be honest this was really a

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,680
talk that you need to watch

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,879
in the end kelsey did an amazing job of

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,480
telling a story here

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,840
and you're really only getting a tiny

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,159
taste in the clips that we picked for

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
you

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,159
i highly recommend that you head on over

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,879
to githubuniverse.com tomorrow

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,640
and watch the entire thing the hosts and

00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,680
i have been reading all of your tweets

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
discussion posts

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
and it's been so much fun interacting

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
with you during github universe this

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
year

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,239
i'm really gonna miss our time together

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,799
let's dive in

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
lisa has a message for all of those yaml

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,799
haters out there

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,560
deal with it kelsey's apparent love for

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,199
yaml came through loud and clear

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,560
me i'm still on the fence but i'll deal

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
with it okay

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,240
now check out this beautiful

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,400
illustration by carlo

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,320
you can actually sponsor him on github

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
sponsors right now i'll tweet out his

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,199
handle after this

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,800
to make it a little bit easier it covers

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
all the highlights and announcements in

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,759
a beautiful visual format from the day

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,720
one keynote

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,960
really excellent work carlo and finally

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,759
we have this amazing image from the us

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
stream today

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,080
it was too good not to share our u.s

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
enterprise hosts martin and dana needed

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,120
to kick it into business overdrive

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,440
and not only did both people wear suits

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,440
but martin was sporting some very classy

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,680
yellow hair to match dana

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,440
never change youtube thanks again to

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,520
everyone for sending in your tweets and

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,680
engaging with us and get up discussions

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
it was so much fun chatting with you now

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,320
let's move on to the rest of this

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
jam-packed day three by talking about

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,800
our talks

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,600
let's kick off our review of today's

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,919
sessions by looking at project scara

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,919
openjdk is an enormous open source

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,800
project that recently made its migration

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
over to github

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,880
along the way the team learned some of

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,240
the best ways to ensure that maintainers

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
focus their code review

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,960
only on the areas that they know best

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,960
to enable this we implemented automatic

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,520
labeling of pull requests

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,120
with the help of a github application

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
this means that for example let's say

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
you make a

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,360
pull request and you change one of the

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,600
make files used for building opendk

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,199
our program will then automatically look

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
at the files in the pull request that

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
you changed

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,840
realize your only change to make files

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,360
and then automatically apply the build

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,199
label

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
if you're considering migrating your

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
large project to github whether that's

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,199
an

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,120
open source project or otherwise there

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
were some great hard-earned tips in that

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,919
talk

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,720
be sure to check out the replay changing

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,400
gears a bit

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
as part of the open source community we

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,360
tend to focus on the coding

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,039
the building of the software on each of

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,880
the projects during a panel on

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,080
maintaining boundaries balance and

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,680
funding and open source

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,280
west mckinney shared how important

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,720
non-code contributions can be

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,960
uh one of the things that i spend the

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,840
most time doing as a contributor and a

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,400
maintainer is

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,680
is you know gardening the issue tracker

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,160
so organizing

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,840
the reports that come in getting more

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
information from the from the issue

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
reporters

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,000
closing out duplicates connecting issues

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,600
together

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,440
setting their metadata because

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,440
ultimately a project that is that is

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
well organized and and where

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,960
we have as much information as possible

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,319
about the the bug reports of the future

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,919
requests that come in

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
is going to make it that much easier for

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,199
people to jump in and make

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
uh and make contributions

community

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,560

are using github discussions so here's

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,560
an example here where snowpack

has used the a pin discussion as their

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
change log

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,720

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
a new version and it details and it

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960

hosts of the developer and

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,519
enterprise channels and i thought it'd

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,519
be only fair if we brought them here to

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,880

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,040
around a little bit longer and having

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,079
some fun with me while we put the

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,720
finishing touches

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,480
on github universe 2020. so listen i sat

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,200
down i calculated it out and

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,760
you have all been on camera for over 15

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
hours

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,680
in total and you've listened to so many

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,760
talks in questions

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,360
kath i want to start with you first what

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,760
was your favorite moment from this

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,480
github universe

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,200
yeah my favorite moment you know i just

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,440
i loved

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,959
today but i loved every single day my

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
favorite moment there's not just one

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,680
it's interacting with the community

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,279
on twitter on discussions and hearing

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,399
all of these talks and everything

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,399
but you know there's something that

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,200
takes the cake and i think it actually

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,399
was

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,720
b dougie's joke about letting the docs

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,639
out

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,560
because my dogs were actually barking

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,920
during my talk today

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
and that definitely i think that

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,959
deserves like a that's an oscar

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,279
moment for sure

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,279
b dougie uh on to you your setup looks

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,000
amazing and i think a lot of people took

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,920
notice

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,839
while going through all the tweets

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
directed at you between the pizza

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,680
beyonce

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
jordan and your setup photos everyone

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,880
was really loving it aside from the

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,720
excellent talk you did

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,600
uh did you have any favorite moments

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,920
from this year's github universe

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,279
yeah honestly this was quite unique

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,720
because normally i go to universe and

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
it's all based in san francisco and i

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,160
get to go talk to talk to talk

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,079
but he was online and i really

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,920
appreciated the keynotes uh not only

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,000
because i was in the first one but uh

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
also like erica's keynote as well as uh

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
kelsey's keynote

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,240
uh it was just really packed with a lot

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,680
of information and i think github sort

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,600
of just knocked it out of the park with

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
the type of content that

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,120
i don't know if everybody was expecting

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,160
uh all the hard-hitting facts and

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,720
numbers and

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,279
relationships to be built but um yeah i

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
mean

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,040
i just come away with like awesome job

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,279
selecting keynotes and getting these

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,279

being hosts for a virtual conference

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,160
dana i'm curious

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,160
what was different for you about this

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,800
time hosting

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,279
from intuit about how they championed

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,839
intersourcing and such an amazing

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,279
company

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,360
you know they started as a grassroots

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,959
effort it was just so inspiring you know

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
anybody can do this

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,720
and and they were proof to that right

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,720
there

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
and martin you're no stranger to these

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,560
events either giving talks

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,720
i see all the raspberry pies behind you

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,800
i think tell me from your perspective

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
uh going through all of the content over

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,519
the three days

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,959
uh what does github universe mean for

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,959
all the developers sitting at home

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,600
gosh it's uh it's late you know it's

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,760
been is like why is it

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,120
9 29 for me or something like that we've

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
been on air for 15 now straight you hit

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,360
me with a deep question like that

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,160
i don't know um i hope what developers

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
you know

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,440
like the open source maintainers you

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,480
just showed like gina hoisier and wes

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,320
mckinney and

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
but also developers in companies large

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,839
and small i hope

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,639
what you can take away from this week is

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,199
um the team here at guild the people too

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,800
and they've really got you know they've

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,959
really got people's backs you know they

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,519
really try to look after the developers

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,399
and

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,959
of us all i think i'm probably i am the

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,320
newest

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,240
like github here and um what i found

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,440
at github is that github's a company

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,880
that's really run

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,000
by developers for developers for makers

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,240
for creators

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
for the love of building cool things and

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
uh we just want to make tools that get

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,560
out of your ways

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,240
get help you solve problems and we want

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,600
to work with the whole community to give

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,959
you the building blocks to assemble your

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
best ways of working

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,600

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,199
