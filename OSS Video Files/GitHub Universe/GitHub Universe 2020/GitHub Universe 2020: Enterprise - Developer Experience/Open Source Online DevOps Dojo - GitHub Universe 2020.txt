Description: 
	Presented by Chris Swan,. CTO Modern Apps & Cloud Native, DXC Technology

This talk will take you through the version control module of DXC's recently open-sourced online DevOps Dojo. The journey will begin by explaining the need for version control and getting the environment set up by connecting to GitHub. We'll show you how to make changes to code, and run through to a pull request that's then edited to account for (bot-based) peer review before being merged in preparation for the next steps.
