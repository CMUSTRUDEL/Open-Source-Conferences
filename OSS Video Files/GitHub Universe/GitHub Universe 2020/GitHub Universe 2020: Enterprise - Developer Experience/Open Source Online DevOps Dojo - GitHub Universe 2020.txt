Title: Open Source Online DevOps Dojo - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Enterprise - Developer Experience
Description: 
	Presented by Chris Swan,. CTO Modern Apps & Cloud Native, DXC Technology

This talk will take you through the version control module of DXC's recently open-sourced online DevOps Dojo. The journey will begin by explaining the need for version control and getting the environment set up by connecting to GitHub. We'll show you how to make changes to code, and run through to a pull request that's then edited to account for (bot-based) peer review before being merged in preparation for the next steps.

[Music]

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,039
hi there so thanks for that uh very kind

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,520
intro

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
uh it touched upon dxe which is a

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,480
company that

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
some people have heard of but uh not

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,240
everybody uh so

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,439
i thought i'd start out by just briefly

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,279
introducing the company

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,279
to give you an idea of the things that

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,280
we do which will set the scene for

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,440
what we've been doing in terms of this

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,320
devops dojo

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,600
so at dxe we run the mission critical i

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,559
t systems

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,440
for thousands of companies across the

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,160
planet

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,719
and we talk about ourselves as a full

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,600
stack

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,079
services company so that's represented

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,239
here

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,120
uh and so on the right-hand face it's

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,280
showing the

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
types of services that we do so it

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,359
outsourcing

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,280
modern workplace uh cloud and security

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,199
applications and then finally analytics

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
and engineering and then on the left

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,439
face

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,880
uh it's going through all of the

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,880
industries that we serve

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,400
and there's uh really too many for me to

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,080
spend time running through

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,360
uh right now but you can see there's a

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,400
whole range of industries there

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,240
just to kind of call out some of the

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,920
things about scale the uh

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,600
number of employees that we've got

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,600
worldwide is uh over 138 000

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,799
and in our delivery organization which

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
was the target for

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
a lot of this devops dojo training that

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
we've been developing

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
uh that's uh over a hundred thousand uh

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,400
employees

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,560
and then looking at the applications

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,320
area that i now focus on

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,439
65 000 application professionals

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,960
so we've got a lot of people to do up

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,280
skilling with

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
and that's become a huge challenge for

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,719
us so i want to briefly

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,159
talk through the history of the dojo and

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,719
we started out in 2016

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,560
with an infrastructure as code workshop

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,000
so this was something that was

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,840
based in our enterprise github and

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
it was just three modules so we were

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,879
getting people through doing

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,440
their first pull request using github

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,440
they were doing their first playbook on

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
a config management tool

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
and building their first ci and cd

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,800
pipelines

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,480
using jenkins and i had a team of people

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
going all over the planet delivering

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
these workshops they would typically

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,519
take

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,360
about half a day and it was designed to

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,959
be viral as well so that people who'd

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
taken the workshop could uh

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,000
go back and teach another one with their

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
colleagues

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
and at the end of the year we'd had

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,160
something north of a thousand people

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,080
uh had gone through that workshop which

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,680
you know in one way was great but if we

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
looked at the overall size of the

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,440
challenge kind of getting

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
uh tens of thousands of people hundreds

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,599
of thousands of people through the

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,640
workshop

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,640
uh it was a little bit

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,360
too much it was going to take too many

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,800
lifetimes for us to get there

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,080
so in 2017 we took that infrastructure

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,120
as code workshop

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
and turned it into our first online

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,040
devops dojo

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
so we built this on top of a platform

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,360
called catacoda

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,519
uh it was right at the start of 2017 uh

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,360
i was at the monkey grower event run by

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,319
the the red monk analysts

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,959
and uh bumped into luke marston there

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,720
who was

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,599
at weave works at the time and he showed

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,640
me the samples and examples and demos

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,120
that he'd built

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,879
uh to show off what weaveworks was doing

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
uh using catacoda

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,840
and i kind of saw that and thought wow

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
this is going to be the thing that will

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,080
let me take this workshop

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,040
and make it web scale so we took the

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
workshop

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,480
and put it onto catacoda and that then

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,599
allowed us to

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:58,799
address what's subsequently become

00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:02,159
28 000 people across the organization

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,159
then 2018 uh an inner source team had

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,640
started to form around this

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760
uh and they had lots of plans about more

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
advanced topics

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,239
uh to address and so uh from the white

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,760
belt we grew the the yellow belt and

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,000
there were so many modules

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,000
that the team wanted to build we split

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
it down into different stripes

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
so on our internal learning management

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
system there's a yellow belt stripe one

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,320
a yellow belt stripe two

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
then later on uh they also had some

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,759
ideas about doing different types of

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
dojo so we've built

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
things like the product management dojo

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
which is intended to

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,720
help people who've traditionally been in

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,479
project management roles

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
think about the difference of doing

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,120
product management

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,639
and then uh we'd always plan to do this

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
and we finally got there this year we've

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,199
taken some of the modules out of yellow

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
belt

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
and turned those into our open source

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,199
online devops dojo

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,840
and that's one of the modules i'm going

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,840
to be walking through today

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,320
so you might be wondering where can i

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,320
find the dojo and i'll post these links

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,759
uh into the discussions uh as soon as

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,680
i'm done with this

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
but the easiest way is simply to search

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,800
for dxe online devops dojo that should

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,400
turn up at least one of these links and

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,919
so i'm going to be diving into the home

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,800
page in just a moment

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,880
which is there on github pages and you

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
can see also links there to the source

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
code that's uh

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,120
running on the cadacoda platform uh and

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,800
then the source for the github pages uh

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,759
presenting the the environment that

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,759
we've wrapped around that

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,240
when you get there uh you're gonna see a

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,199
webpage that looks something like this

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,720
uh and so it's uh introducing the the

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,160
storyline behind

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,240
uh the dojo so we do a lot of stuff with

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,919
continuous delivery pipelines and those

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,039
pipelines need to be built around

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,199
applications

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,199
uh and so for that we've used the spring

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,000
pet clinic application

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,759
because it gives us a sort of flexible

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,680
and well-battled tested

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,360
sample app that we can do interesting

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,319
things with

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,880
but to complement that we've built a

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,600
cast of characters and a storyline

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,520
uh about the the pet clinic and the

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,680
people that are working there

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,960
and you can see here uh we've got a cast

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,880
of characters that's

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,680
inspired by gene kim's phoenix project

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,479
and unicorn project uh with uh charlie

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,199
the ceo

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,720
john the coach paulo the product manager

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,160
brenda the business

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
uh hal the hacker uh serena the security

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,600
officer

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,160
and adam the system administrator etc

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,560
and

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,479
that list of characters carries on and

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,440
then finally

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,759
we get to the modules themselves so it

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,319
begins with a story in setup

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,520
and that is all about getting the pet

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,800
clinic app into

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,400
your own uh github user

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,479
so that you can start doing things with

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,720
it and also setting up the bot

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,160
that's going to be used as part of the

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
version control module

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
so i'm now going to jump into a screen

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,880
share and get to the version control

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,280
module

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
itself

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,880
and so i'm going to launch

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,199
get the version control module and

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,520
that tab is now going to take me into

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,440
the catacoda platform

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,599
and all of the catacota modules begin

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,919
with a splash screen like this

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,000
you can see that the estimated time for

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,680
running this module is 30 minutes

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,280
as i glance at the clock i've only got

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,880
about 13 minutes left

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,720
for my slot so this is going to be a bit

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,160
of a speed run

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,800
so i'm going to hit the start scenario

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,280
button here and that's taking me into

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,160
the cadacoda platform and what you can

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,120
see is

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
on the left hand side i've got a

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,080
storyline which is telling me what's

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,919
going on

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,160
and then on the right hand side i've got

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,120
a shell where i can actually run

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,599
commands

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
and one of the things that's useful here

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,879
is

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,039
this is a real live container based

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,680
environment so people can come here

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,520
and ski off piste from the modules and

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,120
try things out in the safety of the

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
training environment

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,319
should they want to do that i'm going to

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,800
stick for the script

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,160
for the time being and so i hear the

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
scripts explaining

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
uh the sort of scene set on why uh some

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,960
changes need to be made and why

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,319
git is being used uh to track them and

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
github is being used for the

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,800
collaboration around that

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,360
uh and so it's telling me that the

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,440
team's choosing a branching model

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,120
and if i press continue it's going to

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,039
take me then into

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,039
the section of the storyline where i can

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,440
start actually interacting

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,279
with the environment so we begin with

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,320
this preparation script

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,159
and that takes me uh

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
into a place where it's asking for me to

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,640
paste in a github token

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,480
i've just added a minus s there so i can

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,360
paste that in without it being echoed to

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,519
the screen

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,279
uh because we don't want the the github

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,839
personal access token to be

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,440
shared during a demo uh but normally

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,959
it would be probably not too much for a

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
problem for that to be echoed on the

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
screen there

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
you can see as well that my editor at

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,360
the top of the screen

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,600
has sprung to life here as the pet

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
clinic repo has been copied into place

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,080
and i'm going to be using that in just a

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,200
moment to make some changes to the

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
pet clinic application

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,959
so we're now getting into the user story

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
and it's starting to give me some steps

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
uh and that user story

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,640
is uh in github issues so we could go

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,080
and take a look at that

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,800
but following the steps that are being

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,399
outlined here we begin by getting into

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,480
that pet clinic repo

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,640
and i could type that out manually but

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,920
caracoda gives me the lazy option of

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,279
just clicking on the button

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,959
and that's going to run the command

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,279
there for me

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,279
and then i can do the same uh to check

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,680
out a branch which i'm gonna call us

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,600
horse one

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,200
and it's now time to make some changes

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,839
so it's telling me to navigate

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,040
into this uh source main

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,680
resources database

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,519
hsql and the data sql

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:19,839
and i then need to go to line 23

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,839
and add an extra line so let's do that

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,800
so i've added the text for horse and

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,760
i've put the different index there for

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,200
it

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,240
and that's all set to go

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,760
so if i now run git branch

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,480
i can see that i'm on the us1 horse

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,320
branch and if i run git status i can see

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,160
that i've modified the file so there's a

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,600
live update happening from that

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:50,880
editor above the terminal so

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,160
the changes is made but uh i now need to

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,680
add it commit it

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
uh and push it so the usual uh procedure

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
here

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,079
i'll do a git add i can then do git

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,160
status again and see

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,600
that uh i've got the modified turned

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,760
green

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
i'm now going to do a git commit uh

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,120
adding a comment that

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,800
i've added support for horses in the

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,160
database

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,880
so that's happened and then finally

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,519
i'm going to do a push and that's going

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,920
to then

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,760
get it up into github where i can switch

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,320
over and start doing some collaboration

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
around that

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,160
so this is a really basic introduction

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,079
but kind of takes us past what we were

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,399
originally doing in white belt

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,360
because at this stage we're now getting

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,160
into more of a collaborative interaction

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,839
with the bot rather than people just

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,959
merging their own pull requests which is

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,920
what we'd originally done

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,519
so now i'm at the stage to do a pull

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,079
request

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,160
and it's telling me to go into github

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,279
and into my pet clinic repo

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,399
well i left that open earlier on uh and

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,800
i can see that it's all

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,079
automatically picked up uh that i've

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,160
just pushed a change

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,920
uh so let's take that into a pull

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,440
request

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,839
i'm just going to accept the defaults

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
here and create that pull request

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,920
and sort of normal stuff happening here

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,519
in terms of uh merge ability

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,120
but i'm not going to just click merge

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,399
there because the

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,760
storyline has us going somewhere else

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,639
so we're simulating peer review here uh

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
with the bolt

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,639
and so what i need to do is uh ask paulo

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
the product manager

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,839
uh if he can do that peer review so

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,020
let's take that

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,440
uh and paste it in

00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,920
[Music]

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,920
and i didn't get the copy there

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:53,839
try again

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:21,839
[Music]

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:21,839
all right let's just do the manual way

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,079
okay so paulo's uh come straight back to

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,519
me and said that uh

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,519
it's all looking good on the horse but

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
they want to add pony to it as well

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,720
so i need to go make some more changes

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,480
uh and so let's jump back into

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,480
the editor here and i can make that

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
change

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,720
right so that's the changes made and

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,519
as before we can do get status

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,360
now we can add the file uh do a commit

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,360
saying that we're taking pollo's

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,560
comments into account and then push that

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,440
back up and let's ask paulo

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,000
uh if he's uh good with the uh the pony

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,839
being

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,839
added so that's already been pushed and

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
let's see if that does it for us

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,600
and i might not have quite got the

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:58,079
language right there so i need to say

00:14:43,600 --> 00:15:00,480
can you check now

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,839
and he's done the looks good to me and

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,600
is saying that he's merging the pull

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,800
request and we can see that the bot has

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
taken care of that merge

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,560
so that takes us pretty much to the end

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,600
of

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,760
the interactive parts of the module

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,160
we kind of close out here by saying that

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,920
the the user story is ongoing

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,639
uh and there's more still to be done

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,000
with the underlying issues

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,240
if i glance at my third screen i can see

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
emails popping in about that merge has

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,880
already taken place

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,720
uh and i could continue now and it's

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,480
giving me the congratulations splash

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,360
screen and inviting me to

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,560
uh carry on uh with dojo so at this

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,560
stage i'm going to go back to my slides

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,560
and jump out of the screen share

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,399
[Music]

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,120
now one of the things that happens quite

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,320
frequently

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,920
is people run into trouble as they're

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,600
going through the modules and

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,120
you know that can be problems with the

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,519
underlying platform

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,759
uh it can be issues with just their

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,240
browser or something like that

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
and it can sometimes be especially with

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,680
jenkins

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,880
uh issues around uh plugins having

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,519
drifted away from

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,160
uh behavior that we're expecting so

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
we've got

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,199
the get help button that people can use

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,519
and when they press that that's taking

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,440
them into github issues

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,160
where we've got as you can see a

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,680
pre-populated form

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,480
that's allowing people to tell us about

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,000
what they see going wrong uh how we can

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,360
reproduce that

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,040
and what they're expecting to be

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,240
different and maybe even add in

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,480
some screenshots so

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,600
uh anybody trying this out if you have

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,959
any problems with it

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,160
then please feel free to raise an issue

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,279
the uh original inner source team uh

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
that developed this

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,880
uh internally uh is kind of now on the

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,199
hook for

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,880
uh answering these issues uh and dealing

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,639
with the the pull requests

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,400
uh which they're sort of log accustomed

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,480
to now because that's the exact same

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,480
process that we've been using

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,480
for the internal dojo modules

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,959
so i kind of close out now with

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,400
our call to action um and you know it's

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,559
really three parts

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,799
uh the first part of the call to action

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,600
is please try the dojo

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,200
um you know it's been open sourced so

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,240
that it's there for

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,679
uh everybody in the community to use we

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,240
did that because we thought it was

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,280
something that was going to be useful to

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,960
our customers and our partners

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,880
but more broadly to the devops community

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,600
so please tell other people if you like

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,640
it and if you find problems then please

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,400
raise an issue

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,919
with us uh if you don't like it you know

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,799
tell us what uh could be made better

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,120
the second part of the call to action uh

00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,919
is

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,840
uh to please contribute uh so we're

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,360
happy to take pull requests

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,039
uh this is one of the things that's

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
really helped us uh polish up the

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,400
modules

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,440
uh as we've been using the platform

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,919
internally

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,320
uh is people spot things that uh you

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,440
know they'd like to improve uh and they

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,080
let us know about it

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,039
uh through the medium of uh pull request

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
and

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,440
uh some folk sort of early on in our

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,400
journey

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,919
were coming along to the dojo um and

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
yeah often they've been pushed by the

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,400
manager to do it

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,080
and you know thought that the whole

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,760
thing was uh a waste of their time and

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,320
as soon as they got involved with it

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,320
they're kind of okay i can see the point

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,200
of this now but i kind of hate these

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,520
bits or this

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,039
this thing could be made better and so

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,919
you know many of those people

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,240
uh contributed internally and uh you

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,640
know we did that through their pr's

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,640
but a lot of them also became part of

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,679
the inner source community that's helped

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,559
us

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,840
make this better and broadened out the

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,840
range of modules

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,679
that we had then finally

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,120
if you think something like this is

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,679
going to be useful to you

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,080
but you want it to be different then

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,080
feel free to fork it

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
we chose the mozilla public license

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,320
version 2

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,160
because we didn't want a

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,400
super liberal license that was going to

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,960
allow the the content that we've got

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,039
here to be

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
just taken by our competitors and

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,160
blatantly ripped off

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,160
so we just wanted uh a license that

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,360
made sure that dxe had some kind of

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,559
acknowledgement

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,080
uh for originally creating these but we

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,799
really do hope that it's useful

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,919
uh to other organizations um and you

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,640
know they can potentially

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,120
build that around uh their own tool

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,080
chains

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,240
so yeah we've originally done this with

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,080
our enterprise github and some of our

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,240
practices around that

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,000
and our own use of jenkins and some of

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,760
the associated tools

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,760
but you know we're moving some of our

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,280
own stuff to github actions and making

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,600
changes there and we understand that

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,360
other

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,960
orgs have kind of different approaches

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,400
to doing stuff

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,799
and so part of what uh we we kind of

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,440
expect people to doing with folks

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
is adapting uh to the different tool

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,760
chains that

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,159
they prefer within those organizations

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,679
all right then well thank you very much

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,679
