In this talk, Rok Novosel and Hamel Husain will present CodeSnippetSearch, a web application extension that allows you to search GitHub repositories using natural language queries and code itself. It uses PyTorch to power deep neural networks which embed natural language queries and code snippets into vectors. Using nearest neighbor search, it can determine which code snippets are most similar to a given query or another code snippet. What's more, a tool like CodeSnippetSearch can allow you to easily explore unfamiliar code focusing on the semantics without getting bogged down in the syntax, which is especially useful when onboarding a new developer onto a project.
