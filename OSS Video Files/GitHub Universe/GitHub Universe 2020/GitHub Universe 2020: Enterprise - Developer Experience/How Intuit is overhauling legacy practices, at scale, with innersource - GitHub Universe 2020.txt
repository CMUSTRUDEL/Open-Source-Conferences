Description: 
	Presented by:
Aliza Carpio, Principal Tech Evangelist, Intuit
Rocio Montes, Staff Software Engineer, Intuit

For large enterprise companies with thousands of engineers across the globe, shifting to an innersource mindset and culture can be a formidable challenge. Such was the case for Intuit in early 2018 when the company set out on its innersource journey. At the time, its engineering teams were using different structures for their repositories, different best-practices for documentation, and different workflows for code reviews. Today, the company is well on its way to company-wide adoption of innersource, with more than half of its repositories open for contribution, and a goal to open them all. In this talk, Intuit will share a model that enterprise companies can use to teach global engineering teams to work as an innersource community. With easier ways to add features, manage dependancies, and build new skills, you'll come away with the knowledge your team needs to build better software faster.

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,039
thank you

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,920
so much for that amazing introduction

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
welcome to our talk titled how intuit is

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,359
overhauling legacy

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,039
engineering practices at scale with

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,119
inner source

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,720
my name is elisa carpio and i'm

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,279
principal tech evangelist

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,239
at it focused on tech culture and i'm

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,800
joined by my colleague

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,800
rocio montes staff software engineer

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,559
leader in inner source and open source i

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,280
create tooling and animation to make

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,600
these two initiatives successful

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,559
thanks rocio let's just just jump right

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,000
in i'm not going to say

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,840
let's jump into it but let's go ahead

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,280
and jump right in now

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,079
what if engineers worked as a community

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,320
as code stewards and not code owners

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,280
mark earls the author of the book titled

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,840
heard

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,600
cited a study in new york between two

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,479
high school students two high school

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,479
schools

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,240
that are close in proximity to each

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,080
other but also have similar

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,600
socioeconomic conditions

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,439
the thing that's different about them

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
though is that the test scores between

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,040
the two schools

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
were so different especially in math one

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
of the schools had

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,360
really high test scores and so they

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,439
looked into why

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,040
and what they found was the school with

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,360
the higher math test scores

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,960
they found that the students worked on

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
homework together and studied

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,400
for their tests together they created a

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,200
community

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
where each member was both teacher and

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
student

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
and where each felt supported and worked

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
towards a common goal

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,960
so if you think about this and we take

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,000
the same principle

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,079
of working and learning as a community

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,320
we know that that can be applied to

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,840
midsize and enterprise companies in the

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
tech industry

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
today the pressure to deliver high

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,159
benefit

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,560
high quality solutions with speed has

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
led

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
many product development teams and i

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,119
know you probably are agreeing with me

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,399
to focus on the short term with each

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,520
engineering team

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,640
delivering just their own feature

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,280
but what if we can imagine a world where

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,480
we work

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,720
as engineers in communities of practice

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
have almost no meetings and are code

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,680
stewards

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
we would probably hear something like

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,440
this

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,280
on my first day i was up and running and

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,120
ready to code before lunch

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,879
each team really understands the

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,120
customer that they're solving for and

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,360
the problem

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
our team gets to own our own mission

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
make decisions

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,080
and solve for that customer we get to

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,720
see the difference that we make and i

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,000
know i can make that big impact

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,280
and so that feels really great

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
but is this nirvana just the stuff of

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
legends

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
and although i can't see you maybe you

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,239
can do me a favor and raise your hand

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,159
if that community of practice that world

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,680
that i painted is true for your

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,000
organization

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,200
if it is man we'd love to connect with

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,760
you and learn from you

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,480
now we do want to reach that nirvana and

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,040
we are

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,640
at into it in a journey to get there but

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,239
today to get there

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,800
does have some challenges um at intuit

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,959
we have six big groups across multiple

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,440
continents and multiple time zones

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
engineers and other technologists focus

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,599
on delivering solutions

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,519
declared as priorities by their groups

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,080
we have aggressive schedules

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
to deliver features fixes and products

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,040
to millions of customers

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,360
and speed yes it's a necessity but man

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
to get there there are some challenges

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,640
so i'm gonna name

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,440
four of them right now let me just build

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,599
this

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,760
um so the first is um in order to for us

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,599
to enable work effectively

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,000
right now we are still in this journey

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
to move from where code is owned by

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
teams and

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,159
and individuals to um to

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,439
to more and we'll talk more about the

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,680
solution but today

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,480
so many of our so much of our code is

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,120
still owned by india

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,680
and so there's a heavy reliance on these

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
folks

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,840
to actually you know do everything from

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,040
you know answer questions you may have

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,440
on that repo

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,280
to you know allowing um or to doing

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,199
reviews on your pr

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,800
now the waiting that is involved with

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,560
that especially when you have

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
you know um when you have disparate

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
locations across the globe

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
can get in the way of really being

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
speedy in terms of you know committing

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
your code

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,000
and that actually sometimes leads to

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,919
heroics for our engineers

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,840
now we also found that even though you

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,440
could tell me yeah my repo

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
yeah i've got it like you know

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,840
documented we have found that

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
the documentation lacked in so many of

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
them

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
and it made it really really hard to

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,759
contribute

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
and finally even though you may tell me

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,720
that you have

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,639
that you're adhering to standards we

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,120
found that standards actually

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
varied across the various um

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
organizations

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
and teams and so on boarding to a

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,400
project

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,759
or to that repo really was hard because

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,160
you had to keep learning

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,080
new rules if you will so how did we

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,720
solve it

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,759
we solved it by taking inspiration from

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,680
open source

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
and i'm going to hand this over to rocio

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,120
montes who's going to talk about

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,120
our solution rocio

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,680
thank you alisa so yes we implemented

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,880
a solution um that included an inner

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,400
source model

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,000
inner source takes the principles of

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,880
open source into the enterprise

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,880
environment

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
inner source it's a great tool to help

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,400
break silos

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
encourage internal collaboration

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,199
accelerate

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,360
new engineering onboarding and identify

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
opportunities to even contribute back to

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
open source

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,919
so let's talk about what our inner

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,680
source program included

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,199
when we first started to look at inner

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,039
source we discovered that

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,240
many business units and team were

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,479
already practicing

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
some form of inner source the logical

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,360
first step then

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,039
was to declare a set of unified

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,080
guidelines that outline

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,240
the one way that intuit engineers

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
could use to contribute to any

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
repositories

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,800
in our intuit ecosystem these unified

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,280
guidelines

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
included a document structure that every

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,400
repository

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,479
should have in order to be inner source

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
ready github will automatically

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,520
recognize these files

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
and enhance a collaboration experience

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,039
for engineers documents like code owners

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
to quickly get those prs a line assigned

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,960
to a code reviewer

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,039
a contributing.md to detail the rules of

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,360
engagement with each repository

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,479
and the pull request template that gives

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,919
every contributor

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,319
a checklist to complete before

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,080
submitting a pr this proven to be

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,919
really helpful in the contribution

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,319
process additionally

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,080
we required having continuous

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,880
integration and continuous deployment

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,520
automation

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,639
on each of the pr's completed with unit

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,039
and functional tests

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919
that it was definitely a must these pr

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,280
automations

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,160
gave contributors quick and useful

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,000
feedback

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,599
about the pr and the code that they are

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,360
trying to merge

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,160
on the next slides we're going to show

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,720
you that technology changes were not

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
enough

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,199
we actually needed to set up our teams

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,319
for success in this new world

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,960
so we actually needed to think that um

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,280
inner source is more of a mindset change

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,240
rather than a technological approach

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,720
um we needed our teams to understand

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
that

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,800
internal engineers were now a first

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,360
customer

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,720
and that would practice trial and error

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
there were going to be

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,919
that these frequent contributors that

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
were going to become

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,599
a trusted committer it's a new role for

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
us a role

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,479
with defined responsibilities to ease

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,759
and optimize contributions from frequent

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,560
teens

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,560
now please go back juana lisa

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,919
one more

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,840
uh one more sorry there we go

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,120
at the heart of inner source there are

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
the code reviews

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,800
we implemented training for new

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,599
engineers and existing engineers that

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
teach them

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,800
techniques to foster a healthy

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,720
contribution environment

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,319
when doing code reviews we actually

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,960
think that each pr

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
is an opportunity for mentorship it was

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
also

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520
very important to get teams to agree to

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,680
their slas for code reviews

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,639
release and support and of course

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,319
publish them in their contributing.md

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
on the next slide we're also going to

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,519
talk about how

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
we had to scale our efforts via

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,479
influencers

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,680
when we first started the program it was

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,839
only elisa and i

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,719
so we really needed to scale the efforts

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,040
but finding

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
passionate volunteers engineers and

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,399
leaders that already had a passion for

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,120
in their source and were excited to see

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,000
the benefits

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,440
inside into open source supporters were

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,600
also great partners

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
when looking for repositories to get

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,880
inner source ready

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,480
we focus on prioritizing the

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,360
foundational capabilities

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
needed for intuits technology strategy

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
additionally

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,320
we look for services that were the most

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,640
common and already had a big number

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,080
of contributors so we prioritize these

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,560
repos and getting them

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,800
in your source ready of course we needed

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,080
to establish a rewards and recognition

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,080
program

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
we're going to talk about more on that

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,519
later but rewarding early adopters

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,120
was really important so have i sold you

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,080
on getting intersourced implemented in

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,000
your company

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,240
this would be the steps that you need to

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,279
take in order to do so

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,000
you will for sure need leader support

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,600
in order to provide you know time for

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,440
training of their engineers

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
time for their engineers to adopt

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,640
engineer guidelines and make the

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,640
technology changes

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,720
and like i mentioned before you need to

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,680
create a set of unified islands

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,600
also identified your model teams these

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,720
themes that are going to be

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,959
like i mentioned foundational

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
capabilities in each of the business

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,640
units that you have

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
conduct workshops to teach how to do in

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,279
your source we actually have workshops

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,760
at each

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,720
into its site and every chance we got

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,519
every conference

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,760
every event there we were inner source

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,959
rah rah so it's really important

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,200
that you teach what inner sources

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,079
on the next slide i want to remind you

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
that you actually

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,160
need a group of people with different

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,800
roles and skills

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,839
you need of course engineers and a

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,360
product manager

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,519
make sure that you have diversity under

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,600
volunteers from staff level

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
to early career team members and you

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,480
need to make sure that they actually can

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
tell a story

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
and can do it well you will need to

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,680
implement

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,440
dashboards and metrics in order to share

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,240
the progress and track the readiness of

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,640
the repos

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
as well as the ability to find those

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,560
most popular repos

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,920
and the foundational capabilities

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,240
tooling and rewards

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,000
proved to be very useful in getting

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,880
everyone excited about inner source for

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
example

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,120
we created the first time contributions

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,800
we recognize that all the benefits

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,640
when we talked about the benefits of

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,720
inner source we were only talking about

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,160
the benefits to the business right

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,399
um prioritization ease of um

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,519
releasing to our customers more quickly

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,600
more features

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
but when we wanted to focus on the

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,200
engineer the benefits were that they

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
were able to

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,800
collaborate in different teams and

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
collaborate in different

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
um programming languages that they

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,079
usually do

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,440
on their teams so the intuit first time

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,800
contribution site

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,560
on the previous slide um outlined

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,680
projects that were actively looking for

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,360
contributors these projects um signed up

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,720
to the site and said here are some of

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,360
the issues that we have

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,760
and they could be on jira or on github

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,079
and

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,160
they were good first issues that anybody

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,639
could jump on and solve them

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,680
we also added an inner source batch to

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,680
our intranet

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,200
for those who have onboarded to inner

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,079
source and were participating in the

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
program

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,880
um this is kind of like a bachelor now

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
back to alisa who will talk about the

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
engineering benefits that we saw with

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,639
the program

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
thanks for ceo now you heard about you

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,399
know the benefits

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
for at a high level for engineers we

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,519
also wanted to let you know that many

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,560
engineers told us

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,160
that by allowing us allowing engineers

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,600
to contribute to other repos

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,519
they were actually investing in their

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,720
craft and that they were learning new

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,639
skills

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,079
um and in addition to the engineers

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
there were other stakeholders that

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,440
really do benefit

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,800
the other one is our internal and

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,839
external um

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
customers and our customers definitely

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
said that wow

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,399
the the products not only are they

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,480
delightful but when there's a problem

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
you get that fix out right away

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,560
now for the business brazil did mention

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,079
the business earlier for the business

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,240
um not only was there speed and

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,120
delivering solutions and and products to

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
customers

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,120
but there was definitely higher

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,720
engagement from our engineers or from

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,800
product development teams

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,079
and we believe that that and we're

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,240
starting to see

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,120
you know some data on this but we

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,920
believe

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
that higher engagement leads to higher

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,399
higher retention

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,200
of top tech talent

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,480
and this is our final slide um we are

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,440
we'd love to share with you the

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
resources

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,880
that you know might also inspire you to

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,720
take on this model

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,560
or maybe enhance the model you currently

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,279
have on your inner source model in your

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,440
company

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,440
the first is the book that i mentioned

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,079
called heard by mark earls and this is

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,040
all about

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,600
how do you tap into the social nature of

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,160
beings

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,760
including human beings in order to

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,240
actually create a movement

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,959
in order to actually create change the

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,040
second is

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,079
inner source commons we took a lot of

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,480
inspiration

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,240
from the learnings and best practices

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
that they shared

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,680
we also wanted to make sure i know rocio

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,000
kind of touched on it

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,120
but fun has to be in a lot of the things

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
that you do i mean

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,639
rosia talked about how we went to

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,360
different sites and did the rah-rah

00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,760
but we have to infuse fun and we loved

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
how

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,440
when we looked at made with code they

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,199
had a section under community

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,959
and we love some of their ideas there

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,279
we've definitely adopted those

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,279
and finally this is all about change
