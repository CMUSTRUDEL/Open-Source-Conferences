For large enterprise companies with thousands of engineers across the globe, shifting to an innersource mindset and culture can be a formidable challenge. Such was the case for Intuit in early 2018 when the company set out on its innersource journey. At the time, its engineering teams were using different structures for their repositories, different best-practices for documentation, and different workflows for code reviews. Today, the company is well on its way to company-wide adoption of innersource, with more than half of its repositories open for contribution, and a goal to open them all. In this talk, Intuit will share a model that enterprise companies can use to teach global engineering teams to work as an innersource community. With easier ways to add features, manage dependancies, and build new skills, you'll come away with the knowledge your team needs to build better software faster.
