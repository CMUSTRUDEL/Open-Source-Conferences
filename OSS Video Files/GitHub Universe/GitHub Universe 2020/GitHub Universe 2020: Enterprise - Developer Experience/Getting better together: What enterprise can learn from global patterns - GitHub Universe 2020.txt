Title: Getting better together: What enterprise can learn from global patterns - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Enterprise - Developer Experience
Description: 
	Presented by Nicole Forsgren, VP Research & Strategy, GitHub

In 2020, we’ve had to rethink how to collaborate and build software in the world’s largest trial of remote work. As the year comes to a close, what lessons can we bring to our organizations to empower development teams and embrace the challenges set before us? And what does it all mean for the future? Dr. Nicole Forsgren will share insights on the findings from her past work and the 2020 State of the Octoverse report, including how open source is at the forefront of collaboration.

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
hi everyone

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,039
thanks for joining me i am here to talk

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,359
all about

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,480
really some of the latest research i

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,960
don't know if you've heard

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,840
i like research i like strategy i really

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,400
like data

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,480
why because it helps us get better so i

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,000
do research and strategy here at github

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,680
in a previous life

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,520
back in the day i was actually writing

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,800
mainframe programs so

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,640
it feels appropriate that i'm here

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,239
hanging on the enterprise channel that i

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,239
was a software developer i was an

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,480
engineer i was building systems i was

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,680
supporting them i was assist admin

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,920
and then i decided to go do some

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,680
research i was lead investigator on the

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
state of devops reports for years

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
or the accelerate some of you may have

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,879
heard of it

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
a lot of that work was based on helping

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,359
us understand

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,840
some of the core principles capabilities

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,840
practices and processes to help

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,880
companies of all sizes

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,080
understand how we can help build and

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,960
develop software

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,880
for high performance so that we can

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
really do things that are dope

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,840
so what have i been up to lately i just

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,040
joined github earlier this year

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,159
well we just released the state of

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
october's report

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,479
last week it was a birthday present to

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
myself and everyone else

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,600
we took a slightly different approach

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,680
this year so in addition to

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,200
sharing with the world how github has

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
grown and changed

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,560
we also did some deep dives so if you go

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,560
to the website

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,600
octoverse.github.com you'll see a little

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,320
button

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,040
that says download three reports now you

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,560
don't have to

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
i was also a professor so i'm not going

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,159
to assign some homework but you may find

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
them really interesting

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,680
because the site will walk you through

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,439
some of the highlights that

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,280
i love it will also share some of the

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,960
background some of the nuance

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
some of the detail or you can watch this

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,959
talk and i'll walk you through some of

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,840
my favorites

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:17,200
so let's dig into it we had quite a year

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,160
we have now grown to over 56

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,360
million total developers on github

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,560
that's some power

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,080
when we say community we say community

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,959
now we also see 72 percent of fortune 50

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,080
companies

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,280
are using github enterprise just

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,440
in the last year in the last 12 months

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,480
we see over 60 million repositories were

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,760
created

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,280
and 1.9 billion with a b

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
contributions were added in the last

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
year i mean

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,000
when i say we've had quite a year we had

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,920
quite a year

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,519
i don't know about you we've also had

00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,239
quite a year

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
we could take a moment we can feel that

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,720
right

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
and so when we were designing the

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,319
research and the research questions

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,640
that kind of guided our investigations

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
we wanted to see what this might look

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,280
like what we're feeling

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,720
what we're doing and how it shaped not

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,319
only

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,640
the activity that we see among

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,280
developers but how it might shape and

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,920
inform

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,680
our practices moving forward so this is

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,640
what we'll talk about today

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,400
juggling work and play how automation

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,959
makes things better

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
and the patterns that we see working

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
better together

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,920
and then we'll wrap up with securing our

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,760
systems

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,519
so let's jump in the wayback machine

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,519
because again this year feels like it's

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,760
a wayback machine

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,879
what we did is we took an investigation

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,040
across four

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,720
time zones to see if there are some

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,720
interesting patterns

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,920
these four time zones for development

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,599
activity include

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,159
the uk time zone u.s eastern time zone

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,120
u.s pacific time zone and japan standard

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,200
time zone

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,680
now we selected these because we have

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,519
some uh some strong data in these

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,280
so that they won't be overly influenced

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,560
by any you know

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,880
significant uh standout organizations

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,639
and these these time zones also had some

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,519
pretty strong shelter in place orders

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,880
now the one i'm displaying here is uk

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,240
time zone

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,000
there are a couple things to notice here

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,680
as you take a look at this chart

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
uh that line where everything's kind of

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,840
centered is our zero

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
so if we hadn't seen any changes in

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,199
activity

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
noticeably compared to the prior year

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
everything could kind of be hanging

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,240
along there

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,720
uh here's what we take a look at first

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
we worked longer take a look at those

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
purple bars

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,800
uh as we kind of chug along up until

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
shelter and place orders we see a strong

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
covet effect

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,680
as we compare the time difference

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,400
between our first

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,560
and last get push to the main branch in

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,520
any repository that we're working in

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
we see a strong increase right people

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,759
are working

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,440
longer hours now i will say a little bit

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,840
of this is expected right because

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,280
once people start working from home even

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,560
before covet

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,320
we tend to work a little bit longer

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
hours because we lose this boundary

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,880
between work and life

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
but we see this grows for a while until

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
maybe

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,720
people are getting used to it a little

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
bit right maybe we start adjusting maybe

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,280
we get a little bit better at creating

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,400
boundaries

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,560
maybe we create a commute right maybe we

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,280
take a lap around the block

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,000
to kind of separate work and home so

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000
then our next

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,199
question is well are we spreading out

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,479
work or are we actually doing more work

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,240
that's the green line you see is

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,080
is how much work are we doing for this

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,680
we proxied it with the number of pushes

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,160
that we're doing per day

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,720
per day so here we kind of see that kind

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,039
of jog along that zero line

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,479
until we initially see shelter and place

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,360
orders go into effect and

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,280
it kind of takes a dip as we're suddenly

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,800
adjusting to uncertainty and

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,840
change and so many things are happening

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,199
um kind of comes even and then it jumps

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,120
quite a bit so it's interesting because

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,680
overall and we see this fairly

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,160
consistently across the time zones

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,199
many people are both working longer

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,280
hours

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
and getting more done

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
wonder how we all feel about that i

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,479
don't know about you i feel it

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,080
so what else did we see though we saw

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,440
that people are really turning to open

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,919
source

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
we saw contributions to open source jump

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,199
initially

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
40 compared to last year and then when

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,840
they settle out they settle out at about

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,360
increase compared to the previous year

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
so as we're all sitting

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
home what are we gonna do we're gonna

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,960
pick up hobbies

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,039
some of us named the sourdough starter

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,039
some of us played video games some of us

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,400
tried to open source to learn

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,240
create turn to our community

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,919
it's kind of exciting because there's so

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,919
much for us to do but then

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,759
then we step back and we're like wait

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,160
there are only so many hours a day

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,520
how are we working more and on open

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,639
source more

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,199
so we took a look by day of the week

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,080
here's what we saw now we are working

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,680
more

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,160
these are kind of light out but laid out

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,400
by days of the week starting with monday

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,039
uh we're working as much on saturdays

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,720
and sundays as we are on mondays

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,319
take from that what you will but we're

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
working more on tuesdays

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,440
wednesdays thursdays fridays spend

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
development time

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,039
we step down that work on saturdays and

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
sundays and look what happens to open

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,919
source

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,599
so the bars are the are our work work

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,360
days work hours

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,199
open source kind of chugs along and it

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,840
jumps up on the weekends

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,599
we're creating time for open source this

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,199
is a great opportunity for us to

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,720
disconnect

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,639
uh reach out pair with our community

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
i think it's important for enterprises

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,919
and teams and managers and leaders to

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,960
realize

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,720
that open source is something else it's

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,199
something different

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,319
we should create space in our corporate

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,720
cultures

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,720
and our corporate policies to make sure

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
that we allow our developers this space

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:25,840
why because productivity is personal

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,520
right it does provide us this escape now

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,240
i've been chatting with researchers

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,880
conducting dozens of

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,560
experiments across and research across

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,360
many many other teams

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,479
and we do see that productivity is

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
personal

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,200
as we saw in the previous charts many

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,920
people are spreading out their days

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,720
flexibility is key here and one tip we

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,760
can say to

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
anyone here managers developers one of

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,519
the big tips

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,800
we see resonate with many many people is

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,760
that it's important to manage your

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,080
energy

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,160
not just manage your time some people

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,040
are finding great success by focusing in

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,800
the mornings

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,040
or by focusing late at night sometimes

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,560
people are finding great success from

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,760
finally having flexibility in the middle

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,399
of the day to

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,320
work out or take a nap or or kind of

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,839
have that flexibility

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,000
one of the great things that we also

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,760
find is that not only do we have a

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,040
little more flexibility

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,040
with our work times and our work

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,440
schedules now that we're home but by

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,800
having great flexible tools that allow

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,279
teams to collaborate across time zones

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,600
across

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,640
contexts and across geographies

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,839
leveraging things like

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,839
inner source can really help

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,080
because things like automation are

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,080
really enabling this

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,920
we did an additional analysis we found

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
that once an open source repo starts

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
using

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,320
actions on their pull requests we see an

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,519
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,480
faster time to merge that pull request

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,000
and an increase of 30 more pull requests

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
merged

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
now we chose pull request as kind of

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,480
that interesting perfect little

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,839
inflection point

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,920
because that means you can automate

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,120
notification of asking people to take a

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,800
look at that pr

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,120
or you can then kick off the rest of

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,240
your development workflow

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,279
so look at the impact of automating

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,800
just one aspect of your workflow

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,959
it helps reduce toil work

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,800
it helps reduce manual work the things

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,079
that are important to do

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,079
but we may not love doing it frees up

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,200
time to do the things that we love

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,120
it improves our developer experience it

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,480
kind of greases the wheels

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,480
for the rest of what's great

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,440
and i think that's also important to

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,279
realize is

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,200
this isn't just about productivity yes

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,880
we see amazing productivity gains and

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,600
that's important especially in a year

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,920
like this but

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,279
it's also about making tech sustainable

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,480
and if we think

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,079
back beyond march

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,560
march march so many marches this year um

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,959
devops was kind of the original hipster

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,920
for building

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,279
systems and making tech more sustainable

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,640
it was really about

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,560
improved technology an improved process

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,839
and better collaboration and better

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,399
communication

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,519
so that we could take care of ourselves

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,320
and we could take care of our teams

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,120
and while it's true in open source

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,240
there's nowhere that it's more true

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,120
than enterprise systems

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,200
so speaking of communication and

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,440
collaboration

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,120
we also saw this happen at scale

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
as we look again it's so interesting

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
right we see this covered effect

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
appear so many places as we kind of chug

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,680
along the air

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,560
by the way that that quick jump on the

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,000
left uh is thanksgiving holiday we saw

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
a shift in it across weeks uh but as we

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
take a look at

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,360
pr merge times once shelter in place

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
orders occur

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,120
across all open source repositories pr

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
merge times drop

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
which means they're getting faster and

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,240
they got up to seven and a half hours

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,120
faster

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,519
remember this is a sign of collaboration

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,240
people

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
are maybe they're home but but we had so

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
many things we could do from home we

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,079
were eager to reach out and work

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,200
together

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,560
and create and build wonderful things

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,600
but it wasn't just open source it was

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,519
also our our our

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,639
working together right in our enterprise

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,800
repositories

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,320
we saw this in enterprise we saw this in

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
paid team repos

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,760
we got up to five and a half hours

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,160
faster

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,079
we really were working together and

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,680
collaborating better and collaborating

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,920
faster

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,120
we really figured out how to get this

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
done

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,800
and i think it's exciting and and not

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,600
just

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,279
with prs not just core in the code but

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,079
talking about

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,279
all of the things that make our projects

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,279
and our community great

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,720
github released and announced

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,519
discussions

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,839
earlier this year so we took a look at

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,720
the next.js repository

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
and how they were using discussions and

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
it was

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,399
great to see and kind of exciting to see

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,560
how this grew over time

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,600
and what we found is that it really

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,720
helped

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,040
keep this community more resilient

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,639
and more sustainable what some of our

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,160
other analysis found is that some of the

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,240
best ways to invite

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,760
and encourage and foster newcomers to

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,399
stick with the community

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,880
are with issues the challenge with

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,120
issues

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,399
that can burn out maintainers so the

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,440
exciting thing is that we

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,040
also found that one of the best ways to

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,600
encourage newcomers

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,199
is with discussions discussions is a way

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
to engage

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,399
talk about what's happening learn new

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,079
norms

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,440
now some of you may be thinking well

00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,839
what does this have to do with me nicole

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,800
this is

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,680
enterprise track this is great because

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,600
as we think about

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,680
scaling our solutions and scaling

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,120
throughout our enterprises

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,519
think about things like centers of

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,279
excellence or communities of practice

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,639
this helps make sure that our expertise

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,519
isn't siloed

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,120
this helps us spread that excellence

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,880
it's a lot like inner source right we

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,000
have so many things we have

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,720
expertise we have process there's so

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
many things that we can share

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,279
now speaking of open source and building

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,880
and sharing that expertise we also

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,639
looked at

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,440
at how open source is used and across

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,199
all of the package ecosystems that

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,399
github supports

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,079
so many of them most of them over 90

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,880
rely on open source and i think that's

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,480
so exciting and so wonderful because

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,959
there is this amazing

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
amazing resource that's available to

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,760
almost everyone

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,519
right that's incredible we also then

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,519
took a look to say

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,040
uh to ask ourselves what does that mean

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,320
in terms of dependencies

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,320
right because we also need to be

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,760
thinking about security so what does

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
this mean in terms of our security

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,720
posture

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,320
what we found is that it's super

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,800
important to secure our code because

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,199
any piece of software can have hundreds

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,000
and thousands of dependencies

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,440
and this chart here shows you both

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,519
direct dependencies

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,160
if something that you directly pull in a

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,240
library or file has a dependency or if a

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,759
transitive dependency

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
or how many transit dependencies it has

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,560
so if anything you know in turn pulls

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,959
out a file

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
what we found is that any piece of code

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,399
or any repo has a

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,839
59 chance of getting a security alert in

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,079
the next year

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,000
uh for those active repositories with

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,040
supported package ecosystems

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,639
now in case you're saying wait this

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,160
means i can't use open source

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,399
that's actually not the case at all

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,399
because then our follow-on analysis

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,000
asked where do these vulnerabilities

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,800
come from

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
most vulnerabilities are mistakes only

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,759
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,199
of them are explicitly malicious things

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,279
like backdoor attacks

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,199
and they result in only 0.2 percent of

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,560
alerts in the in the very commonly

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,440
and most used repos um and and most use

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,399
files

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,480
83 of of these vulnerabilities are the

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,560
result of mistakes

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
so it's important to remember anyone

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,279
anyone can make a mistake and anyone can

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
insert

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,279
a mistake into your code base

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
so by leveraging the power of community

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,880
that means that

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,480
anyone in this community can help find

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,160
these vulnerabilities

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,920
and fix them for you you've suddenly got

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,160
a huge home team advantage

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,320
so what does this open source

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,519
vulnerability timeline look like

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,240
it actually takes over four years

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,839
uh often to find a vulnerability once

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,959
it's introduced

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,399
um this seems kind of long it's actually

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,160
not totally unheard of

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,759
uh the only analysis that we could see

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,799
that was similar to this was from an od

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,000
analysis which is

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,919
kind of like comparing apples and

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,919
oranges but ran ran this

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,839
analysis and it was about five five

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,000
years to identify vulnerability

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,959
but once that vulnerability is

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,439
identified

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,000
it takes uh the community just over four

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,679
weeks

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,319
almost four and a half weeks to fix the

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,000
vulnerability takes about 10 weeks to

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,959
identify the community and then one week

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,360
to fix

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,559
i will note that for people using github

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,200
advisory database

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
we can alert 20 times faster because we

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,160
don't need to run

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,720
through several steps of animated areas

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,720
and imports

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,919
now another benefit of automation

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,360
repositories that automatically

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,320
generated a pull request using

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,600
dependabot

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,960
to fix patch their software 1.4 times

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,640
faster

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,559
so many times people ask me what does

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,360
shift left look like if i want to be

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,000
doing devsecops what does that look like

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,960
this is what that looks like we can

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
scale

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,280
what it is that we find we can build

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,320
that into our development workflow

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,000
we have so many opportunities to to

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,120
build security in

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,480
so again we're leveraging

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,320
the wonderful things that the security

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,360
community finds for us

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,120
we can build in that patch automatically

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,039
and it just happens now

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,039
i'm about out of time so let me share

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,880
just a few more favorites that i had in

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,880
the findings

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,200
we did more work overall this year

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,720
so then we ran another analysis how did

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,080
we get more work done

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,760
were we just creating like giant files

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,720
turns out no pr size overall

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,799
didn't change this one made me

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,799
personally very happy

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,640
because much of my prior work shows that

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,880
some of the best ways to get work done

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,039
is to work in small batches so pro tip

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,080
keep working in small batches it makes

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,960
your releases

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,600
faster and more stable and it makes it

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
easier

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,160
to be running your pr's now

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,320
what else github is the home for

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,400
more than just developers in our

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,280
community report we ran an analysis that

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,559
went beyond

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,640
just one year in arrears we went back

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,960
seven years in some cases to see how our

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,600
community is changing and growing

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,039
and we found that while we are growing

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,799
overall and we still have many

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,240
developers

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,640
so many more people are joining the

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,160
community we see scientists we see

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,840
people in education

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,240
we see people in data like data analysts

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,720
there's

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,520
there's a space for so many people here

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,440
managers

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,520
leaders so many people are joining

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,160
github and github is a place

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,000
not just for code but it's a place for

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,039
so many different file types

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,840
the platform itself is maturing becoming

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,880
a place

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,840
for many different types of creation

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,679
we also found that the most critical

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,039
vulnerabilities are caught

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,480
in code review code review

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,559
not just for code and and linting in

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,679
tabs free spaces

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,159
it's also most importantly for security

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,000
and our security vulnerabilities

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,520
okay listen there's so much more there

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,760
go check out the report go check out the

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,679
site

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,600
octavers.github.com now

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,360
here's the slide take a picture you'll

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,799
get credit

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,720
even if i'm sure you've been tweeting at

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,480
your favorites here's

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,400
here's our tldr we talked about juggling

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,360
work and play how automation makes

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,520
things better

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,559
working better together and securing our

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,400
systems

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,400
