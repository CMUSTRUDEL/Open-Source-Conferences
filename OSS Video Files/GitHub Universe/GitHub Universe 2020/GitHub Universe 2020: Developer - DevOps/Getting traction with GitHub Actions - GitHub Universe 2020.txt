00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,240
speaker role today and i'll be giving a

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,759
talk about getting traction with github

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,000
actions which is one of my

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,439
favorite subjects but before i jump into

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,279
that i wanted to give a

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,039
pretty much a catch up of what i've been

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,039
i've been doing uh for the past

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,400
nine months and uh like so many other

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,800
people back in uh

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
uh this summer i watched this

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,679
documentary called the last dance and it

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
was all about michael jordan

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,160
um i i stand by this one quote which is

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,840
stan lee which is imagine every issue

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,000
is someone's first issue in the context

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,280
of comics stanley being the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,760
the founder of uh marvel comics and

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,640
uh i watched this this documentary

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,200
learned so much

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
about the the famed michael jordan the

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,039
superstar

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,480
uh if if you will and um i also realized

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,000
that you we have some gen z

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,239
uh watching this as well you might not

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
know michael jordan this is a conference

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
on five continents being streamed

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,640
uh but if i could just summarize michael

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
jordan he back in the the war of 1995

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
between the monstars he actually

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,119
single-handedly defeated

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,960
with a little help from bill murray uh

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,799
defeated the monstars uh and saved

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
toontown um but that's

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,320
really not what he did uh he was

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,119
actually a star baseball player um

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,560
for 13 months no i'm just kidding no

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,840
michael jordan he played baseball for a

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,880
short amount of time but he also did a

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,240
bunch of other stuff

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,159
uh if you look at the next slide he

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,640
hosted snl he was a big uh superstar

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,840
hosted us now uh he also

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
um was best man for bugs bunny and

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,200
lola bunny as well in the bottom right

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,560
you can see that the image there

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,880
um but he's done so much to be like like

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
get to his point of super uh fandom uh

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,320
in the keynote i actually had a

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,640
uh this shoe right here which is the

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,079
jordan three uh in my in the keynote

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,159
and uh this is a shoe that came out

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,520
more like 15 years ago actually i'm

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,439
doing my master wrong

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,880
more than 15 years ago but anyway these

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,399
are shoes that people still wear today

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,479
so his mark has been

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,600
basically pressed in the entire sports

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,439
arena but also

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,880
he sort of leveled up the game by

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,440
actually uh bringing

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
nike uh into the forefront and i bring

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
up michael jordan because he

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,480
is not only one of my favorite players

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
he's also a superstar

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,319
and as i mentioned before i think of

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,280
myself as the beyonce of github

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,200
uh uh i i stand by that i'm a beyonce

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
advocate uh not only i'm a beyonce

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,160
advocate i'm a developer advocate uh

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,440
these are all my handles

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000
everything else you need to know about

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,560
me is right here bwo on twitter b dougie

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,160
on github

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
uh definitely check out my myspace page

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,959
that i built over there and

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,160
i bring this up because i like to go to

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,840
go to bat for the hive

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,280
uh beyonce she goes about for the hive

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
as well she stands up with the the

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
lemonade uh

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
yeah y'all should watch that too as well

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,040
uh also watch that that um

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,599
the show on the z plus two as well that

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
was uh i mean that's pretty legit but

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,800
i digress i'm going to move on from

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
beyonce and talk about what i really

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,959
want to talk about which is github

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,400
actions

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,000
now github actions is a feature that

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
most people at this point

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
like if you if you watch the keynote if

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,480
you watch any videos if you leverage

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
github

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,680
in the last year you probably have seen

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,400
this uh first and foremost

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,000
and it's really a tool to take your

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,159
workflow to the next

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360
level so i mentioned like if you're into

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,280
devops which this

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
what the entire session today is about

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,239
is about devops like you could do that

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,080
with github actions

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,840
and i think what a lot of people kind of

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,959
think of github actions as

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
is ci and i even saw this in twitter

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,879
github universe uh check out the twitter

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,720
feed there someone brought up

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,239
uh with the continuous delivery features

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
like what what is what does that mean

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,840
for

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
containers integration i think they're

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
sort of conflicting everything into one

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,400
which is fine because that's what

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,840
github actions is uh and if you zoom

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,480
back a bit it's all about workflow

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
automation

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,080
automation that automating yourself to

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
get back to the code

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
and i bring this up because uh when

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,879
jason warner

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,560
stood on stage a couple years ago at

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,879
github universe he

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
he presented actions as a feature for

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,040
developers to get back to what they want

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
to do

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
so if you're constantly doing all this

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,959
um tedious checking in

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,720
like hitting up slack telling your your

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,480
co-workers to review your prs

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,920
like you could automate all that stuff

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,159
and the beauty of this is that

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,439
github actions basically gets you back

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,599
to what you want to do which is right

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,959
code

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,639
and i mentioned this and i mentioned my

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
example the pull request but

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,919
what you could do with actions is so

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,280
much beyond ci

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,199
because you can take those repetitive

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,160
tasks that you do all the time just to

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,919
get your workflow

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,280
you know up and running and moving along

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,240
chugging along and making sure you're

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,000
you know

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,000
killing in the sprints um

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,800
yeah i saw i messed up anyway uh

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,240
so i have an example and

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
my example and i wrote a blog post about

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,199
this actually so if you go to dev um

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,120
dev um dot two and find myself which is

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
b dougie on dev as i mentioned this

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
i use those handles everywhere um i

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
wrote up a blog post of how i do the

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,759
automation piece

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
of my workflow and the automation

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,120
workflow piece

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,639
is around my storybook so i have the

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
pleasure of actually following up

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,160
angie and learning about apple tools and

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
how you do in the end testing

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,759
uh and she had mentioned uh briefly

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,680
about checking your components

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
and one thing that i did with my sort of

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
uh refresh of my project this project

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,160
i'll show i'll talk about in the next

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
slide

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
um i read the whole read the design i

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,960
actually learned how to use

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
figma and sketch and all those other

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,120
things i'm not a designer by trade but

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,479
i can i wanted to basically build a new

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,199
design so i ended up leveraging

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
storybook

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
and the way i did this is every time i

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,080
made a change to any

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
component in my component folder

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,720
structure because i happen to be doing

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,400
react i wanted to update my design

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,479
system and my design system

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,400
is here and it's using storybook uh so

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,560
this is designed.opensource.pizza

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,320
and again i'm not a designer so please

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
don't critique my design here

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,000
uh but what i'm getting at is every time

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,080
i made a change to that

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,680
any components in my design structure i

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,520
actually have an action that triggers a

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
deployment and then triggers a

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,080
not only triggers uh deployment but also

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,800
it only watches that folder structure

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,639
um so again that is detailed on the blog

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,360
post i can't really spend much more time

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,520
on that

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
um but what i wanted this focus on is

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,240
the automation piece

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
i was able to not focus on how to get my

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,240
components updated just for storybook

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
uh if they don't uh if they don't change

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,120
the actual production site

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,720
um by just using github actions

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,319
uh one other thing that i also added to

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,120
in my my workflow

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
is adding lighthouse now uh jake jarvis

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,000
actually he has this lighthou

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,919
lighthouse action and the one thing that

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
i do for my deployments is i deployed to

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
nutify

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,080
uh and the reason why i chose this is

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,639
that every time there's a netify deploy

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,880
preview

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,600
uh on my project which is open source i

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,039
actually get an entire preview

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
directly linked inside of my pull

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,720
request which is beautiful

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,400
because i've been using this other

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,199
action i built called logify

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,479
which also brings my previews into the

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
deployment logs

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,160
first and foremost i don't have an

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,199
example about this in cd yet because it

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,880
again they just launched yesterday um

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,960
but what i like about this is that i get

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,000
lighthouse scores every time i open a pr

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,680
so if i have a pr

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,039
from someone else because this open

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,000
source project anybody else in the

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,759
community

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,440
i actually can find out if i've got like

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,280
a degradation of

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,800
my lighthouse score or performance or

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
accessibility right there

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,919
in line with the pr and when i talk

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
about sort of

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,680
identifying a repetitive task every time

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
i open up a pull request i want to make

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
sure accessibility and performance do

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,599
not go down i want them to stay

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,800
consistent or

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,080
get better so i bring that up because

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
with the lighthouse action i can

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
actually embed

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
those lighthouse scores within my action

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
logs so that way

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,520
not only in my actual logs but also in

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,360
the pr comments and it's all powered

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,880
from this one action which is

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,400
beautiful and like you're probably

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,440
thinking you know white house is already

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
embedded in chrome

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
like you can just open up the chrome tab

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,800
and like this know what you're doing and

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,800
check that before you merge the pr

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,160
and the thing is i won't do that i won't

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,599
do that for anybody's prs

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,280
i want this to be automated and get

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,639
myself back to writing my own code

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,319
and i have to do that for every time my

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,400
pr is open up on my project

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,160
so i bring this up uh shout out to the

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
artifacts too as well by actually having

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
the report

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
in line inside of my logs as well uh

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
it's just a beautiful experience

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,000
uh speaking of beautiful experience in

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,360
basketball which you know you didn't ask

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,479
about basketball but i'll continue down

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,360
this path

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,240
full court layups is a term that it was

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,599
very

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,919
like prevailing when i was in high

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,520
school uh playing basketball uh where

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,520
you have a with basketball there's a

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,800
it's a five on five team all right so

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
a lot of times there could be one

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,479
superstar kind of like a michael jordan

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,400
and they might just be more like a ball

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
hog which michael jordan by far is not

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,039
one

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
um well he doesn't play anymore so you

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,800
can't right hog anything but

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,919
what i'm getting at is this term of full

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,440
court layups is like you

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,760
one person would take the ball in check

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
it in and then they would drive the ball

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,599
all the way to the other end of the hoop

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
and

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,919
the best way i can explain this is nba

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,920
jam so nba jam is not real basketball

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
but it's basically that you just take it

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,080
in and you slam dunk at the other end

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,480
it's an amazing

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
game amazing sport definitely uh if you

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,920
want to go back to

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,720
the world of nostalgia play some nba jam

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,040
for sure

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
um but if i could better explain this as

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
well um

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,760
i do have a basketball court here so if

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
you are familiar with basketball

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,680
uh let me just break it down it's kind

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,920
of like soccer except you use your hands

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
um but you have a court you have two

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,560
hoops on each side

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,320
and the goal is basically get the ball

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
in the opponent's tube so this is what a

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,080
full court layup is

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,680
and i bring this up because there's a

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,560
thing that you can do which you can over

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,279
you can optimize uh to actually score

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,640
points

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,160
and i think this is really what it comes

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,800
down to when i talk about developer

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,200
automation

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,480
and uh hopefully this will hit home soon

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,519
but i read this book earlier this

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
actually last year

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,959
uh and it was all about hoopanomics and

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,399
moneyball and if you've never heard of

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,800
either there are definitely books out

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,080
there

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,320
i don't have time to really break down

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,959
that entire book but watch the brad pitt

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
movie

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,440
but they applied statistics directly to

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,600
the game of basketball so they found out

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,640
if you shoot the ball from this point

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,640
and on the court

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,480
you have a 31 chance of the ball going

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,760
in well if you know that then you can go

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
ahead and optimize

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,120
all your plays to basically drive to

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,959
that point of the court

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,800
so this is my five-person team of

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,480
basketball this is where

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,760
generally if i were running a play i

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,839
tell the team that basically these are

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,680
your points of the

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,040
the court to stand then uh so go there

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,399
and then that way people know where

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,959
you're at and then we can optimize to

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,160
get the ball

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,800
to where number two is at so i bring

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,720
this up

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,760
because in the documentary in the last

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
dance i learned something really

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,240
interesting which i wasn't even aware of

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,600
which is this thing called the the

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,720
triangle offense

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,440
so the triangle offense basically it it

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,880
breaks down

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,000
the the game in a way that you're always

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,000
going to have a triangle

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
uh so if i know if i'm standing in one

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
point to the left of me and to the right

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
of me there'll always be something

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,320
somebody there

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,880
and hopefully based on the game of the

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
chance

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,920
that's one of those people will be open

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,360
so then what i'm bringing this up

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,320
because a lot of people think of michael

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,279
jordan as like

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,240
a superstar and a person who like to

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,760
sort of transcend

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
the game and i think what really a lot

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,959
of people miss is the amount of effort

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,040
and practice he put into

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,160
uh he actually there's actually a book

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,040
called the power of habit

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,320
and understanding like the the habit of

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
if you know

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,920
every single situation if you want to

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,440
play towards area 31

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,279
you'll know that always look at that

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,640
point and when that point becomes open

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,600
that's when you take your shot or you

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,000
shoot your shot

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,920
um so i bring this up because i'm

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,880
talking about actions and get up action

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,959
attractions

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,399
and um i love when i talk about i get to

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,079
talk about like the github api and the

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,320
stuff that github's been working on

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,079
um as a beyonce advocate developer

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
advocate is that github is a bunch of

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,000
primitives that sort of

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,040
actions kind of combines and makes into

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
one nice

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,560
uh built feature um so some of the

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,160
parameters i

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,920
can uh that i leverage and like these

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,000
are sort of high level primitives but

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,480
probot and octokit so octokit being the

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
sdk for interacting with the api

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,440
uh this open source tool definitely

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
check it out if you've never heard of it

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
uh and then we have probot which is this

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
sort of sdk to build github

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
apps and what i love about this is when

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,600
i when i was building lots of github

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,240
apps a couple years ago

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,120
is that my zero to have something in

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,600
production

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,200
the time it took was pretty low because

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,639
all i had to know is what web hook i

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
need to interact with so

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,560
in this example i'm actually checking

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,120
out the web book for issues

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,399
and what i'm getting at is that i know

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,279
there's going to be interaction that i'm

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,519
going to have

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,480
like whether it's reviewing pull request

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,720
once a day

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,079
or if it's every time an issue is open

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,920
like check those

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,000
and i have even a better example coming

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,200
up which is github script so get up

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,639
script is a combination

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,720
of octa kit and pro combined into

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,000
actions which i love it gives me the

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,040
same sort of interactions i spent all

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,880
that time on

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,440
and earlier this year we had to get a

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,279
hackathon to get up hackathon is a

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,279
a project which was uh to encourage

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,000
people to build github actions i think

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,639
um well not not i think you understand

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,160
that but i

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,079
i'm not thinking i know exactly what i'm

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,920
talking about just trust me

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,519
but i bring this up because they get a

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,519
hackathon we end up powering

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,839
again actions hackathon on the back of

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,200
action so the entire backend database

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,639
was a github repo

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,480
which i love doing i have kind of a

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
trend that i kind of focused on

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
in doing that um but this is github's

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
grip this is me actually doing the same

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,680
thing i showed you in probot

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,519
previously and attaching that right into

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,320
my yaml file so i'm able to write

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,480
javascript

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,680
directly inside of a yaml to check to

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,160
see if someone submitted

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,040
a repo for approval and then gets

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,399
applied here

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,720
and then we have a bunch of actions that

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,160
run checks to then like let us know if

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,120
it should be featured on the home page

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,200
or if it should be

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,959
pushed back and have them update it and

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,959
this is the way i did this is i

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,639
actually had my mobile phone up and i

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,279
would just apply a label to all pr's

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,680
that were open

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,639
to support this this github uh action

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,079
hackathon

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,560
and it was beautiful because once i hit

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,920
the feature tab or the featured label

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,519
they would just show up right on the

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
homepage because we had all this the

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,000
entire deployment process

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,279
triggered with github action so it was a

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,199
beautiful

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,279
situation and what i'm getting at is

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,079
like i knew we wanted to have a process

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,560
that we can

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,839
of a team of three we can actually power

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,760
this entire

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
actions hackathon on the back of actions

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
in pull quest and we did that by just

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,399
over

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,360
optimizing for this area 31. so

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,279
hopefully if i

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,560
hope this is kind of hammering home and

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,399
landing for y'all but

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,560
the focus is really find places where

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,120
you can improve with github actions

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,920
and then index for those uh i bring this

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,000
up because

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,800
uh the number 23 which jordan's number

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,639
uh 25 comes after 23 which is steve kerr

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,880
steve kerr is actually during the last

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,440
dance in that that documentary he was

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,639
michael jordan's teammate uh and he was

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,160
actually he was sort of like a

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,040
sharpshooter he was kind of like really

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,959
focused on

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,079
um getting to a point and making sure

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,639
three points were shot in or

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,440
the the jump shot uh was positioned well

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,199
for him

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,120
and i bring this up because steve kerr

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,639
is now the coach of the golden state

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
warriors golden state warriors won the

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,199
championship and

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,639
i believe 2016 2017 and 2018.

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,320
i got those i'm off by one year it's

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,959
2015 2016 2018

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,880
but anyway regardless steve kerr

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,639
actually coached an entire team to not

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
only just optimize for area 31 they

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,600
optimized for

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
a different place on the court and it

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,360
really was about

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,720
the three-point shot now again i don't

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
have time to go into the the whole

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,399
hoopanomics uh but i do encourage you uh

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,839
to hit me up in the discussions and we

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,040
can talk we can go back and forth

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,519
also on bw and twitter um but

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,279
on the court a 20 uh the three-point

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,519
line is about 22 feet

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,279
in certain points is 23 feet depending

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,920
on what corner of the line you are

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,519
and what i'm getting at is that it's a

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,240
harder shot

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,600
hypothetically but if you think about

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,839
the statistics

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
if every time if i have 31 of the times

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,600
i can have the shot go in

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,880
at area 31 that's going to be roughly

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,720
0.62 points

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,000
but if i have a percentage of how many

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
three point shots will go in it'll be

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,720
1.6 points

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,360
so what we noticed back in 2015 2016

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,199
um the numbers of nba games are all went

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,160
up it's because a lot of teams started

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,519
attempting

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,040
bigger three-point shots and i can i can

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,440
i can really nerd out about this stuff

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,199
and about like how different tools and

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,240
devops can really just elevate the game

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,839
to the point where

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,279
we're no longer worrying about you know

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,720
whether or not we need to leverage you

00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,360
know this type of css or that type of

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,440
css

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
we can all transcend and start focusing

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,399
on the next level

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,240
uh and that's what the three-point shot

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,519
did for the game a couple years ago and

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
it's still doing today

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,720
um but i digress i'm here to talk about

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,600
get action traction

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,120
and getting action attraction and i want

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,959
to bring up one more example

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,240
which is all about hacktoberfest and

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,079
hacktoberfest was

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,759
uh it's an event that happens once a

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
year uh powered by digitalocean and a

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,560
couple

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
other sponsors as well and the focus

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,600
there is

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,279
around encouraging people to contribute

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,880
to open source

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,720
and i bring this up because the project

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,880
that i work on is open source

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,240
and the project i mentioned before is

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,320
open source and i knew there was going

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
to be an influx of contributions coming

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,320
in so

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,279
i have a script to basically assign

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,440
people to issues

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,560
because what i want to do is i want less

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,480
uh

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,160
friction when people say hey brian i

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,440
want to work on this project

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
how can i get started or is this still

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,040
being worked on uh right away i just say

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,759
let's just i need the issue and then

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,360
we'll chat

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,040
so the first thing i did is i wrote a

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,240
script and i applied that to a github

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,839
action and i actually took the script

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,040
from pandas so pandas actually will be

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,199
in a

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,720
panel tomorrow um well the creator of

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,160
pandas will be in the panel tomorrow

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,319
but they have a script where they have a

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,000
bunch of bash or a little bit of bash

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,079
a couple lines and they apply that to a

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,160
github action and i love this

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,360
because i'm able to have anybody who

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
comes into my project

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,799
write a command called dot just

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,839
basically dot take and then assign

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,439
themselves an action

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,039
uh and it was a beautiful elegant

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,360
experience to the point where i was like

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,439
hey

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,640
i should use this on all my repos so i

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,480
then took my action

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,160
and then made it open source and then

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,039
applied it and it's in a repo called

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,600
take action

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,960
and then now anybody can go into my repo

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,240
and assign themselves to an issue and

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,360
then we can have a conversation so as

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,000
soon as you've assigned

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,039
an issue again area 31 i just know that

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,320
you want to you want to work on

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,080
something let's get you assigned and

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,840
then let's have a conversation

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,600
and i ended up taking that and then

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,240
adding a composite action

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,000
uh so taking that same bash embedding it

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,600
inside the yellow inside that repo

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,679
and now it's reusable for anybody on

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,200
marketplace so i encourage you to check

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,799
that out and that's just one example

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,400
again i don't have time to go in all the

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,840
examples um but

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,720
just trying to really encourage you to

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,480
take action and get action traction

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,799
uh and this is basically where i'm sort

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,480
of applying it to my open source repo

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,919
uh where i'm only adding it just by

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,720
pointing to my other repos as well

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,360
so again all open source uh definitely

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
check it out

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,640
uh i didn't go into detail of all these

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,320
these actions as well because

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,559
i do have a youtube i have a youtube

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,799
channel uh it's gonna flex for a second

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,559
uh but i do go into and break down a lot

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,679
of these concepts and how i implement

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,520
them in my projects

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,120
uh so especially take action it's like a

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
three-part youtube series of how i

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
leverage docker

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,120
and then eventually move to the

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,039
composite actions so i encourage you to

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,559
check that out uh like and subscribe

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,000
also if you're watching this on github

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,039
github's youtube like and subscribe

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
there as well

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,799
um and then sort of rounding the basis

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,640
as well i if you're interested in

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,120
finding other ways you can sort of over

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
index

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,720
optimize your your plays your structure

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,960
your devops automation

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,160
uh check out sarah drasner's repo which

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,919
is awesome actions

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,200
there's a lot of examples there that you

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,960
can sort of just

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,400
get your teeth in get your hands

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,520
clicking and copying and pasting because

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,520
i'm a big fan of copy and pasting

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,840
so definitely check that out also shout

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,799
out to the learning lab

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,720
lab.github.com if you just want to build

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,640
your first action uh

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,559
start there build your action and then

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,960
apply you know copy and pasted code from

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,360
stack overflow or from my repos

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,120
and then yeah move on from there and

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,520
then finally i just want to bring this

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,799
up

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,880
because i made a joke about michael

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
jordan's baseball career and i don't i

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
think this is kind of missed a lot in

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,320
history because michael jordan he played

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,160
uh for the farm league uh for the for

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,400
the chicago white sox he played in

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,840
arizona and he played in alabama uh and

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,120
then his career sort of ended abruptly

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,360
and he went back to basketball

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,200
and the only reason he quit was because

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
or he moved on is because the

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,559
the mlb actually they they went on

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
strike so he wasn't doing anything so

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,000
then he started playing basketball

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,600
anyway

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,440
long story what i'm getting at is that

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,200
michael jordan is actually on the cusp

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,440
of transcending the game of baseball

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,760
he brought that same level of creativity

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,320
and excitement enthusiasm to baseball

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,520
and just by applying the same practices

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,720
to that sport

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,640
so definitely go back in the history

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
rewatch all that stuff highly encourage

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,520
that

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,039
um but also take the same things that

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,880
you can translate from your repost

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,640
and open source those apply that to your

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,919
stuff and you know copy and paste

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,200
if it's licensed all right so uh on b

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
dougie i'm beyonce advocate

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
and actually i'm really curious if y'all

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,799
have any questions

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,799
