	Presented by Angie Jones, Principal Developer Advocate, Applitools

You’ve created your GitHub repo. You have multiple contributors. You’re reviewing the pull requests. All the signs of a healthy project are there...but what about the tests? Not only do you need tests to ensure your application isn't regressing, but if it’s a frontend application, you'll need visual tests to verify that your application still looks right. In this talk, Angie Jones will discuss AI-powered visual testing and how to integrate it with your build process using GitHub Actions.
