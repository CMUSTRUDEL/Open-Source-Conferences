Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Developer - DevOps

	Presented by Christine Yen, CEO/Cofounder, Honeycomb

When observability is folded into the development process itself, it represents the potential for a beautifully virtuous cycle: Production stops being just where our development code runs into issues, and it becomes where part of our development process lives.
