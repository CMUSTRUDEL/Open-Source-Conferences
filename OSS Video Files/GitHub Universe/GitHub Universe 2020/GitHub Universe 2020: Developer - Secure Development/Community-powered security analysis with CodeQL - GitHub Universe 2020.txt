CodeQL security analysis powers GitHub code scanning and has helped identify and prevent thousands of security vulnerabilities. Through code scanning, it analyzes your pull requests and flags up security issues as early as possible. But who creates these CodeQL queries and how do they know what to look for? For the last two years, a community of security researchers have been contributing to CodeQL queries that formalize their security knowledge. Queries written by independent researchers, enterprise security teams, and everyone in between now help protect all CodeQL users from security vulnerabilities. In this session you'll find out more about this community, the bounty programs, and the tools they use to help you secure your code. And how you can become part of it!
