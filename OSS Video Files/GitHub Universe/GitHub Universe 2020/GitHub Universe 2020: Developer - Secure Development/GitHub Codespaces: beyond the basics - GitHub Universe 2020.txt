everyone if you needed any indication

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,880
we're doing this live

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,279
i feel like that was basically your

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,560
newspaper right there

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,320
welcome i am alison wines i know you

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,760
heard a little bit about my corgi so

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,640
every presentation

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,000
includes a photo of my dog olive um and

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,800
we're to talk about github

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
code spaces beyond the basics um i'll

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,520
bet

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
a lot of you are coming from the welcome

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,879
to code spaces talk that my lovely

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,040
co-workers matt

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,800
and bailey just gave and if you didn't

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,200
get a chance to check it out i highly

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,440
recommend doing so

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
in their talk they gave an amazing tour

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,960
of what you might do

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
the first time you try out code spaces

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,480
but in this session

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,800
i'm going to take you a step deeper into

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,800
configuration through the dev container

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,800
personalization with dot files and

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,079
settings sync and why you might use one

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,400
versus the other

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,920
and a few tips from our team whether

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,880
you're trying to get your environment

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,840
set up with the

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,240
perfect personalization or you're a team

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,400
lead

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,320
trying to ensure a consistent setup for

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
teammates using codespaces

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,680
by the end of this chat you're going to

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,360
be equipped with the knowledge you need

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,320
to dive deep and get going

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,080
so in case you didn't make it to the

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,920
welcome to code spaces talk i'm just

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,240
going to give a quick recap to make sure

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,119
we're all on the same page here

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
at its core github code spaces is simply

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,200
a service that provides

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
managed cloud environments on demand

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,640
taking you from

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
repo to development environment in a

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
single click

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,119
but more than that we know how important

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
it is

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,960
for your environment in your editor to

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,439
feel like home

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,200
matt referenced dot files setting sync

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,159
and more in his demo and we're going to

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,520
break down

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,280
all the different ways you can

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,399
personalize your code space

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,640
in just a few minutes and finally

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,520
one of the reasons we think codespaces

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,920
is so

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
exciting is because it empowers you to

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,440
develop from

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,959
anywhere which as you heard is one of my

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
personal missions

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,400
any developer armed with a browser and

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,319
an internet connection

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
can ship code with code spaces and

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,879
that's what i love about working on it

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,720
okay so let's talk about what i'm going

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,200
to talk about

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,840
first we're going to look at two ways

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,360
that you can personalize your code space

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
then we're going to look at how you can

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,040
configure your repository for easy

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,959
repeatable use by adding a dev container

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,760
and finally i'll share some tips from

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,280
the team just a few tidbits that we like

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,879
that we hope you will know so with that

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,480
let's dive in personalizing your

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,080
experience happens

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,280
through two main areas or configurations

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
really

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
you've got your dot files and you've got

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,519
settings sync

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,720
and one of the questions i hear a lot is

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,519
okay allison

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
why would i use one versus the other

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,360
maybe

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
you just notice that your code space is

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,080
mostly right

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,159
and you're not quite sure why we're

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,680
gonna break it down here

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,959
so if you're using dot files we

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,440
automatically pull any public repo

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,000
that's on your account name dot files

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,840
into your code space and we apply them

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,200
at creation time

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,879
so if you perhaps use dot files to set

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,879
up your local machine

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,560
or you checked out some references in

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
the past and forked

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,200
a dot files repo from a coworker we're

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,120
automatically pulling that in

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,799
if you haven't been super familiar with

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,879
dot files these are

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
pretty much configuration files that

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,480
start with

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,840
as you might guess a dot so these might

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,959
be a dot

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,640
profile dot alias dot prompt

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,480
these are all ways that you can

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,480
configure your environment

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,519
and shell now there's a ton

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,360
of dot file examples and you can use

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,400
those as a starting point in order to be

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,640
perfectly optimized for you

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
and the great thing is although we love

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
to use them in codespaces for

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,040
customization

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,320
you can also apply them to your local

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,520
machine so if you

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,960
happen to accidentally throw your laptop

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,240
into a lake

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,560
during a really tough debugging session

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,919
you can always quickly apply those dot

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,360
files to any new

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,919
local machine then again it's our hope

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,840
that you won't ever worry about setting

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,080
up a local development environment of

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
course

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,320
one thing that's important to know here

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,040
is that we apply these settings

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,280
at creation time for your code space so

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,759
any changes you make to this repo

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,960
will only be applied to any future

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,720
created code spaces

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,280
it won't affect any that you've created

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,759
before that change

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
now that's one way that you might

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,759
personalize

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,639
your code space but the other is setting

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,199
sync

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,639
since github code spaces leverages

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,120
visual studio code

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,440
as its editor we get to leverage the

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
amazing work that the visual studio code

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,440
team has done to sync your settings

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,160
across these visual studio code

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,759
instances we keep it on by default

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,919
because we don't want you to have to

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,520
think about it but i'm here to tell you

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,000
just a little bit of how it works and

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,400
how you can adjust it to your liking

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
it syncs things like your ui state your

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
extensions

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,360
your themes your keyboard shortcuts and

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,120
it keeps those all in sync across your

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
code spaces

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,840
a key distinction here that i want to

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,919
make is that with settings sync

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,080
any changes you make to the visual

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,720
studio code editor within your code

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,919
space

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,880
will be synced across all of your

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,400
past press future so if you're kind of

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,199
mucking around with settings and you're

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,639
not sure

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,199
that you want this to apply to

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,800
everything be sure to go ahead and turn

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,840
off uh settings sync before you do that

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,919
and now to you know i can tell you about

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,680
this all day but i feel like it's a

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,440
little bit cooler to show you that it

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,319
does indeed work the way

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,840
i'm telling you it works let's go ahead

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
and do it

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,560
great so you can see here

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,520
i've got a code space up and running

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,840
already

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,960
this is my olive tracker all of makes

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,960
appearances

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,319
as many times as possible in all of my

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,080
demos so

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,000
we've got a theme here with the mononoke

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,160
and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,520
ahead and go to my simple hello world

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,520
application and start up a code space

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,360
now while we're here you'll see i don't

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,960
really have anything installed

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,039
only two settings sync is on by default

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,280
and when this code space finishes

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,759
running i guarantee you that we're going

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,120
to see

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,080
the same theme applied and in fact to

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,479
make things

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,360
cooler i'm going to put it side by side

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,639
so as i

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,560
make changes you can see that it's

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,400
happening in real time and there's no

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,400
funny business behind the scenes

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680
while we're waiting for that to connect

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,360
i just wanted to show you

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,240
a quick example of my dot files here

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,520
you'll notice i have these aliases i

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,599
love those they're great

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,960
uh if you want a cool one to try with

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,919
your own dot files

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,400
try this party one it'll create a nice

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,280
linear terminal just for you

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,599
so here we have our two code spaces side

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,800
by

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,199
side exactly as we'd expect and now if i

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,280
take

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
the one i just created and i can go

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,599
ahead and change the theme

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,440
to abyss it's going to take a second

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,479
that setting sync is running in the

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,479
background

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,520
and in just a few moments we'll notice

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,800
this one change

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,520
as well pretty cool right

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,479
but what's even cooler is i can sync

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,840
things like my

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,919
extensions so for example if i know that

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
in every single code space i want to use

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,240
this prettier code formatter

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,280
i can just go ahead and install that and

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,319
by default

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,039
it's going to sync it maybe

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,759
yes it's going to sync it right here and

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,759
then if we wait over here

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
and give this just a second to run that

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,560
in the background you'll see that my

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
prettier code

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,000
formatter showed up on my other code

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,279
space as well

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,599
so if you've got any of those

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,320
extensions that you'd really love to

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
have on

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,279
every single code space you can use

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,240
setting sync to ensure that they follow

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,560
you wherever you go

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,360
now let's talk about configuring your

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,320
code space

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,040
generally when you open a repository if

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,200
you don't have any special instructions

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,320
in the dev container that i'll talk

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,360
about in a second

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,240
we leverage a general sandbox to get you

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,880
started

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,279
we try and support you know the laundry

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,959
list

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,200
of languages uh in order to support

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,000
getting as many of you as possible

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,480
started

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,440
and you can see that list here but if

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,560
you need

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,279
a bit of

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
extra configuration perhaps you have a

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,360
very specific

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,839
version of python you need you're going

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,200
to leverage the dev container json for

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,480
configuration

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,040
now this is a

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,399
quick sample of what the dev container

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,920
file might look like

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,519
this is purely a configuration file

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,839
that lets us know how to build the

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,080
container for your needs

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,760
this is great if you're a lead or a

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,920
maintainer of a repo

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,880
and you don't want users to have to do

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,959
anything more

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,519
than click the opening code space button

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
now important things to note here are

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,720
that

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,320
the dev container is actually checked

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,120
into the repository

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,920
and so it is scoped to the repo not the

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,320
user

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,640
this is why it's great for maintainers

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,560
of a repository to leverage

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,560
no matter who the user is if they're

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,240
using this repository

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
they're just going to click on that open

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
and code space button and we're going to

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,440
build it according to the specification

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,640
that you've checked in there are

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,680
a lot of properties uh that you can use

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,200
in this configuration file but what's

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,640
also great is that you

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,760
only need to use what you need you don't

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,839
have to do

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,519
every single thing as you can see in

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,640
this sample screenshot

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,640
we actually have a few of them

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,800
commented out because we don't need them

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,519
for this repo

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
leverage only what you need and don't

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,160
worry

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,760
about anything else now

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,200
as i mentioned or as you might see here

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,640
we have a set of extensions that you can

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,720
uh itemize for the repository as well

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
and you might be thinking to yourself

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,680
okay allison

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,920
you just showed me how to sync my

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,880
extensions with setting sync that was

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,800
awesome why would i also add these

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,839
extensions to the dev container that

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,959
seems like two

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,800
different ways to make sure that i'm

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,560
getting the right extensions i need for

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,600
my development

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,880
well key distinction there

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,399
is setting sync is per user and so you

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,640
can't guarantee

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,880
that any person picking up your repo

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,880
will have the same set of extensions

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,440
that you might be using

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,680
with the dev container and putting the

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,160
extensions attribute in there

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,800
you can ensure that every single person

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,600
who uses this repository

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,320
gets this set of extensions installed

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,600
and so it's really a way to ensure that

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,480
everyone has the same uh

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
experience when they open in a code

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,200
space

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,000
so that's the general lay of the land

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,120
with our dev container but if you're

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,600
like me

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,480
hearing about a configuration file and

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,040
actually creating that on my own are two

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,560
very different things with varying

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,200
levels of difficulty

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,760
so i want to take you through a quick

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,800
demo

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,079
of how visual studio code actually helps

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,279
you create this

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,560
in case you want to go and build a dev

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,720
container

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,920
json for yourself right after this talk

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,399
so i'm going to bring this full screen

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,200
here

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,120
so you can see a little better as i

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,079
mentioned before this is just a very

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,600
simple

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,399
um hello world application here

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,639
and you know i find with a lot of my

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,279
prototypes i start just from scratch

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,079
and then i want to build it up and with

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,680
our ad

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,480
configuration files command i can do

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,519
just that

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,639
so perhaps now i decide you know this

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,200
repository

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,120
i really want it to be a python project

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,320
and but i need a very specific version

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,880
of python one that

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,600
our universal sandbox doesn't um support

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,959
out of the box

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,440
so all i do is uh open up the command

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,440
palette and i can do code spaces add

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,079
development container for configuration

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
files

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,200
you can also do that from your code

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,440
spaces pane so

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,240
here with hello world i can go ahead and

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,680
add development container config files

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,680
and what that's going to do is it's

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,959
going to open up this great quick pick

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,680
it shows me some top options but i can

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,720
also show

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,240
all the definitions there are a lot as

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
you see here because we really

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,399
want to help you get started fast and

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
i'm just going to say let's do

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,120
a python 3. and i'm going to do 3.8

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,639
because 38 is one of my favorite numbers

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,399
let's hope that's not a security

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,800
question somewhere

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
and i'm gonna hit okay and what that's

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,560
going to do

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,519
is it's going to automatically generate

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,480
everything i

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,040
need to get started with this project as

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,360
a

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,120
python 3.8 you'll notice it's got the

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
list of extensions

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,279
it's got some optional attributes here i

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,519
could uncomment if i wanted

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,440
and it's also got settings that'll help

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,440
make running this code space

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
incredibly easy for anyone else who

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,199
wants to pick this up

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,920
so that looks all great to me but

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,639
maybe i also want to go and add that

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,600
prettier

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,000
code formatter to this repository i

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
think

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,480
everyone should use this extension all i

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,320
have to do is right click

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,040
and you'll see we have the ability to

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,680
just add to dev container json

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,120
and in fact there it is so you don't

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,240
have to search through

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,800
for exactly how you need uh to

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
configure this dev container we do a lot

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
of the

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,959
early lifting for you to help you get

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,720
started and experiment

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,720
rapidly which i love

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,279
great so now that we've done that let's

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,440
hear just

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,440
some quick tips from the team

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,600
awesome so there are three things that i

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,480
personally love doing and a few of my

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
teammates love

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
too did you know that directly from a

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,920
codespace

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
you can create an issue from the

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,199
terminal you might have seen in the

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,000
keynote that the github cli is out

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,160
and i love the github cli i'm so happy

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,199
that it is installed by default with

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
codespaces

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,399
because if you're like me and you run

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,800
into a bug

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,639
i don't want to have to find which of my

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,920
20 tabs i need to

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,160
open in order to file an issue

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,880
and so i can just go straight to my

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,120
terminal in my code space and do github

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,120
issue create and go from there

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,240
and it's awesome i don't have to lose

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,440
any of my context

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,440
on that multi-tab problem

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,600
i i love having my code space in the

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,480
browser but every now and then i want to

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,320
leverage

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,639
my vs code in desktop installation

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,880
and i think matt showed in his demo that

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,399
you can actually just open vs code

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,320
and you can download the github code

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,759
spaces extension

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,759
and you can go ahead and create a code

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,440
space just from there the tip that i

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,720
will add on to that

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,680
is that if you want to suspend your code

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,800
space

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,199
you can do that from the desktop

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,600
experience all you need to do is right

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,120
click on your codespace name and you can

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,560
go ahead and suspend

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,680
just like that and finally you can

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,800
actually

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,199
open apr in a codespace

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,800
we talk a lot about you know working

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,920
from that repo page

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
clicking the code button and open but i

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,880
switch back

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,880
over to my

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,760
switch back over to my hello world page

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,319
here you'll notice i have a pull request

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,319
open and if i go ahead and click on it

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,600
i can go ahead and hit this open with

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,000
and do open in

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,799
code space which if you you know want to

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,520
provide a quick uh review of a

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,640
teammate's

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,960
changes without having to mess up

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,960
one of your installations you can just

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,120
quickly spin up a code space

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,160
and contribute back to your team that

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,520
way

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,880
i'm sure kath loves this for the prs

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,720
for her documentation i know her team

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,960
has definitely helped me out in that way

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,000
before

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,360
and with that that are the big

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,360
tips from the team um i hope you

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,960
learned some new things today and you're

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,320
ready to go off

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,720
and personalize your code space exactly

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,919
as

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,720
you need it um and with that

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,360
uh i'm so excited to take any further

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
questions

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,919
and super excited to hang out with y'all

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:15,840
in the discussions after

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,840
