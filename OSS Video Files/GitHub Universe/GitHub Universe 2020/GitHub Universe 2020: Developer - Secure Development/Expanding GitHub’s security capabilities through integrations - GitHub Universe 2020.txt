GitHub provides industry-leading native security capabilities within the developer workflow. Our code scanning, secret scanning, and Dependabot products and features deliver great value toward securing applications. Yet, additional security capabilities can be unlocked thanks to integrations. In this panel, we’ll share how third-party vendor solutions integrated with GitHub Actions can improve your security posture on top of native security capabilities. We’ll discuss contextual developer security training, infrastructure as code checks, and container scanning. And you'll learn about how to detect and prevent security issues in your code, how to ensure that runtime environments are up to date, and how to validate the security and configuration of deployment environments.
