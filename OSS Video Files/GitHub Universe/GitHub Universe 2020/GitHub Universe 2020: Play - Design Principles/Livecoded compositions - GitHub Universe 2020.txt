Publication date: 2020-12-12
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Play - Design Principles
Description: 
	Presented by 
Char Stiles, Computational artist, graphics programmer and educator, Livecode.nyc
Dan Gorelick, Engineer, creative coder, and musician, Livecode.nyc

Livecoded Compositions is an audio-visual performance—a collaboration between visualist Char Stiles and musician Dan Gorelick. “Livecoding” is editing and recompiling code on the fly to create visuals and/or music. The visuals are created by using a shader language GLSL, and the music is created with a coding library called TidalCycles and an OB6 synthesizer. Char and Dan will start with a short tutorial on how to livecode, then they'll display their text editors as they create the experience. Livecoded Compositions celebrates the serendipity and joy that can arise out of programming as a creative medium for performance and collaboration.
