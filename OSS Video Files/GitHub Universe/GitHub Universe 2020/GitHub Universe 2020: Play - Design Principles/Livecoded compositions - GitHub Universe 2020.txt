Title: Livecoded compositions - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-12
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Play - Design Principles
Description: 
	Presented by 
Char Stiles, Computational artist, graphics programmer and educator, Livecode.nyc
Dan Gorelick, Engineer, creative coder, and musician, Livecode.nyc

Livecoded Compositions is an audio-visual performance—a collaboration between visualist Char Stiles and musician Dan Gorelick. “Livecoding” is editing and recompiling code on the fly to create visuals and/or music. The visuals are created by using a shader language GLSL, and the music is created with a coding library called TidalCycles and an OB6 synthesizer. Char and Dan will start with a short tutorial on how to livecode, then they'll display their text editors as they create the experience. Livecoded Compositions celebrates the serendipity and joy that can arise out of programming as a creative medium for performance and collaboration.

[Music]

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,439
so

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,880
hey everyone welcome to live coded

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,000
compositions

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,039
um this is this composition is called

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,439
melting ice

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
and for the next half an hour we are

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,519
going to live code

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,520
in visual experience for you my name is

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,920
shar styles and i'm going to be coding

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
the

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,040
visuals for you cool my name is dan

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,559
gerelich and i'll be doing the music

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,320
so before we start our half hour

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,200
performance we're just going to show you

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
some of

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,039
the building blocks of what each of us

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,039
are doing with our code so for the music

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,239
i'm going to be using the synthesizer

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
that you can see right here

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,399
in this camera this makes noises like

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
this

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,879
and i'm controlling with a little foot

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,280
pedal let me do that

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,480
and on the right side of the screen you

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,799
can see my code

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
so this i'm using a tool called title

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,360
cycles and this is actually just a crop

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,000
of a text editor i'm using atom and this

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
lets me

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,560
actually make music with code so let me

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,520
start by saying i want a bass drum noise

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,920
i'll make sure it's a little quieter and

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,159
cool

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,439
so rather than firing off the rather

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,119
than executing

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,560
or interpreting the whole file it just

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,799
runs one line at a time so i'm going to

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,680
tell it to run this line

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,479
cool can you hear that sure sounds good

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,840
cool

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,600
so there we go and

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,159
so everything in the string right here

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
and the green is what's in a cycle and

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,880
it just pretty much repeats the cycles

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,759
so if i write another bass drum that's a

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
house bass drum

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,880
hbd um it'll do twice and let's do

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,600
you can also write it like that or you

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,600
can do 3

00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,960
four and keep on going

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
we'll go back and then what we can do is

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
i can also

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
um send signals to my synthesizer um

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,080
because what title cycles does also

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
all it does is it is it triggers samples

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,440
or anything else

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
so i'm going to say i want the sound to

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,920
be ob6

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,720
and i'm going to send a midi note um

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,000
let's send

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:25,440
60 to that

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,360
quiet right now can you hear that

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,040
cool and that's pretty much the all you

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
need for music um you'll see me do some

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,000
more complicated things but

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
i hope these are just the basic building

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,120
blocks so you can start to follow along

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,680
um and i'll hand it back to you char

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319
really exciting so on the left hand of

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,040
the screen

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,599
you will see a glsl code which is code

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,560
that is executed on the gpu

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,239
so because it's executed on the gpu it

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,959
is missing some abstractions

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,800
so how you color the pixels is you use

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,760
the pixel's position

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,920
to create those colors so the input

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,360
position is a vector two which is just a

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,200
container for two numbers

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
and a color is a vector four which is a

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,319
container for four numbers red channel

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,680
green channel blue channel and alpha

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,800
so um to create

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,480
visuals with a

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,560
pixel's position we use math

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
so for example if i wanted a circle on

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,840
the screen

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,200
i would um need to use a math function

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,400
pythagoras theorem which is called

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,080
length and built into glsl i can

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,640
get the distance of the pixel

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
to the center of the screen so length of

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,599
you

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
there we have our uh circle in the

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
center where the distance is zero so

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
it's all black

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,720
and on the corners the distance is one

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,599
so it's all white you're probably

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,680
wondering what this

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,959
bit of code does right here um at the

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,159
top line

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,519
um that is just normalizing the

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,280
pixels so that zero zero is in the

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
middle and then one one is in the top

00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,599
right

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
negative one negative one in the bottom

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,920
left in this performance i'm going to be

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
using a specific

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,560
technique called ray marching which

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,120
allows me to create 3d space

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,320
in this 2d screen using linear algebra

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:28,530
so are you ready dude yeah

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:37,930
let's do this cool here we go

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:37,930
