Description: 
	Presented by Tracy DeLuca, Founder + Design Strategist, How Might We Design

Ever feel like you’re just not creative? Our ability to think creatively is a requirement for progress, especially for developers shaping the technologies that will help us tackle global challenges. Let’s get together and grapple with some interesting questions: Just how rare is creativity in humans? How do our brains help or hurt us in coming up with novel solutions to problems? And how exactly do we imagine the unimaginable? You’ll walk away with newfound creative confidence, and respect for that three-pound piece of meat taking up space in your head.

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,080
hello github universe

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,559
i am tracy deluca i am founder and

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,759
design strategist of how might we design

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,679
which is a design firm focused on global

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,760
mental health transformation

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,119
i'm also the co-host of the results

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,039
mayberry podcast

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,680
which is a podcast to help you design

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,840
your life and i am so honored to be

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,680
kicking off today's play session

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,599
and introducing you to some concepts

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,560
around creativity we are going to be

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,120
talking about

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,920
sea squirts brilliant babies and our

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,040
biological imperative to create

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,600
so let's begin uh

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,879
most most of all i want to start off

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
with just talking about

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,079
out of all of the mollusks in the world

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,480
my favorite i'm sure just like yours

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,440
is the sea squirt and that is for three

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,559
reasons one

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,120
is because it's a fun name to say two

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,800
is because like it its name implies it

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,320
will indeed squirt you in the face if

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,039
you get too close

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,000
and three i also love it because of what

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,960
it teaches us

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
about our own human unique quality to be

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,439
able to create

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,720
so when a sea squirt is born it has

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,400
a tail and a bit of a brain and its

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,600
whole job at that point is

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,880
to go out into the waters and find

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,640
its safe perch to connect to and once it

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
does that it finds a nice rock a

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
comfortable little home

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,479
it will drop its tail and it will

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,400
consume its own brain matter so that it

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,600
can use those resources

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,119
for something more important and that's

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
because it doesn't have to do anything

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,079
else for the rest of its life it just

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,479
stays on that perch

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,960
and lets the nutrients sort of wash past

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,040
it and it doesn't need to explore

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,399
or be an adventure or get out into the

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,759
world

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,240
meanwhile the human brain has

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,520
evolved to have something called a

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,719
prefrontal cortex

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,399
and that occupies more of the brain

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,640
than in any other animal so we are

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,600
physiologically

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,119
designed to solve problems creatively

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,080
the prefrontal cortex

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,920
allows us to have complex thoughts and

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,040
to be able to solve problems and make

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,760
decisions

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,360
it also allows us to have our

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,360
personality expression

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
so a sense of self-awareness when you

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,640
think of who am i

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,319
that is all happening from your

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,560
prefrontal cortex

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,080
and then lastly it's about social

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,080
behavior so how do we

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,239
interact with one another those are the

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,519
things that it that it helps do

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,160
and it's theorized that while the human

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
brain

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,920
as a whole has tripled in size

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,040
throughout our five million years of

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,519
evolution

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,440
the prefrontal cortex has actually

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,040
gotten six times larger

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,440
so the resources that our brain has

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,120
has really prioritized this front part

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,400
this creative problem solving

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,200
aspect so you could say that you

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,800
are alive because you are human or

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,599
because you are creative

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,959
you are a human which means that you are

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,159
creative

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,360
another way to talk about this is

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,400
looking at babies so would you be

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,599
surprised

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,560
to learn that one out of four babies

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,080
never learn to walk of course you would

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
because

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
no matter how silly they look or how

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,040
awkward

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,640
or how much they fall down we can look

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,120
and see that babies are brilliant

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,000
problem solvers right they intuitively

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,239
know how to learn from failure

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
how to iterate their way forward even

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
without knowing the end goal from the

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,920
beginning so baby's not like hey

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,080
i've got to start walking here right

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,159
like oh this tummy time thing

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
is fine for now but like really i gotta

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,720
get up and just start moving

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,319
no there really isn't a goal because

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
they're in a constant state of

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,239
development

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
so every day every hour every minute is

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,280
a new challenge

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,040
that they're trying to solve or a new

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,599
skill that they're working to master

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,480
they just have this natural curiosity

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,000
about themselves and their environment

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,319
and it's not just these

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
biologically designed baby problem

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,080
solvers

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,040
it's you too so unlike our friend the

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,479
sea squirt

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
which reaches a certain stage of

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,400
development and then stops advancing

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,880
humans have this seemingly infinite

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,720
capacity to learn new habits skills

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,280
and capabilities throughout our lifetime

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,360
so let's take a pause for a minute and

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,360
talk about what do we actually mean when

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,199
we say creativity

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
right and that's what i want to have you

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,759
get out of this talk so

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,040
what is creativity why is it a useful

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,639
muscle to strengthen why do we so often

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
resist

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,479
being creative or putting ourselves out

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,880
there in that way and how far

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,160
can it take us so what are the limits of

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,320
creativity

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,479
and then i also want to talk about the

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,520
strategies that our brain uses

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,400
to create as well as to comfort itself

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,360
and then how

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,639
you can use these strategies to advance

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
to your advantage

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,840
to be even more creative than you

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,280
already are

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,520
because you know you are because you're

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,240
human and then what i want to ask for

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,600
you to do

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,039
is if you could have a pen and a piece

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
of paper or two

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,000
or a tablet or just some sort of writing

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,919
surface we're going to do a couple of

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,680
activities but i want you to be able to

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,160
write stuff down

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,440
so let's just start with a baseline what

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,400
do we mean when we say

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,000
creativity so creativity standard

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,039
definition you can just google

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,600
it forming something new and somehow

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,240
valuable so having some sense of value

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
that can be

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,400
an intangible piece like an idea or a

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
joke

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,320
or a musical composition it can be

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,440
something physical

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,639
like a product or a painting or a book

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,639
right when we talk about creativity what

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,319
we are not talking about

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
is artistic ability creativity is not

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
about

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,039
being artistic i can't draw i can't

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,120
write i can't sing

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,400
and therefore i'm not creative we hear

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,120
that a lot

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
what's more true is that you may not

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,120
have competently

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,479
developed the skills to draw or to write

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
or to sing

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,720
but you surely are capable of developing

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
those skills

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
there's something you can learn

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,919
something that you can refine over time

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,039
you may not become margaret atwood or

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,360
yo-yo ma

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,639
but you can reliably improve with

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
practice

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,000
and better yet you can just enjoy an

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
additional way to

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,560
express your humanity right

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,720
artistic ability includes

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,319
i'm sorry artistic ability includes

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,440
skills and talents

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,919
and things around fine works of art

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,039
but it is not about how you can solve

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,039
problems creatively

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,880
so it's probably fair to say that most

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,919
of you

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,880
in the github universe are developers

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,080
although not all of you but most of us

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,599
do probably work

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,000
in the tech industry to some degree so

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,360
if you're like most other people you

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,560
probably have had

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,560
some experience with limiting beliefs

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,599
around not being creative and yet

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,319
you stand at the forefront of developing

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,000
your developers or creating the ways

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,520
that your fellow human beings

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,840
interface with technology which has

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,919
seemingly limitless possibilities for

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,800
the future of humankind

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,440
so think about that for a minute truly

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,560
that is an awe-inspiring creative

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,720
superpower

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,840
you influence the future and

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,280
i just want you to to remember that so

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,560
we're gonna test some of our creative

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,479
skills and just do a pretty simple

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,120
exercise maybe you've seen it before

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,280
it's called 30 circles and 30 circles

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,639
if you have your piece of paper or your

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,319
tablet get it out now

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
if you want to draw 30 circles on the

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
page they don't have to be perfect

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,599
circles

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,400
um if you want to draw triangles you can

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,759
do that too

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,160
or squares or rhombuses um

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,240
and then i'm going to give you about a

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,280
minute just a quick minute

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,640
to draw as many

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,000
recognizable objects as you can

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,159
so an example would be the sun or

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,159
a smiley face okay and

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,919
just take this time if you have your

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,399
circles drawn even if they're

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,200
tiny little scribbles just take this

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,480
time

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
about a minute and draw as many objects

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
as you can

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,120
alright i'll give you this this time to

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,120
to go

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,680
and don't worry about making it perfect

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,839
don't worry about whether you're

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,080
artistic we already talked about that

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,880
just how many different ways can you

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:23,839
look at these circles

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,839
and transform them into something else

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,720
maybe think about ways that you can

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,399
break the rules are there rules i don't

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,360
even know

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,600
all i said was to as many objects as you

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
can

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,000
so one thing to consider is what rules

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
have you placed upon yourself

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,839
and are you actually capable of breaking

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,839
them

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,760
all right i'm going to give you just

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,760
about 10 more seconds

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,120
push yourself to come up with something

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,720
maybe a little different

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,720
than what you've already been doing

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,959
and i wonder if anybody will actually

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,640
get to 30. probably not it's not that

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,360
much time

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:29,440
i've kind of boxed you in all right

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,800
so just taking a look at what you've

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,839
drawn

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,519
yeah think about like you've created in

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,480
a very short period of time

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
with very minimal instruction you've

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,640
created something

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,279
something new didn't exist before you

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,920
started

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,200
and also something valuable and the

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,920
value in it

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,279
in this case is the ability to

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,160
communicate

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,399
your concepts so maybe you did draw a

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,680
smiley face or a steering wheel

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,320
or saturn right all you're trying to do

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
with this

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
is to get your point across to another

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
person around

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,040
what the object is that you've created

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,680
and that is valuable

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,440
we do that all the time this exercise

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,640
was pretty easy

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,600
we're really good as as humans at

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,040
creating solutions to easy problems all

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
of the easy problems have

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,959
already been solved for the most part

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,839
and so what we're left with are

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,360
the ones that are more complex and so we

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,320
need a way to

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,440
reliably solve those and so that's why

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,880
we want to use

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,120
creative problem solving processes

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,440
so there are a few reasons why

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,279
one is so that you can expand your

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,040
potential solution set

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,560
now this is interesting because

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,800
oftentimes

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,480
you know we're we're smart human beings

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,519
we've gotten really far in life

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,959
um we are still alive so we've been able

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,560
to manage to solve some pretty good

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,120
problems so far

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,720
we think that because we know things we

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,600
know some things that we

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
should be able to know all the things

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,360
right

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,240
and i love this cartoon because you know

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,240
it says

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
is this where you lost your wallet he

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399
says no i lost it in the park

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,040
but this is where the light is this is

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,120
where

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,040
my human experience has given me

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,800
knowledge about the answers so my truth

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,120
is about the world

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,000
are here and so when i'm presented with

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,240
a problem

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,680
i'm going to go to my own personal

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,720
truths about the world

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,839
to look for a solution and if i don't

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,320
find a ready-made solution i'm going to

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,839
take some of the strategies that i have

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,399
and i'm going to try and apply them

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,000
to these problems and chances are i'm

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,399
not going to succeed

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,279
as well as i could because i'm not

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,079
really

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,040
open to looking for other potential

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,079
solutions

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,680
and so what we want to do is to expand

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,639
our potential solution set

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,040
to broaden that beam of light and to

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,800
have

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,079
more creative building blocks or

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,040
materials that when combined together in

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,760
different ways

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,560
can give us new solutions so we don't

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,720
want to be

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,240
making assumptions and we don't want to

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,800
stay as tethered to our own experience

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,000
we want to seek new ways another reason

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,800
why we want to use

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,839
creativity would be to validate the

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,839
future before

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,079
investing in it a way that we

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,680
operate often in business world and i'm

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,480
sure you've had your experiences with

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,040
this

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,800
is that we'll come up with an idea we

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
think it's pretty brilliant

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,120
and then we work on it and we focus on

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,160
the details and we just really are

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,199
trying to refine everything before we

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
ta-dah present it to the world and

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,199
sometimes

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,880
it falls on his face right and we're so

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,639
confused about why that is

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,920
so we want to use a creative process to

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,360
really give people a way to communicate

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,160
back to us and provide

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,079
feedback and all of the stages along the

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,959
idea creation process

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,600
right so in my work often we'll create

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,320
the most

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,519
scrappy prototypes so like this one just

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,279
you know a marker

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,519
and a clothesline pin and some tape

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,639
and put it in the hands of in this case

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
of surgeons

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,680
to say would this feel comfortable for

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,440
you in

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,040
an operating room like could you imagine

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,000
holding this in your hand

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,279
for 6 hours or 12 hours or however long

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
it's going to take to

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,720
do the surgery and they can pretty

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,199
quickly say

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,680
yes or no and why without that

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,920
provocation it's hard for them to really

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,639
communicate about that

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,120
but with something tangible even like

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,440
our

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,560
circle drawings saying you know how does

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,800
this work for you

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,480
you know what would you do differently

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,880
what do you wish it included

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,480
those types of questions can really

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
start a dialogue that gives you

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
information

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,360
that allows you to validate your process

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,160
all along the way

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
without waiting to that big ta-da moment

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
and giving someone a gift that they

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,240
don't actually want

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,320
right we want to make sure that our

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,560
ideas that we're putting out into the

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,399
world to interact with other people

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,600
things that are going to be of value to

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,920
them

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,920
and then the third reason why we might

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,720
use a creative process

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,519
would be to weather the comfort the

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
discomfort

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,399
of not knowing so like i said we love to

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,440
know things with we're smart

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,959
individuals uh and so when we

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,560
don't know something it can feel very

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:41,759
just demoralizing sometimes right so

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,759
we want to use a creative process that

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,279
gives us some space

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,240
to really think about the challenge at

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,480
hand

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,720
and not make those assumptions not jump

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,160
to conclusions

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,639
so often we can feel threatened or feel

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,720
like this process is very chaotic

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,639
and for people who don't typically

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,759
engage in creative problem-solving

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,240
processes

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,959
it might even look like you're wasting

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,240
time

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,880
right like we need the answer today we

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,079
don't have time to wait for user

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,279
research or

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,600
you know some of the things that you

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,560
might want to do to validate the future

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,680
we want the answer to the future now and

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,720
part of what i do

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,880
in my work is to remind people that this

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,839
discomfort is actually

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880
great because it reminds you that you

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,320
are exploring

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,399
uncharted territory and for a lot of the

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,320
very complex problems that we have to

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,959
solve like right now

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,160
climate change and you know getting

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,800
distribution of

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
vaccines the pandemic to billions of

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,079
people

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,959
within a short period of time those

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,360
challenges

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,160
are not going to be answered by very

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,199
simple

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,560
solutions because again if they were we

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,120
would have already used them

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,560
we would already use those strategies

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,560
and so

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,600
when we're looking for new solutions

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,959
that increases

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,880
our possibility of success and

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,240
we wouldn't be working the problem

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
otherwise we would be working the

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
solution

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,720
if we had the answer to climate change

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,039
we would be working that solution

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,319
so we want to have an opportunity to

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,079
reframe the discomfort that we feel

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,520
when we're in a creative problem-solving

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,319
process

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,919
so okay great we understand you know

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,960
what creativity is

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,520
uh we understand why we would use it

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,559
so why is it then if we're on board with

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,320
those concepts

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,919
why do we resist so often this idea

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,320
of a new idea of creativity why are we

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,440
so

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,360
wedded to our old ways of thinking and

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,280
you may have said this i'm sure you've

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,480
heard other people say it's like

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,320
no we do things this way here or we've

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,440
tried that already and it didn't work so

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,440
we went back to the

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,799
the way that we've done it we've always

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,880
done it this way

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,640
right well okay that's fine if all

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
you're doing is replicating over and

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
over again

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,200
but if you are creating something new

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,240
you need to be

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,760
open to this idea so how do we

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,840
think about resistance to creativity

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,880
one of the interesting things that i

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,520
learned recently

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,200
is that the human brain is in this

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,160
constant state of flux

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,520
between two extremes on one side you

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,760
have safety

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,039
and then on the other side you have

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
novelty

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
and if we think about our sea swert

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,640
example

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,200
right at first that sea squirt was super

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,120
adventurous he was out in the ocean and

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,880
looking for his you know his perfect

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,280
shangri-la that he was gonna

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,480
stay for the rest of his life and then

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,919
once he found it

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,880
he sort of retreated back to safety

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,400
uh and so for us you know all of us have

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,280
a different set point

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,919
along this continuum some of us just are

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,960
you know more adventurous thrill seekers

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,880
um you know people who just jump off of

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,480
cliffs and you know have like their

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,400
little wings and things

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,080
like those people are on the far side of

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,480
novelty and then some people

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,320
are really about comfort and tradition

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,440
homebodies we have words for these

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,760
things

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,200
one of my favorite examples is thinking

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,880
about politics

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,799
at least in the united states our

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,000
language is

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,160
conservatives and progressives right so

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,919
either side of that continuum now the

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480
truth is we all live somewhere

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,200
in the middle but even the way that we

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,840
think about

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,520
simple basic concepts in our society

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,360
sort of maps to this framework

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,960
and i've personally found it incredibly

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,039
useful to think about

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,440
you know where am i on the spectrum

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,840
today because even if i have a set point

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,000
i could have an interaction that throws

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,960
me back to wanting to seek safety

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,799
or i could be fully bored like being

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,160
shut down during a pandemic and want to

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,679
seek some novelty

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,679
and so how can i how can i um

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,320
react to the different states that my

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,880
brain is in

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,559
so if we move towards the novelty side

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,440
that's really where we're talking about

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,799
creativity

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,799
so the newness the openness to new ideas

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:20,080
if we look towards the safety side

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,799
what it is about is comfort and feeling

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
that sense of security right like oh i

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,200
just

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,720
there was a lion right if you think

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,159
about evolution there was a lioness

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,600
tiger was chasing me

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,559
i got back to my my home base my cave

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,200
wherever

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,679
and now i'm going to try and self-soothe

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,760
so

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,440
when we're looking at solving problems

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,840
in a business context

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
uh really well it could be a business

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,440
context or a life concept

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,000
really um the goal is discomfort

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,159
but not too much and so again that's

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,960
going to be in a constant state of flux

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
we want to reliably find this goldilocks

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,919
zone

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,280
and so that could look like you really

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,799
learning and understanding more about

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,039
yourself

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,480
it could look like you really

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,200
understanding and learning about your

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,120
team

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,360
and your team having this language to

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,960
say ooh where are we on this spectrum

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,280
between novelty and safety

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,080
um how do we push ourselves or how do we

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,400
nudge

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,679
ourselves more towards this novelty if

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,600
you have a problem that you're trying to

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,159
solve together

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,080
and so you know we want to really

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,400
understand the mechanism that the brain

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,840
uses for creativity and comfort

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,919
and then that's what we're going to be

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,640
spending the rest of our time on today

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,840
as we

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
break these concepts down

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,679
and before we do that i really just

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,080
wonder just take a moment to think about

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,039
you know how have these concepts how's

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,679
this framework

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,039
come up for you maybe even in just the

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,080
past day or two

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,440
are there moments when you've been

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,640
thinking like

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,159
oh i could see i was needing to feel a

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,520
sense of safety

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:05,120
and i did some sort of retreating or

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,640
comforting or where you're just getting

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,799
fed up with being stuck at home or

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,280
whatever is happening in your life and

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,480
and you just needed to add some sort of

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,840
invigorating

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,720
aspect to your day and does that really

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,640
apply to you

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:24,840
you'd be curious to to know

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,080
so okay how far can we push

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,120
creativity so if we're you know we have

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,159
novelty at the far end of that spectrum

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,120
where does that spectrum end

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
and so i want to do something with you

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,679
you know

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,200
one of the myths that we have about

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,960
creativity

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,799
another thing that sort of holds us back

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,080
when we think about it is

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,400
oh creativity is only

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,159
presenting something that's never been

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,200
seen before

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,320
you know if it if i've seen it or it's

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,480
been done before

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,679
even if it's been done in a different

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,960
way then

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,400
um that's not creativity it's only

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,120
you know something that we've never done

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,720
or seen before so how do we get to that

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,320
point how do we

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,559
make that big leap into the unknown

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
and so i want to try an exercise with

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,640
you

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,600
this is another drawing exercise so

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,320
we are collectively going to come up

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,520
with

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,640
the most creative thing that has ever

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,960
existed in the entire world

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,679
uh we're going to do it in a few minutes

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,840
and

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,640
what we're going to do is to draw an

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,039
alien so

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,559
when you think about aliens you might

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,880
have some preconceived

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,600
notions about what they look like right

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,360
because it could be

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
what you've seen in science fiction

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,799
maybe the last movie that you saw where

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,000
it featured an alien

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,400
so you have that on on your mind that's

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,520
not

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,840
the alien that i want you to draw today

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,919
right because we've already seen that

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,880
and creativity is supposed to be about

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,360
taking these big leaps into the unknown

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,240
so what i'd love for you to do instead

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,840
is to

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,480
imagine that we're not on earth

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,039
right because aliens don't live here or

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,320
do they

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,559
i don't know um we're not maybe

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,720
let's not even be in a planet in our

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,240
solar system

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,039
and maybe let's expand beyond the galaxy

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
and maybe let's even think about if we

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,520
live in a multiverse

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,600
which is a theory um maybe it will be in

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,720
a totally different universe than we are

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,200
now

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,720
and maybe that universe has completely

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,000
different laws

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,799
that affect us so we're carbon-based

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,360
life forms

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,919
right so maybe it's a silicon based life

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,559
form

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,360
or maybe it's a uranium based life form

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,600
i don't know

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,279
but let's travel why don't we travel to

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,880
the github universe

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:01,600
um let's go there and let's imagine

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,200
what an alien from the github universe

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
could look like

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,000
and what are those fundamental laws and

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,840
differences that exist in that universe

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,120
and then what does that make possible

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,799
right okay

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,880
so this this should be good because

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,840
we're all so super smart and super

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,480
creative

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,919
that we can imagine what these aliens

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,240
are going to look like

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,200
so i'm going to give you a few minutes

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,039
to sketch

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,760
your outcome and then i would really

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,640
love it

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,520
if you wouldn't mind um there should be

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,440
a link

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,159
where you can take a picture of your

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,240
alien and then send it back

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,039
so that i can see all of the amazing

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,520
creatures that you've created

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,480
and then i can add it to my own my own

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,760
drawing

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,760
okay so i'm going to give you

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,520
this shouldn't take too long i think i'm

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,960
just going to give you three minutes

00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,000
and so maybe i'll lead you through

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,880
as you start drawing kind of just some

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,360
props

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,360
around

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,159
what you can be thinking about

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,640
and so yeah you're in the github

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,640
universe

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,760
who is there

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,279
what sorts of maybe there's planets

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,240
maybe there's not

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,840
and traveling through and finding a

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,200
location where

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,840
you spot an alien oh my goodness

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,240
like you're the first human being to

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,440
ever

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,919
come upon this creature

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,440
or is it a creature i don't know the

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,440
laws are different so what is it

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,880
and so really

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,159
you know think about

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,760
how does it well first maybe like

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,279
figure out what the environment looks

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,240
like around it

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,760
and you can sketch a little bit of that

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,200
but more focused though on the

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,080
the actual alien itself but give a hint

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,200
of what this world looks like and think

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,080
about things like

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,000
you know what what does it look like for

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,320
one

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:25,279
what sort of texture or shape

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:29,679
does it take you can think about

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:32,399
you know is it have a color or a sheen

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,399
some sort of

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:40,080
yeah just some sort of um

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,399
coding to itself maybe maybe not right

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,080
i'm not

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:48,080
i'm not uh i don't want to feed you

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,960
the answer but i do want you to think

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,799
about the different elements

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,120
and so it could be thinking about well

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,360
how does it

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,799
does it communicate is is there more

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,120
than one is it

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,120
in community or is it solo

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,000
if it isn't community

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:17,360
how does it interact does it interact

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,520
like or

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,760
maybe it's not in community with that is

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,840
like itself how does it interact with

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:30,080
things that are just like itself

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:33,600
you can think about what

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,960
what sensory perceptions does it have

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,240
right so we can see we can hear we can

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,000
feel

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,000
we can smell we can taste

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,960
does this creature have other sensory

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,960
perceptions

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,320
what else how does it transport itself

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,000
how does it get around

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,159
or maybe it doesn't maybe like the c

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,159
squared it stays in one place

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:07,200
and so if it is mobile

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,600
how is it mobilized and if it's

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:15,600
immobile then

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:19,120
what is it doing i'm thinking about like

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,880
okay what does a day in the life

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,799
look like for this creature what's its

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,840
main

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,480
focus or its main goal for for the day

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,480
for today

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,200
does it have emotions

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,840
yeah does it have an internal monologue

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,840
like sometimes we do

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,320
yeah is there a language that it

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
communicates in

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,520
just really thinking about the not just

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,279
the form

00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,080
of this alien but the experience

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,799
that it has its purpose its reason for

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,640
being

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,039
again if there is one not having one is

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,600
also

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:12,240
a fine answer

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,279
and so just giving you a few minutes to

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,279
to finish that up

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,480
and thinking about what would it want us

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,120
to know

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,760
if it could communicate if it does have

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,440
a way to do that

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,840
what would it want us to know about

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,840
itself

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:37,840
living in this verse living

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,840
by these different laws

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,880
yeah i really am just curious what you

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,279
guys are coming up with so

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,960
please please take a photo and share it

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,520
back

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
okay let's wrap that up you guys have

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,159
done a

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,080
great job your drawings all look amazing

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,039
i cannot see them right now but i know

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,320
for sure that they

00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:01,360
are wildly creative

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,720
so i did this exercise when i was a kid

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:09,360
i remember um sitting down to draw and

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,519
my the the challenge i gave to myself

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,960
was draw an alien like you've never seen

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,159
before

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,240
and so i thought i'm just like oh

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,679
my brain and i'm just like trying to

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,039
imagine something different something

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,519
different

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,799
and i what i ended up drawing it's like

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,279
you know i put

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,640
the legs where the arms go it was

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,399
basically a human form

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,480
and i remember feeling like no that i

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,600
know that this isn't

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,880
right this isn't enough this isn't alien

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,519
enough um but i really just couldn't get

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,080
to

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,279
this place of something i'd never seen

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,960
before

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:52,080
and then just a few years ago i went to

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,440
an exhibit for stanley kubrick who is an

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,000
amazing filmmaker

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,080
and i love his film so much clockwork

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,200
orange is my favorite of his

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,399
and i came upon a quote that he had on

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,720
the wall when he

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,080
was this one was talking about 2001

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,600
space odyssey

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,440
and he was saying you know there was a

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,120
story about him and his

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,559
co-workers they were all sitting in a

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,000
room like these really smart

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,640
super creative people very imaginative

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,720
and they were trying to determine what

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,600
the alien in the movie was going to look

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,880
like

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,720
and they were thinking and thinking and

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,120
they have all their you know visual

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,919
inspiration around them and whatnot and

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,279
what he said was

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:37,200
it soon became apparent that you can't

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,159
imagine the unimaginable and that really

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,640
just

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,480
i mean it spoke to that little girl who

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,640
had tried to do that drawing

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:50,720
it's like oh it's not possible because

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,840
i only have the creative building blocks

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,960
that i have that i'm aware of right that

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,600
i've experienced in my life

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,640
i have no more than that and that kind

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,360
of you know

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,200
in one sense it's like oh it's not

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,919
really true but the other sense it kind

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,200
of lets you

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,120
off that hook of well creativity is only

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,200
what we've never seen before it's

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,360
actually like we can't

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,000
we can't get to that state so there are

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,960
other strategies for how we do that

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,799
and one is really what i've already said

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,000
or alluded to which is that

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,600
what already is helps us imagine what

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,600
could be

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,240
so the creative building blocks that we

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,200
have are the things that are going to

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,480
get us

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,440
to the new novel and so some examples of

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,399
that

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,399
this is a peregrine falcon and

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,240
and a stealth bomber right and look how

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,960
just beautifully they look like one

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,720
another right so we can take

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,200
what we learn from our environment

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,760
around us and create something new from

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,600
it

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,960
so there's a whole field of study called

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,600
biomimicry

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,640
and that field looks at the problem of

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
solving

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,679
problem solving strategies that looks at

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,919
the natural world

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,200
how can we learn from the natural world

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,480
around us the

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,079
you know billions and billions of years

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:19,200
that life around us has been evolving

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,919
in solving these complex challenges

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,599
through its own evolutionary process and

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,760
how can we take those

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,040
and apply them to our own lives and in

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,159
our own environments

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,960
so this is one way another way that we

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,800
do that

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,560
is something called uh

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,520
go back one is called skew morphs

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,599
so this is taking objects that are

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,399
features that we already are familiar

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,800
with

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,000
um translating that into something new

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,159
so the past

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,200
helps us bridge comfortably into the

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,119
future

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,119
uh and so if you look at your phone i

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,920
mean this is an outdated phone

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,480
um but if you look like the youtube icon

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,119
looks like a 1950s television

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,079
well most of us weren't even around in

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,880
that era

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,800
so why is that the chosen image for

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,920
what's on your phone

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,800
and the reason is because that feels

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,880
comfortable

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,160
and familiar so when you're introducing

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,680
a new concept

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,680
you want to have a little bit of that

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,440
comfort on that comfort spectrum you

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,119
want to have a little bit of that

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,640
so that people feel safe moving towards

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,720
the new

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,720
they can be curious about it and it

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,920
doesn't feel so dissimilar to the

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,359
experience that they have

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,359
that they don't want to engage

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,760
and then really thinking about you know

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,800
the myth of the giant leap

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,880
is actually more about

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,480
it being tiny tiny steps over long

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,480
periods of time

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,079
and then we can look back and say oh wow

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,200
could you a mat like you couldn't have

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,359
imagined

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
uh 12 years ago you couldn't have

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,920
imagined what

00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,640
something like the iphone would inspire

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,280
how it's transformed

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,720
industries how it's transformed

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,920
communication

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,160
right now we can look at that and say oh

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,680
wow what a giant leap forward that we

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,440
made but really

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,000
the iphone was you know preceded by

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,280
the flip phone and other you know it's

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,079
not just about apples

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,480
other companies making phones um before

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,440
that

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,200
it was the cordless phone before that it

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,960
was the corded phone

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,040
you know and go back and back and back

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,040
and we can trace those things back

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,040
and that's really how we make these

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,240
giant leaps they seem like giant leaps

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,359
but they're tiny steps

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,240
over time and so let's

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,040
talk a little bit about how the brain

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,240
creates

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:51,200
because in that are pretty great lessons

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,200
about how we can then create so

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,079
thinking about there are three basic

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,599
strategies this was another concept that

00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,040
when i learned this

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,640
we're having worked in the creative

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,320
field for you know

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,720
a really long time finally discovering

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,480
that there's three basic strategies for

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,359
how the brain creates

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,400
was like oh i can spend less time trying

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,040
to figure out

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,720
how to be creative and more time

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,320
applying these strategies

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:23,359
and so there's three they're blend bend

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,520
and break and i will break them down

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,520
so that we can have a better

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,839
understanding of them

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,200
so the first one is blend blend seems to

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,359
be the easiest so

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,119
if we're thinking about skew morphs i

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,480
would start with a slide so that you

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,560
feel more comfortable

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,599
before we get to the other topics so

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,560
blend is about

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,320
merging sources so it's a pharaoh it's a

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,200
lion we put them together we get a

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,560
sphinx

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,640
right pretty easy concept we've got

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,119
a man we've got a fish we've got aquaman

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,880
um you know we see this all the time

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,440
it's a really fun one to play with

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,960
and to you know be an entry point to

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,880
creativity i think that

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,320
you look at kids like they do this all

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,400
the time in their drawings

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,000
so it's about melding and combining

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,119
splicing and weaving

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,160
bringing two things or more together

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,520
the next concept is bend and so

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,200
bend is really about changing by degrees

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,200
and that's why i love to share this i

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,520
mean i love dogs but i'd love to share

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,760
this

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,200
because you think about okay you all

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,200
started from wolves

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,720
and then over time you know breeders

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,040
selected for

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,000
these various traits i wanna i want a

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,599
wolf that's a little

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,280
more snuggly you know that's less bitey

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,280
um it's not gonna kill me when i'm

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,599
around the campfire and then suddenly we

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,480
get

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,839
chihuahuas and dachshunds and bulldogs

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,160
and all of these things that

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,680
we have exaggerated certain features

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,280
over a period of time

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:54,240
so it's about warping or distorting

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,760
we can also bend time or we can bend

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,760
language

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,119
we can exaggerate features make

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,839
something really big

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,839
or really small

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:09,280
and then the third one is break

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,440
and this one you know in the tech world

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,160
like breaking things down into pixels or

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,880
breaking

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,440
different sets of code part it's pulling

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,359
the constituent pieces apart

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,440
looking at those and then recombining

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,920
them in different ways

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,920
so a fun one that i think about is you

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,720
know we can break up time

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,320
so if you ever have seen rocky or any

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,680
movie that has a montage

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,000
you know we don't have to be with rocky

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,960
for

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,320
the six months that he takes to train

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,320
you know we can just see

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,960
a couple of clips oh he's drinking a raw

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,839
egg he is running next to mickey's car

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
he's punching a bag now he's in the ring

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,760
you know and he's gonna do the fight

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,040
we we catch up with him because we've

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,200
broken time down

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
and rearranged it into a way that's

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,160
easier for us to communicate

00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:02,880
so fragments and bits and pieces

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,880
um i feel like i skipped one today

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,280
we have no okay there's those three

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:14,560
sorry i just wanted to make sure okay

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:18,560
bend blend and break so now i want you

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:21,680
to actually get your alien back out

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,319
and take a look at what you came up with

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,359
and can you see i'm really curious like

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,400
can you see

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,200
these different brain strategies

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,560
incorporated into what you created so do

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,200
you have

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,760
elements that you took one creature from

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,920
another

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,560
and put them together things that you've

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,319
already you know been exposed to

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,160
um were there things that you

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,280
exaggerated features

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,000
so one big giant eye or

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,160
you know tiny little feet or hands like

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,560
a t-rex

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,480
and then did you break things apart and

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,119
re-combine them in different ways

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,880
maybe you broke things apart from one

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,560
creature that you know and broke things

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,240
apart from another creature you knew

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,319
and then combine those together so

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,040
you're breaking and blending

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,920
you know it's not just one one at a time

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,359
it's all of these

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,839
combined then

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,800
i also want to talk about the flip side

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,040
of that

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,000
framework so how does your brain seek

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,520
comfort

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,319
right how do we move to the safety side

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,760
and this is important because fear can

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,680
stifle creativity

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
so again those spectrum and those

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,200
endpoints on the spectrum aren't wrong

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,800
but if we're seeking new solutions

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,720
we want to kind of break out of the fear

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,400
so these you're probably more familiar

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,359
with the three brain

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,920
strategies for be dealing with threat

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,240
fight

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,079
flight and freeze and sometimes people

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,920
talk about fawn or there's other ones

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,760
but these are the three we'll focus on

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,800
so fight right

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,880
you versus me i have a better idea

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,720
who's who's gonna win this competition

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,880
like i'm smarter than you i'm gonna take

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,319
you down when we're in

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,520
that mode we really stifle our ability

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,680
to be creative

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,079
because what we're more doing is being

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,160
dominant over someone or something

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,760
right we're trying to win we're not

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,079
trying to

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,200
push the boundaries of what's new we may

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,599
think that our idea

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,520
does that but when we're in this

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,960
adversarial relationship we can't

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,319
actually

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,599
do what we want so we want to move from

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,920
u versus me to you plus me and

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,280
why that's important we're building upon

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,680
each other right we're

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,480
making it about the problem to solve and

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,520
not about

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,440
our inner connection it's

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,040
it's about bringing together this

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,359
diversity of thought

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,520
this diversity of unique life

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,319
experiences so earlier i said

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,280
you know you have your own human truth

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,280
um

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,760
the experiences that you've had in your

00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,560
life inform you about the world

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,599
but your truth is just as true as the

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,960
person next to you

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,520
who might believe totally different

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,880
um truths about the world which i'm not

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,560
talking about like

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,040
you know whether science is true or not

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,200
it's just your experience with the world

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,240
is the lens through which you see it so

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,640
there are facts

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,680
um but there are also human experiences

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,280
that inform you

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:27,119
so we want to use those

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,400
unique uh differences and looking at a

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,400
problem

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,880
together to combine those together and

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,440
see what new things can we come up with

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,839
how do we pressure test this idea so

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,119
that it's more relatable for more people

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,400
how do we strengthen it and you could

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,359
use the brain

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,920
creation strategy of blend here so you

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,640
take

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,319
chocolate you take peanut butter and

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,640
they're both amazing on their own

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,720
i will argue that they are so so much

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,599
better when you combine them together

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,560
right so my perspective plus your

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,720
perspective

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,400
plus for other people's perspective

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,040
about this very complex

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,440
problem we all have our own expertise we

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,400
all have our unique human experiences

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,640
wow look how much more robust and

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,560
complex this solution is

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,000
and it can that's how we solve more

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,119
complex challenges

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,440
right so okay that's fight now the next

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,079
one is flight

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,720
so we want to move from fleeing the

00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,800
scene

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,720
like oh i feel so uncomfortable here

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,079
like i just have to get out

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,680
to embracing vulnerability letting your

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,119
freak flag fly

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,800
you know being your authentic self or

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:43,680
crossing into the vulnerability barrier

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,839
and why this is important is because we

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,000
want to be able to have

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,440
curiosity right we want to be able to

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,800
have empathy

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,800
for a situation

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,480
or for people that have different

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,800
experiences than us

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,000
so in this example i'm saying that you

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,040
could use bend

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,440
an exaggeration or a warping

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,880
and in this example i was working on a

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,760
project for

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,319
rheumatoid arthritis and none of us on

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,560
the team

00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,480
had this condition and we wanted to

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,400
really understand

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,359
what does it feel like on just an

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,599
everyday basis for somebody who has

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,680
in uh in this case rheumatoid arthritis

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,760
really affects the joints

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,200
it stiffens them it makes it hard to

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,640
move and things like that

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,280
so we really wanted to understand what

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,599
it was like so we

00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:38,800
exaggerated uh our features by

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,119
wrapping our hands and our wrists

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,319
and our ankles and then we just went out

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,079
into the world and we

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,079
you know went and bought some coffee we

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,400
walked down the

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,119
the promenade to like a marketplace and

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,880
we try to interact with the cashier

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,640
and what ended up happening was

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,079
you know we'll never really truly

00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,839
understand what it's like to

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:01,520
live with that disease without having

00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,720
that be our life experience but we can

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,200
have a taste

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,119
of what that feels like so what it was

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,640
was increased pain

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,680
um over the course of the day just

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,880
became so painful to move which made us

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,839
irritable

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,440
um which made us slow which when we were

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,079
interacting with the cashier and

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,640
fumbling

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,520
in our wallets trying to get payment you

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,079
know the

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,880
the frustration of that person and then

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,960
having to

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,599
to manage that so it was a really

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,240
interesting empathy exercise for us

00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,720
and and taught us a lot just by again

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,040
like

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,680
exaggerating the features to have a

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,480
different experience

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,480
and then lastly

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,200
fight flight freeze right freeze

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,880
you go from no way forward i'm paralyzed

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,079
i don't know what to do here

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,119
there's no instruction we can move

00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:58,079
to taking any action so

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,640
take a little a little lesson from the

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,599
baby

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,640
right baby is learning to walk they

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,560
don't know how to do it

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,680
oh you know they're getting up they're

00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,440
falling down

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,520
all they're doing is just trying

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,400
anything they can

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,920
to get to the next level without really

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,640
thinking about what that next level

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,480
is so another way to think about this is

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,720
those creative building blocks

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,920
you know what was in your your light

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,359
source in the beginning of the

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,920
presentation

00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,960
just juggle what you got right like take

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,720
different elements

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,480
and put them together blend them

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,680
together and see what happens

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,720
um or in this case break

00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,160
break them down what what do i have

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,920
what are the elements that i have how

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,760
can i break them down and then how can i

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,960
recombine them in a new way

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,240
to get to something novel so in this

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,280
example this is my

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,920
good friend ina and we were working on a

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,280
project

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,240
where we had to create a a

00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,640
short film but we didn't really start

00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,319
with a script we started with questions

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:04,480
and then we were using the film as a way

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,480
to sort of synthesize our information

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,880
we tried a couple different strategies

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,079
like one was you know going into a word

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,839
doc and

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,440
just trying to write up what the script

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,240
was but we had so much

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,160
content we had so many quotes and things

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,240
from people that we had talked to

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,280
that it was unwieldy then we tried

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,720
trello

00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,559
and we tried to put the quotes on

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,280
different cards but it

00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,800
again it was like we couldn't process

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,559
this information

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,920
well enough with the tools that we had

00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,400
so we

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,119
decided to go totally old school we just

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,960
printed out

00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,480
all of the quotes and then we broke them

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,280
down we cut them up into different

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,200
pieces

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,280
got this big piece of craft paper and

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,040
just started like piecing it together

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,319
and we could very easily swap things

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,319
around and it just made it

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,440
possible for us to then come up with the

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,079
script and then

00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,280
put it into you know digital form and

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,599
have the editor cut

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,640
the film together um so just different

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,599
ways that you can

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,839
use these brain strategies both from the

00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,599
creativity side as well as

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,200
getting a little bit further out of your

00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,160
comfort zone

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,640
so okay i want to do a recap because the

00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:16,960
brain

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:20,640
loves to have a recap um

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:24,160
and so all right we know your brain

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,400
is a creativity machine never again

00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,040
please don't ever say that you are not

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,440
creative

00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,400
you know that you are physiologically

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,440
designed

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,240
to be a creative creature on this planet

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,280
you already have exactly what you need

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:43,760
to be creative you were born with it

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:47,119
we also know that babies

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,800
brilliant but that you are smarter

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,040
and you are way more creative than a

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,200
baby you can actually stand up

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,079
for most of the day and be pretty good

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,160
at walking

00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,839
you know so what else are you capable of

00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,839
what else is possible for you

00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,640
then we also want to remember when your

00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,119
brain

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:12,559
is in a state of fight flight or freeze

00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:16,400
then all you have to do

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:19,040
is blend bend and break

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,839
and i would love to hear over time kind

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,079
of

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,079
how these strategies come to life for

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,960
you and what that makes possible

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,920
um i did want to share a few of the

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,480
resources

00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,760
that i've used um to create this

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,480
presentation

00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,040
as well as just what has informed my own

00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,079
life

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,599
and my practice of creativity i feel

00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:44,160
like i was one of the luckier ones

00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,920
that when i was younger you know

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,280
everybody sort of has a moment where

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,480
they're

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,839
taught or told that they aren't creative

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,280
um some sort of some you know somebody

00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,559
makes a comment that just sort of knocks

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,280
you off your platform

00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,640
i was lucky enough that i had some

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,200
musical skills

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,440
and some writing skills so i was sort of

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,559
given a creativity hall pass

00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,200
right a permission slip that

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,040
then took me on my journey in my career

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,319
and got me to a place where

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,920
um i never had a question and now i can

00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,559
question whether or not i'm creative

00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,760
enough

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,599
or you know good enough at my job but um

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,200
but for the most part i knew inherently

00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,319
that i was creative

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,800
and not everybody has that

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,800
so hopefully this presentation has done

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,079
a lot to unlock that for you but i also

00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,280
just wanted to share some of these

00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,160
resources

00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,160
so well-designed life is a book by dr

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:45,200
kaira babanet

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,200
she is a neuroscientist

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,319
let's see she's a brain she's a brain

00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:53,520
doctor

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,200
um turned behavior change expert

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,200
and she wrote this amazing book called

00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,440
well designed life so i've read this

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,720
after i had had a pretty long career in

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,319
design and i thought

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,680
like i don't want to read another design

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,079
book like this isn't going to tell me

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,280
anything

00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:10,319
new but the way that she approaches

00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,599
habit change based on brain science is

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,400
really transformative likewise carol

00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,680
dweck

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:20,160
she um is the author of you know she's

00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,440
the one who's popularized growth mindset

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,920
uh versus fixed mindset and so talking

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,240
about how growth mindset is

00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,920
realizing just like this presentation

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,200
has talked about that you can learn new

00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,680
skills habits and

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,400
capabilities over time that you aren't

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,720
fixed

00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,559
with the brain you have and it's

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,000
immovable

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,000
when i was younger i used to think oh

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,440
well i'm just i don't i'm bad at

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,040
learning foreign languages

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,960
which is sort of a self-fulfilling

00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,880
prophecy the reality is

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,800
if i actually did my homework and

00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,720
practiced and did flashcards i could

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,359
have gotten good at italian but instead

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,119
i've

00:52:53,359 --> 00:53:01,200
let it all leave my brain uh connections

00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:04,720
is by james burke this is actually um

00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,480
a series a tv series that talks about

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,440
when i was talking about all of the

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,000
different

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,960
tiny tiny steps over a long period of

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,440
time

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,480
he tracks that back and tells you the

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,760
story

00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,200
from like oh the plow in a field

00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,960
to i don't know if this is the true but

00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:27,520
to the computer or a perfume atomizer

00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,160
to spritz on your neck to the pistons in

00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,160
a car

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,440
and how that operates it's a really

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,520
fascinating uh

00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,280
series if you can get your hands on it

00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,079
and brene brown is sort of

00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,440
my you know hero of the moment her book

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,880
around dare to lead

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,040
and just thinking about how

00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,240
vulnerability and leadership really go

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,880
hand in hand

00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,640
um i think is spectacular there's also

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,160
co-active leadership which is a book

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,839
that i read that looks at the different

00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,280
dimensions of leadership

00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,559
and so it goes from traditionally we're

00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,079
like i'm the leader

00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,520
i'm the person in front and i'm telling

00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,800
you where we're going and you're coming

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,200
along with me

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,800
it actually talks about well there's

00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,720
there's that kind of leadership which

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,000
actually isn't super successful like

00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,880
what you want to do if you're leading

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,160
from the front

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,319
is to be bringing people along with you

00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,760
um as you go forward you need people

00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,160
enrolled in your vision

00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,040
in order to take them forward but then

00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,599
there's also

00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,359
leading with another person or leading

00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,920
from behind which is

00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,400
you're sort of the spot checker for the

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,240
person

00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,599
who has the vision and you're helping

00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,400
keep them on track

00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,280
um lots of different perspectives on how

00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,400
to lead

00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,200
from more than just the front joyful is

00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,319
a book

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:43,359
um from ingrid fatale lee who is

00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:44,079
a fellow ideo alum she's done a

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,240
wonderful

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,760
talk on ted talk if you want to look

00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,359
that up but her book on

00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,000
joy and the different aspects of joy

00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,880
what we find

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,520
joyful um has a lot of science behind it

00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,880
too so i was really impressed with that

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,960
how to fly a horse uh kevin ashton

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,559
is another great book to break down the

00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,799
creativity myths

00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,079
and again he's a proponent of these tiny

00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:10,880
steps forward

00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,400
not just great leaps so he demystifies

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,040
all of the things that we think

00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,319
we know about creativity and then

00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,359
runaway species

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:21,280
this book out of all the books is my

00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,000
favorite and where i got the frameworks

00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,280
for

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,160
the safety and novelty as well as

00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,280
the three strategies for how the brain

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,760
creates the blend

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,520
bend and break it just blew my mind

00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,240
reading this book so i hope that you

00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,480
guys find these resources helpful

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,119
they've been incredibly helpful for me

00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,000
and then i'll do a little

00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,839
plug of my own creative ambition uh

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,599
results may vary podcast i think i

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,680
mentioned it in the beginning

00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,799
is a podcast to help you design your

00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,440
life and

00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:56,400
one of the things that was really

00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:59,040
interesting to me when i worked

00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,240
at ideo was i realized that i had

00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,799
started to take

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,079
the skills and tools that i was applying

00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,520
in the business context

00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,839
it was actually impacting how i

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,480
approached my life and realizing that i

00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,200
had the

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,319
potential to design my life in certain

00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,319
ways that

00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,559
you know i could i could blend bend and

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,880
break it down and then

00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,480
make new decisions and what that has

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,079
made possible for me

00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,839
since i've discovered that concept and

00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,119
started applying it to my life

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:29,119
is is if i think about who i was as a

00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,319
kid would have just blown my mind

00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:35,440
so we talked to people like dr bj miller

00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:38,720
who is a triple amputee as well

00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,440
as a palliative care doctor and thinking

00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,839
about

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,680
you know how can we use the lessons of

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:48,160
death and dying

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:51,599
to influence how we live we've talked to

00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:54,480
sasha sagan who is an author

00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,440
and filmmaker as well as the daughter of

00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,960
astronomer

00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,599
carl sagan who is my other personal hero

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,599
as well as andrean so she is the

00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,000
producer of the current cosmo series and

00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,160
she

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,240
was married to carl and they've created

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,280
so many amazing

00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,240
scientific but engaging stories together
