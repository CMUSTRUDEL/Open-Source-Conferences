Collective Mega Creativity & Innovation (CMCI) is a project that explores the creative process and its outcomes in a group that reflects an individual mind. One of the focuses is activating the five senses through creative problem solvingâ€”which can produce more robust ideas and lead to more culturally relevant results than individual creativity alone. These methods inspire people in groups to be more open to their insight, expression, imagination, and creativity.

hi

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,080
everyone i am mobina nuri scholar

artist and lecturer with phd in

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,680
creativity science

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,240
and i'm shawayo sirus artist curator and

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,000
lecturer with mfa in social practice and

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,000
socially engaged art

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we are pleased to walk you through one

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,439
of our latest methods for collective

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,840
mega creativity and innovation

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,120
we are in the time that everyone has to

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
be in the zoom meeting

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
in front of the screen all day long like

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,320
now

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,640
we engage only one or two of our senses

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,280
seeing and hearing however

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,879
scientifically proven that if we want to

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,079
be in our creative mind's

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,280
highest potential we need to engage all

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,680
of our senses

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
and be aware of them imagine you are

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,879
blind

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
and need to use other senses to

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,879
communicate

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,879
based on our research and experiments

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,680
with different groups of people

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
we created collective mega creativity

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,880
that presents

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,720
a simple effective parallel thinking

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,000
process to help people

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,680
be more productive focused creative

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
and mindfully involved

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
what is the difference between vertical

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,119
thinking and lateral

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,520
thinking vertical thinking is linear

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,400
but creative thinking or lateral

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
thinking

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,320
is a concept that was first presented

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,680
by edvard de bono the father of

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,720
creativity

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,040
lateral thinking is the ability to use

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,079
your

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,119
imagination to look at a problem in a

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:54,240
fresh way

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:55,520
and come up with a new solution if we

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,159
want to go from

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
a to b there are so many ways in this

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,439
puzzle

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,560
to solve the problem you can see the

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,439
difference

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
in this image that vertical thinking

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,840
follows the rules

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,280
and lateral thinking ignores the rules

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,280
to find the solution

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,440
what are these concepts creativity

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,879
leads to ideas mega creativity

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,080
leads to mega ideas collective mega

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,400
creativity

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
leads to collective mega ideas

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,840
if we see each idea as a singular color

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,440
we can say first there are ideas then we

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
have mega ideas

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
and mega ideas looks like a matrix you

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,400
create

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,080
and connect every two ideas to create

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,040
a new one out of it exactly like mixing

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,319
two colors

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,360
let's say yellow and blue which create

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,920
a new color which is green

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
if we think of ideas like colors the

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,760
number of ideas

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
that we can achieve and come up with

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,519
will be

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,519
so much higher in mega level

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,400
every person can create a matrix of

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,519
colors representing

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,720
ideas in a collective format it will

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,080
add other dimensions to the matrix

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,280
the creative outcome will become beyond

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
our expectations that is why

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,480
collective mega creativity is essential

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,200
to learn

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,200
and use it in the challenge we face

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,879
collectively

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
in collective mega creativity connection

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,239
is the key

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,640
connection of ideas from different

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,599
people with different backgrounds

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,400
it can develop those novel ideas that

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,120
exist

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
only in a collective level and results

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,560
from

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
collaboration

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,200
for achieving these mega ideas

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,959
collaboration will be one of the

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
main keys so how can collaboration

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,919
happen

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,880
how can we collectively add our

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,720
expertise

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,720
and create ideas together

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,479
we are all talking about collaboration

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,199
in work

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,560
and life collaboration become a term

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,040
that we all use for a successful outcome

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
still we often don't know how to really

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
use and create an

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,560
effective collaboration where we can

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,840
creatively solve problems

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:48,479
expand our innovation new expand and

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,479
innovate new ideas without any obstacles

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,960
thomas hirschhorn and social practice

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,919
artist

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,080
came with this diagram he talks about

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,120
the authorship and the outcome of social

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
practice work

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,960
in art which we found how related and

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,479
practical

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,759
it is to any various type of work

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,560
in this theory when each person engages

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,280
themselves

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,880
with hundred percent of their potential

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
and expertise

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,919
and take the authorship of the whole

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,080
outcome

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,199
the collaboration will significantly

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,160
change

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,400
the involvement of each collaborator

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,960
will become 100 percent

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,160
instead of small percentage of the

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,639
outcome

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,320
it will create trust it will decrease

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,199
the possible tension

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,360
that might arise during the work process

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:44,080
and of course it will lead

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,440
lead it to have mega ideas as an outcome

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,560
instead of each person have a mindset

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,919
of contributing 20 or

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,240
50 they have

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,199
their 100 percent input knowledge and

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
ideas

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,919
this was milk this will make us to have

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,840
700 of an outcome instead of a sloppy

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,840
100 percent

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,199
in the collaboration process all ideas

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,479
are

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,720
essential for creating a mega idea

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,960
mainly the process is more important

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,120
than the outcome

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,080
any mega ideas will be led to prototypes

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
a prototype might become successful but

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,600
the failed prototype

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
will lead to a new solution

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,039
we also need to consider each creative

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,080
process

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,440
is not linear but more complex including

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,560
ups and downs and knots and very unique

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,440
in their nature we created different

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
tools to help this process to be more in

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,120
the flow

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,120
and engage all of our five senses

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
one of the other key elements in

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,160
collective medical creativity

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,880
is sensory input as we know we

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
understand

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,960
our world through our five senses

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
to use a higher capacity of our creative

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,479
mind

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,120
we need to pay attention to the data we

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,000
receive

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,880
from our senses scientifically

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
creativity

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,400
will be faster in the higher level if we

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,319
engage

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:30,720
mindfully through sight hearing smell

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:33,199
touch and taste all together

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
now we are pleased to guide you through

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,840
the six hats

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,400
what is the six hats six thinking hats

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,120
is a simple effective parallel thinking

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,840
process

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,560
that helps people be more productive

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,759
focused

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,400
creative and mindfully involved in this

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
method

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,080
participants will learn how to separate

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
thinking

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,120
into six precise functions and roles

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,319
each thinking role is identified

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,440
with a colored symbolic thinking hat

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,319
by mentally wearing and switching hats

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,199
participants can easily focus on

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,160
redirect

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,520
thoughts the conversations and coming up

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
with new solutions

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,599
and create a matrix of mega ideas

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,599
collectively

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,720
there are simple

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,000
that can lead you and your group in a

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,279
great flow

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,399
these stages are introductions and group

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,959
agreements

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,159
to dividing to different groups of six

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,080
people

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,200
three activating sensors through a haiku

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,399
four roles of six hats and dividing the

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,720
problem

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
five finding the best solution and

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,959
create an

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,959
action plan and six explore the solution

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,880
introductions and group agreements are

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,640
always one of the best ways to get

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,279
into a group activity

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
introductions are the first encounter of

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,200
a group

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,680
even if you already know the group or

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
not

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,279
it is the first step to understand how

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,800
everyone's feeling and doing at that

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,240
particular moment

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,839
and window of time they will understand

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,160
the group's energy

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,760
and learn something new and more

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,360
in-depth from each other

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,839
that they never had a chance to

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,040
there learn various types of questions

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
that can be asked

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,160
and different prompts that the group can

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
set

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,519
while in this stage it is important to

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,399
pick a question or prompt

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,440
that is also creative and add to the

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,160
group's diversity and value

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,720
for instance a question like where is

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,600
your name

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,000
from what does your name mean or what

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,560
your name means to you

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,279
these are very identical and intimate

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
questions

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,360
that can give an opportunity to a group

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
member to share

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,760
not only about themselves but also a

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,200
part of their culture

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,200
and a memory that their name is carrying

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
so make sure to be creative in this

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
stage

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,000
a group agreement is a clear set of

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,399
guidelines

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,519
that a group will set for managing

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,079
discussions

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,160
meetings and sensitive information that

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,120
might be raised in the group

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,640
it will help the group understand the

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,680
proposed

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,279
purpose of this meeting give equal

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,680
opportunity for speaking

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,560
and being involved and be sure that the

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,120
idea will be heard without any judgments

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
in the group

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,440
the group agreements can include having

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,720
fun

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,519
explore an experience be creative

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,160
be open-minded there is no right or

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
wrong

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,800
trust yourself and one another

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,279
collaborate be respectful and enjoy the

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
journey

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,519
for this exploration you will need six

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,760
people to play specific roles

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,959
for problem solving and collective mega

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,279
creativity

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,000
each group member will choose a color

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,200
hat

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,399
from white red yellow green

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,800
blue and black which later on you will

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,160
be given rolls for each color

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,680
you can use actual colored hat scarves

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,640
shirts for fun colored ribbons or paper

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,040
if you are meeting physically well we

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
are in

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,720
quarantine what should we do if you are

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,120
in the zoom

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,959
thanks to the virtual background you can

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,560
use creative colored hat

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:57,519
as your background and move forward

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,639
this technique is ideal for a group of

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,440
six people

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,760
but if you uh if you have a group that

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
is

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,519
less than six also use your creativity

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,639
and invent a new way for example one

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,279
person can have

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,839
more than one hat and switch hats and

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,360
rolls

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,800
during the session just be as creative

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,920
as possible as the whole

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,880
intention is to turn our problems into a

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,839
fun project

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,839
and a puzzle to find the best solution

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,160
to get into the flow of your roles and

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,800
activate our senses

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,120
and the creative section of our mind you

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,639
can start with a short activity

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,120
based on our five senses and feeling

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,760
now that everyone in the group has one

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
color

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
they will be given various roles and

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,279
senses

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,399
to play with six colors five senses

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,680
and feeling a person with a white hat

00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,200
is responsible for bullies a person

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,399
with a red hat is responsible for taste

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,519
yellow smell black

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,720
touch green hearing and

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,720
blue sights

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,959
activating our senses is important as it

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,120
will bring us to the present you can

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,320
activate your senses by simply

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,760
closing your eyes and feeling each sense

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,200
or in other creative ways such as

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,480
true a haiku for this part you will

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,600
choose a haiku

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,000
or any type of poetry then

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,519
each group member will express a

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,079
specific sense

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,440
based on their colored hat and what they

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,440
are responsible for

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:55,199
for example this is a haiku from branzai

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:59,600
an old pond a frog lips in

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:03,199
the sound of water in this haiku

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,720
if you are the white hat person then you

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:10,639
will talk about the feeling of the haiku

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,560
what is it first what what's the feeling

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,760
that you are actually

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,040
receiving when you read the haiku

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,079
are you feeling sad nostalgic happy

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,279
calm or a combination or if you are a

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,279
red hot person

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,120
then you will explain the taste of the

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,440
haiku

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
what does it taste like do you feel a

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,959
bitter taste

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:38,000
sweet sour or a combination

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,720
and so on for other roles and senses in

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,560
the end

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,839
each group member can share their

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,839
experience with each other

00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
nature

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,480
now what are the six thinking styles and

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,800
the six hats

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,000
that can be used for creative problem

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,440
solving

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,480
the six directions represented by the

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
six heads

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,920
challenge the brain during the

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,560
brainstorming session

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,680
in each of these directions the mind

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,480
will generally

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,279
identify and bring into conscious

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,040
thought

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:37,040
certain facts of the views for example

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,639
god instinct judgments neutral facts

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,519
emotions and so on none of these tracks

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,399
is an entirely natural way of thinking

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
but rather

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,320
how some of us already represent the

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,320
results of our thinking

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,720
this stage needs a minimum of one hour

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,199
time each group member

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,759
will keep the colored hat they already

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,279
chose

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,639
and work on in the first half activity

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,880
agree on a time limit for each hat

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,680
times can vary from three to five

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,560
minutes per hat

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,279
six roles for the six participants in

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,399
each group

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,040
are one the blue hat

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,160
is used to manage and document the

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,880
thinking process

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
as a facilitator it's the control

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,240
mechanism

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,040
that ensures the six thinking hats

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,680
guidelines

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,360
are observed and summarize the best

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,440
solution

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:41,920
two the white hat calls for information

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,800
known or needed the facts just the fact

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,000
the yellow hat symbolize brightness and

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,639
optimism

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,519
under this hat you explore the positive

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,560
ideas

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,759
values and benefits

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,560
four the black hat is a judge the

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,759
advocate

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,959
or why something may not work spot the

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,920
difficulties

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,640
and dangers where things might go wrong

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,959
probably

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:12,160
the most powerful and useful of the hats

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,120
five the red hat signifies

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
feelings and intuition when using this

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,559
hat

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,760
you can express emotions and feelings

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,079
share fears

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:27,039
likes dislikes loves and hates

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,880
and six the green hat the green hat

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,039
focuses on creativity

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
the possibilities alternatives and new

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,520
ideas and it's an

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,640
opportunity to express new concepts

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,640
and new perceptions

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,280
make sure to stick to your role you're

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,000
only responsible for your

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,799
particular position like me with a white

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,440
hat

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,880
even if it does not match your

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,000
personality

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,440
why because here we are training other

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,559
parts of our brain

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,200
that you might not usually use it each

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,240
person

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,480
with a with a hat in a specific color

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
will analyze the problem based on their

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,160
thinking styles for example

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,960
green as a very creative person blue hat

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,120
as facilitator asking other hats to

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,840
share their thoughts and ideas

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,880
manage the discussion and balance each

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,240
person's

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,360
uh talking time because some people

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,960
definitely are

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,600
shy and some people are more talkative

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,520
if you have a red hat you express your

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,960
feeling about that specific

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,960
problem and so on

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,640
in the end all the discussion and

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,880
information

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,160
answers and solutions that gathered by

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,799
the blue hat

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,760
will be evaluated and discussed in the

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,320
group
