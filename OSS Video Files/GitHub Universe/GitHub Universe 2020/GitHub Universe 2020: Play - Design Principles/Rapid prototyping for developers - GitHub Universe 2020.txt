Title: Rapid prototyping for developers - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Play - Design Principles
Description: 
	Presented by Olivia Wong, Senior Partner, Prototype Thinking Labs

Did you know that 85% of the reasons a product fails can be discovered in a few simple experiments without a functional prototype? We know we need to test, but we rarely get in front of users as early or often as we should. In this talk, we’ll show you how to prototype and test the biggest existential questions in hours. You’ll walk away with tangible examples and a new toolkit that anyone can use. Prototype Thinking is a method born at GoogleX for increasing the speed of learning by 10x or more. Using dozens of rapid, low-cost prototypes and simulation-based experiments, Prototype Thinking teams ensure that they not only build a product right but that they are building the right product.
