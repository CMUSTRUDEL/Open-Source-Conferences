Title: Rapid prototyping for developers - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Play - Design Principles
Description: 
	Presented by Olivia Wong, Senior Partner, Prototype Thinking Labs

Did you know that 85% of the reasons a product fails can be discovered in a few simple experiments without a functional prototype? We know we need to test, but we rarely get in front of users as early or often as we should. In this talk, we’ll show you how to prototype and test the biggest existential questions in hours. You’ll walk away with tangible examples and a new toolkit that anyone can use. Prototype Thinking is a method born at GoogleX for increasing the speed of learning by 10x or more. Using dozens of rapid, low-cost prototypes and simulation-based experiments, Prototype Thinking teams ensure that they not only build a product right but that they are building the right product.

hi everyone

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,880
it's so nice to have you today i hope

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,679
you are doing well and staying safe at

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,599
home

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
my name is olivia and i am going to

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,560
introduce you to a breakthrough

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
methodology

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,080
called prototype thinking now prototype

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,640
thinking

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,240
is a set of tools for creating very

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
rapid prototypes

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,000
it was originally designed at google x

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,720
and we've refined it over a number of

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,560
years

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,160
so that you can apply it to almost any

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,360
sector any startup

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,559
non-profit corporate innovation lab

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,559
enterprise you name it the great thing

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,120
about prototype thinking is that you can

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,320
do this

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,120
at home without any technology so

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,559
it's a tool that really can democratize

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,640
the speed of learning

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,000
but also the speed at which you iterate

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,440
and test

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
so let's get started

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
a little bit about me i'm a senior

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,399
partner of a company called prototype

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,239
thinking labs

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
we're based in the bay area although

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,840
right now i'm in vancouver canada which

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,400
is where i live

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,600
other things i have been a humanitarian

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,920
i used to work

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,760
in war zones and in conflict zones

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,159
specifically in syria during the peak of

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
the crisis in 2012 and in fukushima

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,360
japan

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,200
and then after that i left the nonprofit

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,400
world and i started my own company

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,920
well actually a number of companies

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
which many have failed and this one has

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,720
survived

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,720
so here i am today i'm also a beauty

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,159
queen during covid i want a beauty

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,640
pageant so if you have a chance

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,000
ask me because it's a really funny story

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,320
i'd love to tell it

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,759
and lastly a little bit more context

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
about prototype thinking before i

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,240
actually

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
tell you and show you how to use the

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,119
methodology it is the next evolution

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
of design thinking and design sprints so

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
if you're looking for a great technique

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,720
that is human-centered it's

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,000
empathy-based it helps you creatively

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,880
solve problems in

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,759
10 times the speed with less effort and

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,320
cost

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
this is your this is your technology

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,119
this is your approach

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,360
and this is my favorite methodology of

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,360
all

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,799
all right so i'm going to be asking a

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
lot of questions and i know that i can't

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,759
hear you right now because

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,440
you're on the other side of that screen

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,760
but i'd love for you to shout out that

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,760
answer out loud if you can you can talk

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,280
to your cat or your dog your roommate

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,440
or you can just say it out loud in your

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
head so my first question

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,319
is do you remember google glass like

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,760
does anyone remember google glass

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,280
i'm from the bay area born and raised in

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,120
san francisco and i definitely remember

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,560
this and i also remember that no one is

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,720
using it right now

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,720
so the backstory of google glass is that

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,239
this was the very first use case for

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,560
prototype thinking

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,040
and if you can remember back into the

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,360
early 2010s when google glass first came

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
out

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
everyone thought this was a hot sexy

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,360
tech toy

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,720
it was so cool you know you could pull

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,640
it out of your pocket

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,080
put it um well actually you wouldn't

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,760
have to you wouldn't have to pull it out

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,599
of your pocket because google glass

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,519
would actually project anything in your

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,440
phone onto your visual display

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,360
so imagine you're driving in your car

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,959
you don't need to listen to your gps you

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
don't need to swipe on your phone

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,480
google glass is projecting the

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,239
directions of where you're going onto

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
the dashboard of your car

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,319
you could also be in a conference forget

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,159
everybody's name and google glass would

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,000
project the name of the person

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,440
and hover it above their head like i

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,480
loved this concept it was so cool

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,840
i want to ask you another question so

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,480
where is google glass today do you know

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
do you see people using it if you google

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,920
search

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,360
the word google glass find no shortage

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,280
of articles calling it

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
the biggest technology flop in google's

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
history a lot of people know

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,040
of google glass as that cool invention

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
that really didn't get adopted by the

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
mainstream market

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,000
and there were a lot of issues with it

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,319
people didn't want to be on buses or

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
on trains or you know walking down the

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
street

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,400
and have conversations with people not

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,159
knowing if they were recorded

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,159
there were also a lot of features that

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,799
made it cool but it just wasn't sticky

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,799
enough

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,000
for someone to want to replace their

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,360
regular glasses with google glass

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,319
however the least known fact about

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,159
google glass

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,840
is that it's relatively successful in a

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,080
range of commercial industries

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,159
in places like surgery where surgeons

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,400
are using google glass to project the

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,199
details of the surgery over the body of

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,720
work

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
you also see it in industrial

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,639
manufacturing and specs

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,440
people are using this to build airplanes

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
and repair cars

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,840
there are a number of different

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,840
companies that are licensing this

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,080
technology from google right now so it

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
is

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,560
actually thriving as an enterprise

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,840
solution now i want to ask you another

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,120
question so this picture that you're

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
seeing right now that's a picture of

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
larry page

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,919
one of our partners tom took this

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
picture of larry on the very first days

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,000
that the x team

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
was gathered to build out this prototype

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
and my next question is

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
how long do you think it took to build

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,800
this very first

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,400
prototype ugly prototype that you see

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,000
right now

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:03,280
take a guess three years

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,280
two months a day what do you think

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,680
well it actually took four hours and i'm

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,039
going to show you exactly how that was

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
done

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,479
over here is an experiment and this

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
experiment

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,360
is to solve for what would it be like if

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,680
you could walk around the world

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,440
and have digital information overlaid

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,000
onto your physical environment

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,680
so we have a coat hanger the bottom the

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
top portion is bent to go above your

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,759
neck

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
and the bottom portion rests against

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
your chest that's connected to a pico

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
projector and plexiglass and a sheet

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
protector

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,479
you can buy a sheet protector at a

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,120
walgreens or you know any type of

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,479
convenience store and really what this

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,560
allows you to do is

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
hold this contraption and have that

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,160
digital information

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,759
projected into your physical environment

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
so perhaps you could be walking down the

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
street

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,680
and instead of walking into a restaurant

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
you could pull up the yelp ratings

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,960
before

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,479
you go in you can't see it here but the

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,039
netbook was actually placed into a

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,160
woman's

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
satchel so across body purse that day so

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,199
that you could have

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,120
this stimulated hands-free experience

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,560
in the next experiment over here you're

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,919
going to see hair bands which are

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,440
connected to fishing line

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,919
and then run through this contraption

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,560
that ultimately toggles a presentation

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
clicker

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,759
so you could hold these hair bands and

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,960
swipe right and swipe left

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,720
actually move things in your phone or

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,319
on your computer so you could swipe

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,520
right and go forward and email in your

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
inbox swipe back

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,160
maybe go back and email toggle through

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,919
photos it gave you this really basic and

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,520
simple functionality of being able to

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,840
control your phone

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,520
and the challenge that actually led to

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,880
this design and this creation

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,960
was what if google was in your brain

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,479
over here we have an experiment to

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,880
essentially test

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,800
how the google glass might be able to

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,319
fit on someone's face to make it really

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
comfortable and seamless

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,840
from day to night so what we have is

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,000
modeling wire

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
that was cut and framed in the exact

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,080
same shape

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,599
of the glasses and then clay which was

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
cut in the exact same

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
weight as the electronic components and

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,160
then that clay was taped on different

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,160
places on the glasses so the team could

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
experiment with how to best distribute

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
the weight

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,120
and something that they learned in just

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,319
the first few days and hours

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,680
was that you actually are able a human

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,319
a human body is able to hold a lot more

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,639
weight

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,560
in the back their ears and so if you

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,400
want to make glasses comfortable you'll

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
add weight to the back of your ears

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,520
which acts as a fulcrum lifting the

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
glasses off your nose making it more

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,919
comfortable

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,319
i know you guys have probably played

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,199
with vr glasses and lots of headsets and

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,759
you know how

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,440
top heavy they are right can you imagine

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,680
someone wanting to wear that from

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,000
9am to a 12 o'clock meeting to go to

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
lunch it's impossible

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,800
and the fact that the x team was able to

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,960
find this critical consumer insight

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
in just the first few hours of testing

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
is remarkable

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,080
because anyone building face related

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,479
hardware therefore after in the future

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,479
even to this day in 2020 would have to

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,400
know that insight

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,879
so over the course of several months the

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,319
x team ran hundreds of rapid iterations

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,479
and they came to the conclusion that

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,280
there just wasn't enough information

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,960
to support a consumer's day-to-day use

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
so they went to leadership and they said

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,000
hey

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,479
we have these two recommendations we can

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
either

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,560
go directly to enterprise because we

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,680
know we have the applications

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
we know it can work or we can wait

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
around

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,599
a little bit more build out more

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,479
applications make it more sticky for

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,240
consumers

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,560
and then launch for consumers in a few

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,479
years okay so i'm in the business of

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,159
asking questions i love to ask questions

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,640
what do you think leadership said

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,320
what direction do you think they went in

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,880
well if you know the story leadership

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
said

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,880
let's go to consumer now because it's so

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,480
cool and they did

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,040
and they went directly to consumer and

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,880
it was huge flop we had people

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
who did want to wear google glass and

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
there were some people who didn't want

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,279
to look like

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,200
schwarzenegger they didn't want to be

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,800
associated with sort of this really

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,680
really early adoptive

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,519
technology that wasn't very consumer and

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,480
mass market friendly

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,399
and so what happened is later they did

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
google did launch for enterprise but

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,720
they launched much slower than they

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
needed to

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
and there were already other competitors

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,440
by the time that they got there

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
so why did i spend 10 minutes teaching

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,080
you

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,600
about about prototype thinking and its

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
use of google glass especially if you're

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,760
not building face related hardware

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,120
well because there are some really key

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
lessons that we learn

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
and the first lesson that i want to

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
share with you is that there is a very

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,240
big difference between

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
having a cool idea and the data that you

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,560
get back

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,080
even the team at google x the smartest

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
team in the world like can you imagine

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,959
the type of people

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,120
that are working on these disruptive

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,399
innovations they used to call this

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760
department the department of science

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
fiction because they were working on

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,800
technologies and products

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
that wouldn't be used in this day and

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,519
age maybe somewhere in the future

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,160
and even sergey brin being the sort of

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,480
leader who had amazing smart ideas

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,399
he even argued that google glass would

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,640
work and it should be red the display

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,320
should be red because red is the least

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,720
energetic photon of light and because

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,120
it's always read in science fiction

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
so this story really is about listening

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,640
to the data that comes back

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,399
because the x team did test a google

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
glass with a red display

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,680
and they immediately found that it was

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,440
the worst color to test with

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,880
because red is very difficult to

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,240
separate from the other colors in your

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,519
physical environment so you're just

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
constantly walking through the world

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,600
seeing everything in the color red and

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,760
that's not very fun

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,680
this story is also listening to the data

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,560
and letting the data drive your decision

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
making

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,320
you know we are often in board rooms in

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,959
meeting rooms on

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,560
in team huddles where everyone has a

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,880
very strong opinion

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,680
we call these guess-a-thons people come

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,440
with their

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
inflated opinions of what they think

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,680
will work and what they think will be

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,959
true

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
sometimes it's people who are the

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,440
loudest in the room you've constantly

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
heard about this

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
people who are the hippos the highest

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
paid people in the room the people who

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,560
just have that seniority and can get

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,640
their opinion to the top

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,920
well this is about democratizing

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,720
opinions and actually

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,600
following the experimental outcomes that

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
come back

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
and letting us use that to drive the

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,120
conversation

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,560
because if we can do that we can make

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,200
sure that whatever we build

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,120
for our customer really works from them

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,760
at every single touch point and from end

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
to end

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,600
because it's actually been validated by

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,279
customer data

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,720
the next lesson that we learn is that

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,120
there is a difference between something

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
called

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,160
a conjecture and an actual in the design

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,279
world we use the word hypothesis or an

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
assumption

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,480
all the time it's the most used word if

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,720
you sit down

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
in a design thinking sprint that is what

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
we're doing we're taking what we know to

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
be true

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,040
uh what we think we know to be true and

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,120
turning that into

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,560
actuals which are learnings that are

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,360
directly observing

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,519
human behavior now a conjecture is not

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,639
bad a conjecture is a hypothesis it's an

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,120
educated guess

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,800
it's what we learn from market research

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,839
from interviews from what people

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,959
say they think they want but the thing

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,279
about conjectures

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,079
is that they're speculative they're also

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,120
less accurate

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,519
and precise actuals are the best

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,880
form the highest resolution and reliable

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,800
data that we can get

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,880
because it's what we observe in the real

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,600
world so i'll give you an example

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,079
in quarantine i thought that i was going

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,760
to

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,760
be a beast at the gym i thought that i

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,839
would go to work out

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,920
possibly four times a week maybe five

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,760
times what else was i doing right

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,440
we have this like little gym downstairs

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,440
and i was going to put it on my calendar

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,279
and go every single day

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,200
now that is my conjecture i

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,800
self-predicted that i would work out

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
four to five times a week and the

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
reality is i've probably worked out

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,480
maybe

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,040
once twice like at best zero times a

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,519
week

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,720
that's the actual and the reason why we

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,639
make this distinction

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,920
is because we want to take all of our

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,120
conjectures

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,800
around a user-oriented product and go

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,639
run experiments we want to turn our

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,800
conjectures into experience

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,560
and let our actuals become our decisions

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,920
the next lesson that we learn is we're

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,040
always looking for something called a

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,399
magic moment

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,440
now in design a magic moment for us is

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,800
0 to 10 seconds of when you can create

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,240
a truly delicious impactful delightful

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,240
experience for your customers

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,160
it's when you're giving them the sense

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
that whoa like i've never done this

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,600
before this is so cool

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,959
i need to tell tell all my friends about

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,639
it i need to

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,000
you know it on product hunt i need to

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,399
talk about it on yelp

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,680
you are giving them this experience of a

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,199
moment of service

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,199
you're fundamentally impacting their

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,880
life in a way that cannot be faked

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,800
and it cannot be manufactured or

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,199
engineered and so

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,680
this magic moment is really valuable

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,399
because it allows us to understand

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
whether

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
our product or service has the potential

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,720
to be

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,600
something great now in the example of

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,560
google glass

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,079
here we have a picture of a surgeon and

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
i want to explain to you something that

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,120
happens in surgery

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,880
that a lot of non-surgeons don't know

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480
and i personally had to learn this

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,600
from people who were in the operating

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,440
room there's a moment in surgery

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,199
where the surgeon is working on their

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,920
patient and

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,279
in that moment if something goes wrong

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,720
there are alarms that are sounding

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
there's alarms that are blaring

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
and the surgeon has to shoot their

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,880
vision over to a digital display

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
absorb the information make sense of it

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,120
in their head

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,279
come back to the exact same place that

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,720
they were once working find that place

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,880
and resume

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
and maybe that might be a split second

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,279
it's not even 10 seconds it's a split

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,199
second

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,040
and it's millimeters of a difference and

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,600
if the surgeon is not in control

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,440
they could lose a life and so in this

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,199
high-stakes scenario

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,600
the team had originally tested with a

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,680
group of surgeons in the operating room

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,360
and they quickly discovered that google

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
glass would give the surgeons this

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,079
experience

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,760
of not having to look away from their

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,279
patient to get vitals

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,440
now this was groundbreaking and the

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,440
surgeons had this huge gut reaction

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,480
to the impact that this creation could

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
have and they said

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,920
you mean i don't have to look away for

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,639
my patient to get vitals

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,279
because that had never happened before

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,279
so

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,440
in our work in prototype thinking we're

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,920
always looking for that magic moment

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,240
and our theory is that well if it's so

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,199
elusive and it's so valuable how do we

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,600
find it

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,720
can we engineer it can we try enough

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,880
options so that

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,279
one of them at least one of the options

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,079
becomes the obvious magic moment

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,199
and that is the case so we believe that

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,160
a product or service

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,279
is a magic moment and everything else is

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,600
designed to help

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,440
the customer get there it's designed to

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
help the user get to that moment as

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,560
quickly as possible

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,079
and everything else is a distraction so

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,680
you just want to clear out the way for

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,839
that magic moment

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,920
now in the course of giving this talk

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,920
and giving workshops of this nature

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,560
to thousands of people all around the

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,480
world i have asked this question

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,240
to every single person and i'd love to

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
ask this question of you

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
so in the example of a magic moment i

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,800
like to ask

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,000
who here has written an uber like simple

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
question like who hasn't actually

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
written an uber

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
now think back to your very first time

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,680
when you

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,079
hailed an uber on a scale of one to ten

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,880
how

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,360
valuable was that experience for you 10

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,399
being

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,720
mind-blowingly awesome one being super

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,079
awful sucks would write a scathing

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,160
review about this on yelp

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,320
and five so so it's not the best thing i

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,360
ever did it's not the worst

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,959
pick your number now i should play some

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,800
jeopardy music or something like

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,000
two two okay you've got five seconds to

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
pick a number do you have it

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
perfect so personally i would rate an

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,480
uber a nine

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,920
out of a sk on a scale of ten now i want

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,680
you to think about a cab

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,600
what is a cab for you on a scale of one

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
to ten and i'll give you a couple of

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,639
seconds

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,639
to think about it

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,040
okay time's up so my my rating of a cab

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,880
would be two or three maybe three

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,039
definitely a two on a rainy day and

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,559
especially after 10 p.m on granville

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,919
street in vancouver which is where

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,679
everyone goes clubbing and it's this

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,199
huge party straight and everything gets

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,319
shut down and you're waiting for hours

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,079
for a cab

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,959
so for me i have scored uber a nine and

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,280
a cab of two

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,679
that is a seven point difference and the

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,520
reason why we asked this very simple

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,039
evaluation question which is you know

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,000
how valuable is something on a scale of

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,799
one to ten

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,559
is because we have discovered this

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
really cool concept it's called the

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,000
three point offset

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,520
so if you can build a product or service

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
that is three points better than the

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,840
status quo

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,120
it's something that's naturally going to

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
feel its own rapid awareness and

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,360
adoption

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,960
it's something that will spread word of

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,880
mouth people will talk about it it has

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,360
that x factor that geneseco

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
that makes it popular now in san

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
francisco i'm trying to think of some

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,919
examples

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,320
but there are some cult favorite things

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,240
like

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,240
blue bottle coffee phil's coffee there's

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,720
like all of these consumer products that

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
just

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,080
go crazy and people talk about them

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,679
you're wondering why

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
well it comes back to this concept

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,600
around a three point offset

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,200
let me give you an example so uber has

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
scored in my opinion a seven point

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,520
offset

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,440
that's one of the reasons why you have

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,320
seen so much explicit consumer growth in

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,919
their early years

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,600
and i'm not even here to promote them

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,720
politically like i don't actually

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,559
endorse or align with

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,240
uber's values but that is such a

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,400
beautiful example because almost

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,360
anywhere you go in the world people will

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
rate an uber

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,720
a three point offset and sometimes a

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,960
five or a seven or higher

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,799
now let's take another industry

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,240
something that is less sexy

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,080
let's talk about airport security so

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,799
my least favorite airport in the world

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,320
is lax second to that is sfo and going

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,080
through airport security for me

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,000
is a three or a two it's just so bad

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,919
you're standing in line for hours i

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,360
don't know why one person can be the

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,919
only person to put their shoes in the

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
bin like

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,320
why can't we be like v yvr which is in

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,600
vancouver where we have a lineup of five

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,360
people and they all come in

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,960
maybe that has changed i haven't been to

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,080
sfo in a while but

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,360
as you know airport security sucks what

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,520
about ordering comcast

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,120
what about internet cancelling internet

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,160
that's like a one for me

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,840
if you were in the business of

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,520
building the user experience for

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,080
ordering and canceling internet

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,720
and you hit four points out of ten you

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,520
would blow

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,960
people's minds now the baseline is not

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
always one it's not always four it's not

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,640
even five

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,640
there's a lot of times where the

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,360
baseline is different depending on the

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,240
industry

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,280
coke and pepsi five and a five right but

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,679
the idea here

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,600
is that if you just hit three times

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,280
create something that will spread

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,799
word of mouth and you won't have to

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,120
spend so much marketing it or

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,520
distributing it

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,559
okay ah so i've talked a lot about magic

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,520
moments you're almost at the end here

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,200
how do we find a magic moment right it's

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,080
this elusive beautiful thing

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,280
that is going to make our startup or our

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,559
business or company

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,640
succeed how do we actually find it

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,000
well finding a magic moment is about

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,440
creating something new

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,880
and creating something new is about

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,320
solving a problem that hasn't been

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,320
solved before

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,000
in a lot of ways it's about solving a

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,799
problem that humanity hasn't solved

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
before

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,960
so we can't use the same thinking that

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,520
we use to solve the other problems

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,440
because

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,600
by nature if we applied it to what we're

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
trying to do it wouldn't work because it

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,159
hasn't been done

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,559
so finding a magic moment is about

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,799
trying a million different things

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,679
you're trying a thousand things you're

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,640
testing with

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,480
30 users you're in back-to-back sprints

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,600
going through cycles and trying to get

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,880
to the moment

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
where people are really telling you and

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,240
expressing

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,159
to you what they want and a lot of times

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,080
that data is going to be messy

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,080
you're going to have data from two weeks

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,760
ago lying on some sticky notes on your

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,000
wall now they're in the trash can

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,679
you have these big post-it wall-ups you

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,799
have information in a spreadsheet

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,480
and half of the stuff that you've

00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,520
gathered contradicts what leadership

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,120
says they want

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,880
it's this big mess but what we say

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,159
is that if you can get through this big

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
elegant mess

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
and you try enough options and just one

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
thing works

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
then everything will be amazing and

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,520
beautiful

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,200
and awesome and work out so

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
in a lot of conferences you're going to

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,720
see this light bulb as being the

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,080
iconic symbol for startup stardom

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
and success and i don't think that's

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,919
true at all i think innovation

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,880
is much more like this busy beautiful

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,280
but

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,559
a messy artistic studio where you're

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,000
trying a bunch of things and you're

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
trying to cobble together all of the

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,520
different experiences

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,120
to get to the heart of what really

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,080
matters

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,679
now that might sound daunting because as

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,480
people who are successful in their

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,400
careers

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,840
and people who really care about doing a

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,400
good job we

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,440
are not designed to and i know that's

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,120
even a popular

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,559
you know thing like feel fast like

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,240
everyone says it true

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,080
we're actually here to learn so we're

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,679
here to learn as much as we can

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,360
and then we're taking that five or ten

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,200
percent that works from each try

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,559
and parlaying it into the next

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
experiment

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,039
now what we've done is we've come up

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,240
with a strategy to help you get through

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,799
that painful mess

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,559
as quickly and cheaply and as as time

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,679
sensitive as possible because we know

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,159
that everyone is

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,880
in a race against time we have deadlines

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,720
we have

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,480
startup capital we have runway that is

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,559
burning thin and we need to make sure

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,080
that we can hit traction before

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,960
all of that reaches zero so the strategy

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,039
goes like this

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,760
it's called rate-based goals and the

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,760
core idea is that we want to maximize

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,600
our personal rate of learning by

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,880
reducing the time it takes to try new

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,120
things

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,720
now let me give you an example the

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,159
majority of us will come up with a great

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,480
idea right like we think it's a great

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,720
idea run out of the gate and pursue it

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,880
and if we do that our chances of success

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,600
are about five percent

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,240
not because we had a bad idea and not

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,080
because

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,360
we're not competent smart people we're

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,679
actually really smart people

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,760
no matter how smart we are our chances

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,880
of success are at five percent because

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,559
that is the statistic of the the amount

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,159
of products that actually succeed

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,559
whether that they're successful in the

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,200
market or the startup has a great exit

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,960
it's because any given idea only has

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,000
about a five percent chance of being

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,080
the right idea but if we try

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,679
12 different variations of that original

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,480
idea our chances of success go up to 45

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,559
if we try 50 different variations our

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,080
chances of success go up to 92 and that

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,840
number is actually even higher

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,080
because our learning compounds over time

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,799
and is accretive so we are learning

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,480
fast we're learning well and our

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,320
learning curve is asymptotically

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,000
approaching 100 which means it's really

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,120
damn good

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,799
now we also know from nielsen

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,720
that there is a lot of research that

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,240
shows that you only need to test with

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,520
about five to six people

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,600
to yield 85 or one standard deviation

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
of the core information you need to even

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,039
determine

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,679
what should be in your feature set so if

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,679
you're not sure

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,120
do people want this to people understand

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,480
this will people buy it

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,799
what are the core essential features

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,640
that users want all of that can be

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,520
answered by simply testing with five to

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,640
six people

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,360
in your target demographic of users

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,799
mind blown right because we've often be

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,799
been taught through lean startup

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,400
that we should be testing through a b we

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,320
should be split testing we need to

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,000
go through volume and look at the

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,159
quantitative side

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,520
a lot of the information almost 85

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,440
percent of why

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,360
a product will fail could actually be

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,279
discovered through early testing

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,279
and without a functional prototype

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,159
through qualitative conversations

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,120
so this is amazing i would love to pause

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,360
here and ask

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,720
have you guys asked questions but i

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,400
really want to get to the end of this

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,760
i'm going to keep moving forward okay

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,080
we're almost there this is a slide

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,240
that shows the classic way that people

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,240
build ideas and projects

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
it usually takes them on average 24

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,440
weeks to go from the stage of having an

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,960
idea to building it out as a prototype

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,720
to testing it with real people and then

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,799
making adjustments

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,799
now in prototype thinking lan we like to

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,159
take this 24 week process

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,039
and compress it into three days

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,520
into an hour into an afternoon so my

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,440
goal is to show you how to get through

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,559
that build process which is also called

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,720
a learning loop

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:26,320
in record time i can't get into it too

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,200
much here because this is really an

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,640
intro talk

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,320
but if you're interested you can always

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
find me and we can get to the advanced

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,520
curriculum later

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,880
but the key thing to know about how to

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
compress that

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,039
time and space is to look at how you

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,640
were testing

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,640
do you currently make iterations during

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,200
your user test and if you're not

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
please start we use a formula for

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,840
simulation based testing

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,640
that allows us to go through multiple

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,480
micro cycles in a test and so it's

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,880
called play pause stop

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,600
it allows us to pause the test at any

00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,200
time

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,799
quickly make iterations on the fly like

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,840
we're a nascar pit crew and the car is

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,679
still running and then we make those

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,440
changes and then the car flies off

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,039
and then it allows us to make multiple

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,880
iterations during a test

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,120
so by the time we finish the test we're

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,159
already at the next evolution

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,600
of the product or service

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,240
i'm going to wrap this up with a couple

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,760
of principles the first thing

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,760
at work when you're working on your

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,960
projects is to remember

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,320
to always just go for it try it doing is

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,360
the best form of thinking

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,039
so instead of milling around your

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,559
you know your work thinking about

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,000
something for 10 years

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,760
go out and see if you can try it in the

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,679
first 10 minutes

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,960
ultimately we think that if we can't

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,640
solve a problem in 10 minutes we're

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,400
never going to sell that in 10 hours

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,039
because fundamentally we're just missing

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,960
information that lives out in the market

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,480
the next thing is don't worry so much

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
about being right or wrong

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,559
focus on how much you can learn if i

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
learn things things and

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,000
our friend over here learns 10 things

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,200
then together as a team we have learned

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,760
30 things and that

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,840
is great the next thing is don't worry

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,840
so much about profit it's not about

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,279
getting that number to go up i know you

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,880
have a lot of pressure

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,960
from your your bosses from your

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,360
investors but magic moments are about

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,520
moments of service

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,840
lastly separate your conjectures and

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,399
actuals start doing this in your

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,000
in your workplace you can say hey my

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,360
conjecture is xyz

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,120
and the actual that i learned from

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,240
testing with someone last week is abc

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,640
lastly stay close to the medium be in

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
front of

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,240
your users spend time with them i have

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,120
spent so many so many

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,159
wasted hours with people who do not get

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,480
to know their users

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,679
they build software for six months never

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,440
talking to a user

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,039
because they never see them and then

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,559
after six months the user's like

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,399
well what does this even do they don't

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,480
understand it and they're ready to x out

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,399
don't get to that place make sure you

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,039
spend a lot of time with your users

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,640
your users are your medium you guys know

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,240
this maximize the rate of learning by

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,440
reducing the time it takes to try new

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,159
things

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,039
be concrete and specific but do not be

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,520
afraid to guess

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,799
that is huge we are always concrete and

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,600
we are always specific

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,640
we are never abstract or ambiguous about

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,559
what we're doing

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,399
because it allows us to get higher

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,320
fidelity feedback

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,440
and then the last thing is nail it

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,279
before you scale it

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,880
by definition when you scale something

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,720
that means the model has been proven to

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,320
work from end to end

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
now if you can't make it work for one

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,159
person do not try to solve it for the

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,679
10th customer or the millionth customer

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,520
because at that point you don't know how

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,000
to make it generalized yet

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,799
so solve the experience end to end for

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,080
one person

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,000
then try to solve for the second

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,320
customer the third the fourth and the

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,960
fifth and incrementally get to the tenth

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,840
so hopefully one day you can look up and

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,360
100 million people are using your

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,679
product i hope you had

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,559
a great time learning prototype thinking

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,399
thank you for

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,480
sitting here for 30 minutes learning

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,640
this approach i'd love to hear your

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,360
thoughts your reflections your feedback

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,679
you can reach me on the interwebs i'm at

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,120
prototypethinking.io

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,360
and you can email me at olivia at

00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,840
prototypethinking.io

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,840
before you go i want to let you know

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,559
that i created a little bundle of things

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,120
for you

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,399
so i will be sending out a link and in

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,240
this link you'll get a copy to the

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,320
slides so hopefully you weren't like

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,480
crazily trying to take screenshots of me

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,159
speaking you'll get a copy of the slides

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,760
you'll also get a free guide to

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,279
prototype thinking that really hasn't

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,840
been released anywhere

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,760
and you'll also get a link to an example

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,520
user test so you can see what playplus

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,039
stop looks like

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,440
i had a great time with you guys thank

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,919
you so much take care everyone we'll see

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,919
