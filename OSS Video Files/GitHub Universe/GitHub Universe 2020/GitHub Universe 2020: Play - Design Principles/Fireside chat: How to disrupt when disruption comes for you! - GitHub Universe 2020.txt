[Music]

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,000
well

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,920
thank you chris for joining me i'm i'm

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,440
excited to chat with you i've i've spent

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
a bunch of time kind of you know

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,559
googling you spending some time

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,920
reading kind of the notes that we've set

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,960
back and forth and the one thing that

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,800
struck me is we have

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
so many mutual friends but we our orbits

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,119
have never never

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
met which is which is always an exciting

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,080
um it's always exciting to have to meet

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,080
those people and to start having

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,480
conversations so

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,480
i think like myself you've spent a lot

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
of time around very innovative things

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,000
and and

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
also like myself you spend a lot of time

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,160
building products and doing product

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,399
design

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,360
and ostensibly we're here for github

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,280
talking about

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,760
code and development and all that fun

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,640
stuff and i want to know

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,200
in 2020 when you think about product

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,920
design

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
what is the what is the key like is

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
there one thing that you would recommend

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,399
for someone like just imagine myself a

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,840
product designer

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
what are you going to tell me in 2020

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,159
well thanks harper i'm i'm i'm really

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,560
excited to just have this chat

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,479
um i am shocked it's it's always

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,720
exciting when you find somebody in

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
you know in in orbits and then they you

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,159
know these kind of events get

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
you to pull together so really really

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,799
grateful for that

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,759
um i think you know product design

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,080
has has changed so radically over the

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,119
last 25 years and then

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,040
it hasn't in terms of uh

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,119
how that you know we're humans going

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
through a process trying to

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,040
figure it all out synthesize some

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,759
interesting things and put it all

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,759
together

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,159
um for the sake of business and

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,479
technology and users

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
i think the things that i have seen over

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,960
trying to

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,560
one do it myself for you know 25 30

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,439
years

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
and building teams and organizations

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,439
through

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,399
through that time period having the like

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,399
the the kind of personal sustainability

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,000
and energy to

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,320
to um be a product designer and product

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,759
developer i think is key because i've

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,239
seen so many people

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,039
come through the doors and and and get

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
burnt out

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,560
and not find their their way and i think

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,280
part of that is really truly finding

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,599
inspiration through every project right

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,959
and

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,680
and all projects are not a plus projects

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,920
we know we know that but you try to get

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
the a plus team and the a plus like

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,360
mindset

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,560
into that because if not we're just

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,440
going to do

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
mediocre work together and i have always

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
found

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
myself for like the you know a process

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
and mindset around

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,720
getting inspired around people and and

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,360
new technology and new business models

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,160
but

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,440
like having having an open mind um to

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,519
all of that i think is

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
is is really important regardless of

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,360
where you sit in

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,760
in that product design ecosystem like

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,000
you can't you can't do it for more than

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,040
two years without without having that

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,640
kind of mindset and approach

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,720
you mentioned people a couple times um i

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
always think that people is the most

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,159
important ingredient

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,760
um for success and

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,200
what kind of people do you look for when

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
you're looking to build a new team or

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,480
you're starting a new project how do you

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,760
how do you build that just knowing full

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,440
well that we probably are working with

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
great people or what have you but every

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
team is different so so when you're

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,159
starting from zero

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,159
where do you start well i think

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,920
there's two there's two layers to that i

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,879
think one is kind of the talent

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,280
uh bringing talent into an organization

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,400
um i think i spent you know

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,760
14 15 years at ido in in a multitude of

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,720
roles and i think

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,959
among the the lessons there i i had the

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,760
privilege of being in some people roles

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,879
and some

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,439
operational roles um uh

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,120
there and you know being able to recruit

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,680
these amazing people

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,519
i think this notion of that that kind of

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,599
overlaps with the github community is

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,920
like we've we looked at t-shaped people

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,840
right

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,519
and that's that's a kind of something

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
that the business schools and others

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,159
have kind of

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,720
latched on to but t-shape is one of

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,120
these things where we demanded that

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,359
somebody have world-class talent and a

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,479
depth and then the horizontal of the t

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,800
was was kind of empathy to other

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,520
disciplines or adjacency

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,720
and being able to um sometimes like even

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,479
myself i felt like

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,040
i went to business school after being a

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,960
product designer and a psychologist

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
it's almost like a pie shaped person

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,880
like how many disciplines can you start

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
to add and i think that's what

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,040
you know we drew inspiration and

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
stealing you know the kind of the notion

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,479
of full stack

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
um from you know from the developer

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,120
communities

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,280
but t-shaped is super crucial um to

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,800
everybody has a like a world-class

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,840
credibility that they can

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
that they have and they can own on the

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,560
team

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
but you know when working in these high

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,639
performance small

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
teams you get you really have to have

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,320
more than just

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,680
empathy in order to collaborate

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,080
effectively

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,280
so that's on the talent side on the team

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,360
side

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,199
i found myself in this funny role at

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
ideo where

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,759
it was basically a team building role so

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,039
at any one time in the bay area we had

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,520
30 35 projects going on at one time

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,400
and so it's this huge tetris map of

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,800
trying to get

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,919
people at the right time on the right

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
place in the right

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,880
project and align like what's best for

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
the client what's best for the project

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,680
what's best for their personal

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,360
development so

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,039
it was one of these um uh crazy swirls

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,919
and being you know knowing that knowing

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,240
designers like

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
like we do you know we we always gave

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,520
everybody the

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,840
you know kind of a veto or we tried not

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,320
to get to that point so that people were

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,560
like really genuinely excited

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,840
they may not have never have worked for

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,280
medical device

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,280
and they wanted to work in consumer

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
electronics but you know really getting

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,360
them to understand

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,319
um that kind of like from project to

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,319
project to project

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,160
like what's what's your growth and

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,280
what's your inspiration for those i

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
think those are

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
kind of some of the personal things

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,400
around um building a team from the

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,520
ground up

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,280
that's that's actually a really

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
interesting point and i think about this

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,000
all the time what happens if you're

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
or or or either as a team member or as a

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
someone who's trying to create and

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,960
facilitate the team

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,319
what happens if you're just not into it

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,600
like you mentioned someone who wants to

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,440
build maybe consumer like pro

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
electronics but they're on a medical

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
device project

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,880
this happens to me all the time i'm a

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,080
developer and sometimes i just don't

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,080
care about what i'm coding

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,319
what happens well it depends like is it

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,720
something that i have to just get

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,160
through

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
you know i have a small company and

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,199
sometimes there's just stuff we have to

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,800
do like you have this tasks that you

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
have to do to get to the good stuff

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
but other times you know especially in

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,840
my career i think about

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,400
um you know when i was at a very very

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
large company a couple years ago and

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,240
there were things that we were tasked

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
with projects that we had that

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
i don't think a person within a mile

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,080
cared about the work

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,080
um and

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,240
it was very difficult i mean i'm not

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,000
there anymore so that's what i did

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,599
but but i but i wonder is there i mean

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,520
are there ways to

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,960
you know inspire the team especially

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,479
when you're you know ideo is such an

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,880
interesting company because

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,680
they're they do consulting largely right

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,680
they work for

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
clients and so sometimes the client is

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
probably saying i want

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,560
x and everyone knows x is probably not

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,919
the right thing

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,599
but you still have to go through these

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,319
motions to give x

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,639
like how do you balance that with these

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,800
kind of really strong first principles

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,080
that i that i'm hearing about product

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
design etc because i think that's

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,759
something that i struggle with

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,400
myself well and i think it depends on

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
where

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,440
where you are in your career but i think

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,759
really getting getting folks to

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,199
understand

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,840
and be a little bit more like nimble and

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,000
fluid

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,120
i feel i think that was one of the one

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,919
of the

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,560
cultural um things that we had that was

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,960
that was

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,319
of great value to to building teams and

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
getting um

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,520
getting into you know having consistent

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,919
inspired people

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,879
is one trying to help them figure out

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,400
why

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,479
going you know working on medical

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
devices instead of consumer electronics

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,240
was a

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,560
growth opportunity and how that how

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
how you could frame that and people were

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
constantly

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,800
building your career was your portfolio

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,320
and so i think just being able to add

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,399
these these stories

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,320
even if it's working on something way

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,039
under the hood um

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,959
right i think and that is less relevant

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,760
for where you feel like you'd want to be

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,120
going in your north star

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,360
that's just like kind of like a

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,000
leadership a leadership helping them

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,040
frame that as a growth opportunity

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,640
um and yeah i think i think that there's

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
there's there there are certainly

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,440
difficult conversations that we've had

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,440
and you know

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
encouraging people to roll off of a

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
project or

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,480
you know those kinds of things not that

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,279
that didn't happen um

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,160
and uh wasn't all um you know rosy

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,320
glasses but

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
um you know those are those are the kind

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,760
of things that i think

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
you know you build your portfolio and

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,279
you know in an organization like that

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,920
different than a department driven

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,000
tech company they're the you know you

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,360
you might get into these little

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,279
areas where you you can't see uh the

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,040
next six weeks and being able to get you

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,040
know get through that project learn

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,519
something and get onto the

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
you know back onto your north star track

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,880
um

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,000
and you know because we never really

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
knew what was going to come

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,600
in the door we had to design an

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,440
organization and talent

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,640
and and breadth to be t-shaped and great

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
at what you're doing but

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
be able to be generalizable across

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
across

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,000
industries and across client bases so

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,680
that's kind of that was just the

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,839
the trick there so um

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
and and in your career it seems that

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,320
you've spent a lot of time around

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,680
education whether it's singularity

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
university there's you know

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
and then you you seem to have this kind

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,560
of um

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,240
in just the description you just gave of

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,079
this idea of like you know

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,440
iterating and having that kind of

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,440
continuous growth

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,959
if i'm leading a team again you know

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,120
what do you think the best bet is to to

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,880
get that team to continue education to

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,519
continue to learn to continue that

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,760
growth

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
um just because you know we what 2020

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
has showed me is that

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,880
you know we can't assume anything um you

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,880
know things are constantly changing and

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
so i i always think about like how do i

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,440
inspire my team

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,680
you know whether that's a small team of

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,360
a handful of friends building a project

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,200
or whether it's the team i'm working on

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,920
you know in a very kind of commercial

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
way for

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,399
for a salary i'm always looking for

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,800
ideas on how to inspire or get that team

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,880
to

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,240
to iterate and learn what what do you do

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,640
yeah i think it was um my uh my kids

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
went

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,360
to um a nursery school um

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,720
that was uh out of out of stanford and

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,399
you know all of the great things you

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,560
learned from awesome kindergarten

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,440
teachers and preschool teachers

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,200
and i think that they they just embodied

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
you know the way that they would reframe

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,279
every conversation

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,000
it was it was like the the growth

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,480
mindset

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,720
was just embedded in everything they do

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,920
so you know i think i think we can

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,760
you know i i remember learning from from

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,560
teachers and nurses that just

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,959
exude this this kind of growth mindset

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,360
um

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,360
and i think that that has that triggered

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,000
something in me

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,399
um you know that started in consulting i

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,800
stayed in consulting for a long time

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,399
um and that was continuously learning i

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,040
got to learn about you know everything

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
from

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,720
you know image guided brain surgery to

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,720
branding to

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
consumer electronics and all this other

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
amazing stuff

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,720
and i think being able seeing those

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,920
opportunities outside of your day job

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,720
was really like an eye-opening thing

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,200
and whether that meant having to ask

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,600
your

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,959
ask your boss or manager about like some

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,120
flexibility

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,279
or just showing i think people are even

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
even you know you and i doing this today

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,320
like

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,839
this is something that we're gonna learn

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
and and this is why i

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,880
know i show up and and and do these

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,760
kinds of

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,800
events and experiences because i am very

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,040
inevitably learn

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,200
something or meet somebody that you know

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,639
that the the value of that experience

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,680
and continuous learning

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,519
is um uh you know you can

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,200
you can do that as a light thing you

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,240
know you can take an online course

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,279
or you can join a community

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,920
um i took it as a little bit um it took

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,120
me in some

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,200
some interesting pathways where

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,360
uh you know that that's kind of what

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,079
drew me into being a futurist

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,519
um or and and and i used to make fun

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
like i'm sure you and i have

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,800
a bunch of friends in common in that

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
community and in it

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,360
and as a product designer i used to make

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,120
fun of futurists right like paul saffo

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
and the institute of the future now paul

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
is a colleague and a really good friend

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
from

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,240
you know from the last 10 years but i

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
feel you know

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,000
like they just get to talk about the

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,560
future and not really design anything

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,079
and

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,160
you know their butt's not on the line

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,480
for del delivering something

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,360
and if they're wrong they're wrong right

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,639
um and

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,240
and really deepening that experience and

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,320
writing about it and putting your butt

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,160
on the line with with predictions

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,000
that was one of those pathways that you

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,440
know took me from continuous learning

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,399
about trying to think about

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,079
hey what's the future of sports um and

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,560
then people are like hey can you do that

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
again

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,839
but do it for this you know this topic

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,639
here and this topic over here and like

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
oh boy what

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,160
you know what that this wasn't it turned

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,160
into you know from a

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,760
continuous learning project to a hobby

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,920
to a part-time job

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,760
um so but that's that's one of those

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,680
things you know

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:05,360
you if 2020 is has shown us like the

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,760
you know being fluid and following

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
paths and doorways that we did not think

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,160
were going to be

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,440
available or even you know on the same

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,000
astral plane

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,680
um you know i think i think that

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,279
embracing that will take you in some

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,760
interesting spots it certainly has taken

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,920
me in some interesting spots

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,519
is there anything during this coveted

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,240
time that that surprised you

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,920
about the spots it brought you

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,839
yeah well so i'll tell you two things

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,920
one um

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,839
i i had the honor of of working with

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,320
some great futurists and writers

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,040
and we did a very deep um future of

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
health care and

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,560
and medicine piece for for

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,240
a hospital system and family foundation

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,000
out of buffalo new york

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,959
and um we actually predicted the

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
pandemic

00:14:52,959 --> 00:15:00,079
uh in but for 2027.

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,880
so you look at this and then realize oh

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,519
my gosh like

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,079
this like all of those pieces it was

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,639
there

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,440
it was there it's not like this should

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,399
not have come

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,000
out of left field um so i is that

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,079
surprising it was surprising

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
that i that i looked back at our report

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,720
and i was like oh my gosh we actually

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,760
put it in there

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,560
um and but it wasn't you know in in in

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,560
the end like

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,920
those are things that we should be we

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,600
should be thinking about so i was

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,639
surprised

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,839
um i was really pleasantly surprised

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,959
that the

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,360
you know the again the the the ido

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,040
alumni community is really is really a

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,160
great is a great community

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,079
um just and i and i i'd love to kind of

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,480
swim around in the github community and

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,680
see

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,839
how those relationships go

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,360
through their careers and through life

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,079
and you know they have some great

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,320
friends

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,440
um through that through that network but

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,560
there was a

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,880
um early on in the pandemic um one of

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
our

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,079
one of our friends a woman that i never

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,759
really had the chance to work with she

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,839
was in singapore and new york and i we

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,399
just never our past didn't cross

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,399
as much as i would like to um she

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,399
created this like 15-minute

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,519
inspiration stand-up um and this was

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,440
in i think in started in march and

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,000
definitely in you know in its heyday in

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,639
april

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,720
and april and may and june and everybody

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,279
would show up for 15 minutes

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,639
and the ritual the that she was kind of

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,320
prototyping but also

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:33,360
kind of using as a kind of coping

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,120
um mechanism was you could show up

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
show something inspirational there was

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,000
no doom and gloom

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,800
um we did allow for a few times where we

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,199
had you know

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,880
we're talking about like racial racial

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,600
justice and you know we're just like

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
you're also

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,120
consuming the the year of 2020

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,800
um but it was really i think it was a

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,639
great team ritual and

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,199
um she called these creative collisions

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:01,360
that's amy bonsol

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:04,880
and it's a great i think those kinds of

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,959
team rituals are really important um

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,039
and the notion that it's you know the

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
familiar stuff like a stand-up this

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,839
community

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,319
you know lives and breathes stand-ups

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,640
and and probably loves and hates them

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,640
at the same time but you know reframing

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,280
that as an inspiration stand up was such

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
a nice

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,959
pleasant surprise and people that i

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,039
hadn't worked with or in seeing their

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,400
face in five or ten years

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,079
are suddenly you're spending your

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,919
morning coffee time with

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,760
with them and and hearing about what's

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,559
insp inspiring and what's

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,440
what they see um kind of on the other

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,480
side of this

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,520
uh of of 2020 so i found that really

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,400
surprising

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,760
um and delightful in in terms of like an

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,240
instant community that

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,840
that i just you know i never knew that i

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,720
would be connected to that crew

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,200
um at the end of 2020 which is great

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,200
yeah

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,320
i i mean throughout my career community

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,880
has been

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,600
the main maybe not driver but the main

00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,039
result

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,400
you know there's always you look back

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,240
and you say oh well the thing that made

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,520
that popular was the community

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,520
um and and i i i always

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,520
think strongly about like you know what

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,600
is that what was the reason for that

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,360
community and so often it's it's like

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,799
you said it's just around you know

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,400
something sticky like being able to

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,160
spend your coffee time

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
you know just having a change of scenery

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,080
that is hopefully inspiring

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,000
inspiring um you know speaking of that

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,919
inspiration

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,559
i i think that you know this this has

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,320
been a very disruptive time

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,080
in general for all of our lives we're at

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,440
home you know many of us are not able to

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,200
see our families during the holiday

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,120
that's coming up in the united states

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,799
we have all of these kind of things that

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,120
are happening that are very

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,840
um i guess just different than 2019 2018

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,760
etc um and i i had a friend who said

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,080
that they would really love to have some

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,799
some precedented times i was like that

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
makes sense

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,240
but um i do think that there's there's a

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,240
thing like what

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,160
what do we do those of us who are are

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,280
used to being the disrupter not the

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
disrupted

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,720
like those of you who are used to being

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,080
the leaders in innovation the people who

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
are kind of on the forefront and right

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,600
now it seems that

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,480
you know life in general is is pulling

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,640
us all

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,760
towards you know something um you know

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,679
and it's i sometimes

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,200
feel that that those of us who are

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,320
who've been on the cutting edge for a

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
lot of this building really neat

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,480
technology being part of really neat

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,840
teams

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,880
you know we're being battered just as

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,799
much as as everyone else and

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,640
how do we be disruptive or how do we

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,400
bring innovation in a place where

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,919
we have unprecedented disruption in

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,280
general to all of our lives

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,880
and how do we do it safely right

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,799
yeah i was thinking about that the other

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,960
day i mean i i was actually

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:44,400
in person uh at uh at a partners

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:48,240
um uh facility and

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,400
i it's like the old the old

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,000
kind of tricks in in your innovation

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,080
toolkit like some of them you can

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
and can't do right like you can't you

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,160
know i found myself wanting to jump

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,160
up and like do this and drag the person

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,039
over there and get them to do a post-it

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,200
note and you know

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,400
just like that like even even

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,840
superficial stuff

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,520
that you know some people would think of

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,640
innovation theater just like

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,840
the basics i i was it it kind of

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,640
it pauses us in our process and tools

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,200
and i think we have to look at kind of

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,960
our

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,520
i certainly earlier this year we were

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
looking

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,520
at in some of our creative collision

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,600
conversations we were just kind of

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
musing on what are the industries that

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,200
are going to react

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,720
and then hopefully go back to normal in

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,919
june and they didn't

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,919
right um which ones are truly like

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,600
a just like really adjusting and then

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,840
which ones are really reinvented or

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,880
having to reinvent themselves

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,400
and i i those i'm still

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,280
really excited to look at who's

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
who is going to disrupt those so i think

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,679
that's like

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,640
still tbd um but i think

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,840
our tool set really needs to be

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
disrupted i think that's a great

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,280
opportunity

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,679
um i th the only things that i've really

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
um you know and and these kinds of

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,200
communities

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:16,080
are are you know by nature decentralized

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,760
open source you know open innovation i

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,720
think that those

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,000
that maybe didn't work when they're when

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,480
the power of like

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,039
everybody being in one place and closed

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,760
walls

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,080
kind of companies those they still had

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,039
the power of and the gravitas to

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,720
like you couldn't disrupt them as easily

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,559
um or at least the process and

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,919
you know some of the talent going in and

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,080
out of those organizations and i think

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,799
that that's a great opportunity

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,000
now because who cares where we live

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,280
right as long as we have

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,559
the tools now the tools i i i'm

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,840
really hoping um this community and some

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,559
some great you know some great ux around

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,000
um some of the decentralized tools and

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,039
and sharing tools you know

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,919
murals and mirror and you know i

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,679
now those were you know nice to haves

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,600
maybe you would share that with one

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,799
client or a partner

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,039
um or a small team but now they're those

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,320
are

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,640
like as critical as as uh

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,000
as email or messaging or slack or

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,520
something like that so

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,120
i think those kind of tools i'm really

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,559
i'm excited to

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,919
see where those go um yeah

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,440
yeah i i agree completely i i never used

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,720
miro i had friends that used it i never

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,919
i didn't do any of the virtual

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
whiteboarding i just was like i don't

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,520
need that like i got real whiteboards

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,840
um and even when i had real whiteboards

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,440
i wasn't really a whiteboarding type of

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,280
person i was more of let's talk through

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,320
it let's draw it on paper

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,159
so it's kind of similar stuff but those

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,480
kind of metaphors

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,799
they haven't translated perfectly for me

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,880
but other metaphors have appeared

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,159
um one thing that i've been doing a lot

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,080
of is

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,200
it's almost like you're watching a show

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,039
called work

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
where we're all on a zoom we're all on a

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,559
meet or a hangout and we're all watching

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
and it's the show and sometimes i just

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,760
lean back and i'm just like this is very

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,440
interesting i'm watching one of my

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,200
you know business partners or one of my

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,760
friends who's coding we're watching them

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,039
code

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,960
and it really is the show and it's

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,799
interactive and you can kind of guide it

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,320
so it's a little bit like where we're

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,919
you know interacting with these actors

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,799
that happen to be our co-workers or our

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,480
friends or

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,559
whomever doing these projects together

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,760
and what i find is

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,080
the interaction

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,440
seemed a little forced in the beginning

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,039
um it seems less

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,200
forced now where it's a little more

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,679
interactive it's a little more natural

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,720
but the outcome has been much more

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,320
interesting

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
because it when we were had an office i

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
would you know walk over to your cubicle

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
or walk over to your office or your

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,440
space or

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
or even you know your house and we would

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,840
talk about whatever it was

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,520
and then i would kind of leave um unless

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,000
we were parrying very deliberately but

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,440
even then

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,039
it was like this very specific thing and

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,279
this week and this what we've been doing

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,360
is

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,640
it really is like watching someone work

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,320
and so you're able to kind of like

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,159
choose your own adventure way through

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,720
this and then at the end i feel like i'd

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,880
helped

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,000
like i feel like i participated and and

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,840
i i'm i

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
find this fascinating we joke all the

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,679
time um

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,279
that really is like watching a show

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,799
where we're engaged with the characters

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,320
and i find that really funny

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,320
um what has been your your favorite part

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,840
about being stuck at home theoretically

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,760
or being in this weird

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,320
like what what value have you taken out

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
of this time

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,799
um i think aside from

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,840
being around a little bit more to see

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,400
you know my kids and you know

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,520
otherwise i would usher them off to

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,760
school or drop them off

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,600
at school and be home at six and you

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,440
know try to go for a bike ride or do

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,080
something myself or have to go for a

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,720
late you know

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,840
business dinner and so just seeing the

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,679
interstitials

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,799
um good bad and ugly a lot of ugly

00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,159
uh is is is some value

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,440
um i think if you know if if we wanted

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,559
to tag a future

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,679
of industry like education has got to be

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,120
at the top of the list

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,679
um and i think so many so many cracks

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,480
have been

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,880
um unmasked um and education has got to

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,360
be

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
at the top of everybody's list um you

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,840
know certainly

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,679
you know the industry i'm working in now

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,960
in food that's that you know that

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,840
certainly had its uh

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,400
had its coveted moments so um i think

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,679
those are

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
i've seen a lot of value um just in

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,320
being

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
home and having a different lens like in

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,480
the same way you were looking at the

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,279
the kind of the the social interactions

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,480
that of

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,039
of of work time um i i do find that

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
interesting

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,000
you know when you're saying that is it

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,080
kind of struck me as like one of these

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,919
old school human factors principles or

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,640
design research principles that we used

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,200
to

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,919
talk about like extreme users then you

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
know

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,440
kind of give us a window into what might

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,159
be a mainstream and all of these tools

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,840
and interactions are they were happening

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
for some extreme user

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,120
right there was somebody with a headset

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,600
on watching the show

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,880
of something go on and observing and

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,080
nudging and

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,679
now it's us now it's all of us it's

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,760
really that part it's really interesting

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,159
i'm glad you noticed that

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,039
what what um is there any technology

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,919
that you've found

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,520
for instance myself um i was kind of

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,559
starting to get into twitch

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,919
before the pandemic hit and then i spent

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,600
a lot of time i mean just watching my

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,720
friends code on twitch watching just

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,480
twitch stuff happen video games and

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,360
whatnot but what i found is i kind of

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,279
want to bring

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,600
all of the weird metaphors of twitch the

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,120
interactivity the chat that community

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,080
into all everything i do i think it's

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,279
really interesting and that's something

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,559
i think about all the time is those

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,559
metaphors i just didn't have

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,080
i just didn't understand before um is

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,360
there anything like any of these like

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,159
this new technology that you're like

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
wait a minute

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,480
i want to bring this into like my family

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,039
or i want to bring this into my everyday

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,400
yeah yeah yeah yeah careful what you uh

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,159
put on to your family

00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,960
um but you know i i i definitely predict

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,559
zoom crashing tomorrow with uh with

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,240
everybody trying to do

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,760
like like our family you know across

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,080
five time zones we're trying to figure

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,640
out how to do a thanksgiving toast

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,320
um but i think you know i'll give you a

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,120
window into some of my like the

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,360
geekiness

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,520
of um you know for myself i'm you know

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,520
i've been an athlete all my life

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,880
and i i had uh both for investment and

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,120
for curiosity been

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,480
been an early early member of zwift

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,000
which is this kind of

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,000
online cycling virtual world and

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,640
you you're on a trainer that's

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,360
programmable and you ride around the

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,000
topology of this world then you know as

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,679
immediately

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,600
you know as two people tow a line it

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,640
becomes a race and a competition

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,080
and i have been racing

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,919
i'd almost retired from bike racing um

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,440
you know with a busy life and kids and

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,559
an older and an

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,799
aging body but i've been racing my butt

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,159
off like i raced last night at 9 00 pm

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:03,200
with and i had 20 people on a team

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,120
and we were on twitch and discord and

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
all of this great stuff and you've got

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,399
three screens and

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,799
you know uh this is it and all of this

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,360
crazy stuff and it just enriches

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,640
um that moment where if you've if

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,840
anybody in the in the

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,919
that's watching this has been a bike

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,279
racer you never get to talk to teammates

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,679
because one you're breathing

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,679
so hard the wind's going you're like

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,760
trying not to ride off the road and get

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,520
killed or break a collarbone

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,120
and so you never really have as much

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,559
interaction i've like the depth of

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,840
interaction with teammates that i've

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,279
known for years

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,240
um is great it's great so i i would love

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,840
to bring

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,600
and i know obviously so many of our

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,240
colleagues are trying to bring that kind

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,279
of ar

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,360
vr into into our daily life but

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,760
even those communication tools of of

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,520
twitch and discord i'm i i think we

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,440
should work on that together around

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,520
like what are those metaphors and how do

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,520
you bring that into

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,840
into our day-to-day i mean think about

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,480
how much more fun and efficient our work

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,039
would be

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,480
if we could you know if we were engaged

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,600
in in that way so

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,080
i don't know maybe it's not for

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,880
everybody but um i would certainly get

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,360
something out of that

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,880
i'd like i love it well it does seem

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,559
that it's certainly for a lot of people

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,600
i do notice a lot of my friends whether

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,520
it's coding or video games or djing or

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,120
like you said you know athletic stuff

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,559
they're doing it on these platforms

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,399
they're using twitch they're using

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,679
discord these gaming platforms and

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,520
you know one of the things that i really

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,679
love about it is because they all have

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,279
relatively open apis you can build bots

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,880
you can build these interfaces

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,720
that create this experience that none of

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,320
us you know even expected

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,919
um and i also like to go through the

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,279
thought exercise of like what would you

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
have told yourself

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,120
you know two years ago if you would have

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,399
said hey try this out it'll it'll be fun

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
you probably would have been like no way

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,880
you serious i'm gonna go outside and you

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,399
could still go outside

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
but the community is different don't you

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,760
think yes totally

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,039
totally yeah one one last thought on a

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,200
personal nature i think

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,279
the part about approaching i kind of

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,000
approach work like an athlete

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,440
and if you've ever trained hard you

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,320
can't do intervals

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,640
and hard efforts every day and i do

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,520
think that we need to kind of

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,200
embrace the cyclical nature of of this

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,279
pandemic and

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,279
um treat ourselves like athletes and

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,279
recover as hard as we are working

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,640
because it ain't gonna work

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,080
if we're all at 120 all the time

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,919
ain't that the truth well well thank you

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,279
chris it was a pleasure to chat

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:34,640
looking forward to yeah i hope we get to

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,640
