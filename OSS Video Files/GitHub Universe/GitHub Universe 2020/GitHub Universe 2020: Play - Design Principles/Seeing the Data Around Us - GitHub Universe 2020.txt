Title: Seeing the Data Around Us - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Play - Design Principles
Description: 
	Presented by James Proctor, Data Visualization Engineer, Pitch Interactive

Visualization is a powerful tool for describing and understanding information. You're probably used to seeing these kinds of visuals accompanying news stories, or as part of tools that you use at work, or to keep track of personal information like your finances or health. It's easy to focus on the massive scale of a dataset or the dramatic quality of spectacular design, but data visualization as a process begins much more simply by asking questions, observing, and thinking critically. This session will discuss that process from start to finish: beginning with data collection, moving on to analysis and sketching, and finally creating the visualization itself.

[Music]

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,559
hi everyone

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,799
and welcome uh my name is james proctor

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,519
and this session is called seeing the

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,400
data around us

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,119
so we're looking here at a satellite

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,760
image of

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,960
the area around the github office in san

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,279
francisco um

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,359
but you know my goal here is to get us

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,640
thinking about data at a bit more of

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,840
like a human

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,160
uh first first-person kind of scale

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,920
so what we're going to do today we're

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
going to go through some introductions

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
i'll tell you a little bit about myself

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,920
and and you know where i work

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,200
and then we're going to go through data

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,719
collection where we're probably going to

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,920
spend most of our time

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
and then we're going to get into

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,199
analysis and sketching right so finding

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
patterns in that data and then finally

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,079
visualization so

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,920
like thinking about well how do we

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,440
refine sketches how do we try to get

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,640
towards a finished

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,960
product and

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,600
the goal here really is to go start to

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,760
finish through the visualization process

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,200
um because we want to think about and

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
understand that process right

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,760
more so than worrying about creating

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,960
like an amazing visual right away

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,600
um you know we wanna we wanna like

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,240
understand uh you know a pattern that we

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,880
can use

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,720
uh in the future so i'm gonna show you

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,240
an example piece that i made recently

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,320
just kind of going through these steps

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,840
did it over the weekend and you'll see

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,200
it's really simple right so i would

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,479
encourage you to do

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
something like not too complicated like

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,520
that to start with

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,439
um just because you know makes it

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,960
manageable

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,399
and it'll give you a pattern to follow

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,399
in the future so

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,799
first me i'm james proctor i'm a data

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,040
visualization

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,399
engineer at a company called pitch

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
interactive

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
and i'm also an artist and you know in

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
both of those

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
uh sort of capacities i work a lot with

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,119
software and

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,280
digital tools um and you know

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,320
i'm interested in themes but in

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,879
particular

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,800
um the built environment so things like

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,959
housing and transportation which are

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,840
really pressing issues here in the bay

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,319
area where

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
i live um you know i i think those

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,040
things are interesting because i think

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,080
they reflect our

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,280
values right um you know what sort of

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,360
things get built

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,879
for whose benefit pretty interesting

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,640
kind of tells you a lot

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,239
um so a lot of my suggestions will be

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,080
about things in the physical world and

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
public space um because that's where my

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,120
mind tends to go

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
but i would say like you know you should

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
choose topics you're interested in

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,959
right because that'll make this much

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,720
more fun for you um

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,239
another thing that kind of became a

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,360
theme in this presentation sort of

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,440
unintentionally is

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,040
covid we're going to see a few different

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,680
pieces that relate to that

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,800
um so i don't know prepare yourself uh

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,239
wasn't my intent

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
but so so pitch interactive where i work

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,599
is a studio that creates data

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,640
visualizations and

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,599
interactive experiences so we do work

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,560
across a

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,480
pretty wide range of media so you know

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
web apps and interactives

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
um are probably the thing we do most

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,040
often but

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,040
you know we've worked on physical

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,680
installations projections

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,879
pieces for print so i'm going to share a

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
few examples here

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,640
uh with you to just give you a sense for

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,159
the work um kind of where i'm

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,159
coming from so um this is a piece called

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,519
out of sight out of mind uh and it's

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,239
about drone strikes

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,120
in pakistan this is this is probably one

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,200
of the pieces we're

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
better known for uh something we would

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,879
call like a narrative visualization

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
um and we worked here with data from the

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,159
bureau of

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
investigative journalism um and the idea

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,000
was to take this thing that's

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,120
you know to you know americans often

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
feels very distant

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
and kind of intangible and we want to

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
like use choices of things like

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,599
animation

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,360
and color um in the way that we

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,280
presented it to kind of give it

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
the appropriate weight right to make

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,000
this thing sort of visible

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,599
and affecting um

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,439
another piece this one has sort of a

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,560
personal angle on it because we're based

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,480
in california

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
this is called drought monitor and it

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,000
grew out of

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,040
work we had done in print for scientific

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
american

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,359
and we were sort of interested to add a

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,240
little more to that story so

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,080
some of it's like new data um but some

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,840
of it's also this interactive

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,240
component this ability to kind of look

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,520
at particular seasons and

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,639
more detail and at a high level what the

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
story is here

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,240
is really that these extreme wet and dry

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
conditions

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,759
have become more frequent and more

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,240
volatile over time

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,680
particularly in the last few decades i

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,040
see that towards the right side of the

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,639
graph

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,479
in addition to the sort of overall

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,600
drying trend in california that

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,000
i guess you know we all know about um

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,720
this is the last example i'll show you

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
this is a

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,400
visualization of you know covid cases

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
right you've

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,800
probably seen maps like this

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,880
and the thing that makes this one a

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,520
little bit distinct is sort of its

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,560
purpose

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,400
so we created it in partnership with a

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
group called big local news they're at a

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,520
stanford university

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
and we had some support as well from the

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,039
google news initiative

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,400
and so the purpose like our goal in

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,560
creating it was

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,520
for it to be a tool for journalists so

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,960
it has

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,560
a bunch of sort of embedded

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,280
options for embedding right so that if

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,000
you have an article about a particular

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,720
area

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,840
you can sort of select kind of the level

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,280
of focus so

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,759
we've got country level in most cases

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,880
uh where we can we've got state or

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,880
province level

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
views and then within the us we can

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,600
actually go down to specific counties

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,160
um and so you know it's set up such that

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
yeah

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,960
you know you can you can have this

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,840
included in an article and just always

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,600
have

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,080
up-to-date visuals to go along with it

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,880
so you know i mentioned our format i'll

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,560
just kind of

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,800
hit those points again right data

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,080
collection analysis and sketching

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,520
and visualization and so

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,800
why are we doing it this way i'm going

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,720
to make a few references to things like

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,280
paper and pencil what's all that about

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,919
um this is adapted from a workshop that

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
i've run

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,000
in person in the past and the idea there

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,800
has typically been that you know over

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
the course of

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
uh you know day or whatever it is over

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
the course of the session

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,759
um we're going to walk through those

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,680
steps go out and collect the data

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
do the sketching create a you know

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,840
visualization

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,479
um and you know again the point is sort

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
of the same

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,160
point that i mentioned before so we want

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,479
to keep the focus on the process

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,199
and so for those in person workshops

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
generally

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,880
you know i emphasize using analog tools

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,919
because it's great to not have to debug

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
everyone's setup

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,360
and just kind of get going right away

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,919
but we're not going to do that today

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,919
because

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,560
you're doing this on your own time right

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,240
um if you're already familiar with

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,400
you know a digital tool that you want to

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
use that's great you can go for it um

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
you know i use

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,319
things like d3 and react and different

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
libraries

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,759
you know daily right um they're great

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,960
tools they're they're really wonderful

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,039
technologies

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,800
um but i would say like however you sort

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,560
of choose to approach this

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,039
um what i want to encourage you to do is

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,520
just keep that focus on process in mind

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,280
um so just you know don't get too hung

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,880
up on like what's easy or hard to do in

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,720
a particular library

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,080
um don't worry about making a visual

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,280
that's like really flashy

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,400
um you know just try to try to go

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
through this in a way where

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,759
you can think through the process and

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,360
then that will be applicable

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,160
to your next project right where maybe

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
you get a little more uh ambitious

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,599
so we're gonna start off with data

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,160
collection i sort of said this before

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,039
but we're

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,759
we're gonna spend more time on this step

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,520
um

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
because that's you know the seeing part

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,240
of seeing the data around us

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,319
and also because like a lot of technical

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,280
tutorials on data visualization

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,080
start you off with a sample data set and

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,520
that's great

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,599
like for getting out of the gate and

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
learning a new technique or something

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,319
um but we want to start with the

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,800
collection itself and the reason for

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,319
that

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,160
is right it's good to see the messiness

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
of encoding information from the world

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,680
right so the real world is

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,759
is fuzzy there's just a ton of detail

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,720
there you're not going to capture at all

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,479
you're going to have to make

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,199
judgment calls about what's important

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,199
and what counts

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
you know in terms of the story that you

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,960
want to tell

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
um this is kind of a silly example right

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
but

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,720
something that seems really simple would

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,039
be like okay i'm going to

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,039
watch people you know walk by on the

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,800
street and look out my window and

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,640
say what what are the colors of the

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,080
clothes that they're wearing right just

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,599
i think that would be pretty simple

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,039
right but say someone goes by and you're

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,560
like oh is that like a red

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,240
shirt or a mo shirt um

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,600
or like you know what if they're wearing

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
a complex pattern right

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
they got like paisley on or something

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,399
you're like okay well do i mark down the

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,399
dominant color

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,760
do patterns get their own category do

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,720
different patterns get their own

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,880
category

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,640
so again it's a little silly but like

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,120
these are good things to be

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,399
aware of because then when you do get

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,760
someone else's data set

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,680
you can approach it with that kind of

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,200
critical eye and say okay like what were

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
the sort of editorial choices that went

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,320
into this right like their methodology

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,480
like how did they choose it

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
um why you know and it's not to say that

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,279
any of that sinister right like you have

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,519
to reduce complexity

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,200
in order to you know tell an effective

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,680
story in order to kind of like make

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,880
that information manageable um but it

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,040
also you know it should be something

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,440
that you're aware of

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,040
um in terms of actually collecting the

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
data like there's all sorts of ways to

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,519
go about it

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
um again there's you know wonderful

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,800
technologies like databases and

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,640
spreadsheets and stuff

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
um but you know all tools have different

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,279
strengths and weaknesses and they often

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,279
will push you in a particular direction

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,399
so um you know i would encourage you to

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,120
kind of think about what do i want to

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,640
find out

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
and then choose a method that will work

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,839
well for that so

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,279
paper and pencil are great because

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,040
they're really flexible you're not going

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,440
to do like a big data set with them

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,200
right it'd be very time consuming but

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
you can add or drop characteristics on

00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
the fly

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,680
you can kind of make notes in the

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
margins and you can also use sort of

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,519
expressive marks or

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,200
symbols um you know you also there's

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
tally apps right so maybe you're going

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,079
to go out into the world and you just

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
want to mark down things in particular

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,200
categories

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,880
um you know that'll be well suited for

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
that but it's less flexible you won't

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,079
necessarily be able to like add

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,279
something on the fly

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,000
um other things to consider um you know

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
maybe you want to

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,399
take photos to capture those colors or

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,120
you're going to record some audio to get

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,800
levels

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,399
um you know so all sorts of different

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,680
things can work

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,920
i'm going to show a couple of examples

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,959
now of you know sort of novel methods of

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,839
data collection

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
so um this is a piece by artist kenny

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
agioma

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
and he set up this website and a phone

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,079
line that allows people to

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
call in record their voices and then

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,920
also there's a way for others to kind of

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
help

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
identify and transcribe their messages

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,480
and so

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,560
this is for a piece called accounting um

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
and so it's uh it's like a series of

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,480
voice portraits

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,519
for different u.s cities right um so i

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,079
think this is really cool

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,279
uh it's done in response to the census

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,959
right you can sort of see that

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,120
um but it's also capturing this this

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,399
more nuanced kind of personal thing that

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,480
the census does right like

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:17,440
the human voice um another sort of novel

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
example right uh this is what nicholas

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
felton calls

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,680
photo visualization so he's sort of

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,480
aggregating these photos

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,240
and the story is about how they uh you

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,720
know come together to form

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,399
patterns um so so all sorts of things

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,880
can be methods for collecting your data

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,800
right keep your options open

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,480
um and just you know i've given you a

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,760
few examples here for

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,519
things you might want to collect you

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,800
don't need to use these but just to kind

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,480
of get your mind going

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,640
um you know you might look out your

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
window and say well okay what kind of

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,079
what kind of birds do i see in the yard

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
how many how many recruits they're

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,959
trying to dig into my trash

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,639
uh you know maybe you go through your

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,200
ticket stubs there's all kinds of things

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,680
you can do

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,399
right the main recommendation i would

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,760
make here is

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,079
well sort of two things the the one is

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
choose something you're interested in um

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,800
and you know because that'll just make

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
this much more enjoyable

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,560
um if it's something you find boring you

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,320
won't want to spend time with it and

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,320
that's the second thing is that allow a

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
good chunk of time here because often

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,839
like in the process of collecting data

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,000
you might get new ideas

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,200
um you might change your mind about

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,959
what's interesting

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,480
um so you know you could go out in the

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,600
world and maybe something catches your

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,760
eye

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
that's different and so you know give

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,480
yourself that chance to like add a

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,600
dimension to your data or change your

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,399
approaches

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,959
um you know because that's fine and

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,279
it'll

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,240
be more interesting the other thing i

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,560
want to sort of stay

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,079
at this stage um are two sort of

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
disclaimers right

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,680
um and the one is we've mentioned a few

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,079
different

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,920
uh some suggestions or projects that

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,839
involve data on people

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,680
and what i would say is just like if you

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,079
are going to record data on human beings

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,600
just

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,519
be thoughtful be circumspect right

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,880
don't creep anybody out don't share

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,959
information that could put someone at

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,320
risk

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,639
just kind of consider like how would you

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,440
feel if someone was recording this data

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,880
about you and um you know the other

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,040
thing is then paint yourself

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,720
yeah be careful right so so don't put

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
yourself in a risky situation use good

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
judgment

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
um you know consider your own safety as

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,480
well

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,000
um and if you're looking for more

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,360
inspiration about things to collect a

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
really cool project that you could look

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,000
at

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,720
is this book called deer data and so

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,560
this is

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,920
something that stephanie pacific and

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
george lupi created

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,600
they're both really impressive database

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,959
practitioners but here what we're sort

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,000
of seeing is these interesting like

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,920
experimental and very

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
sort of like personal visualizations

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,240
that they created

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,160
um so the the project was that they uh

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,959
every week for a year they collected a

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,040
particular sort of

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,320
personal data about their lives and then

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
made a visualization

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,160
on like a postcard and mailed it to each

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,720
other so really really interesting

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,680
project

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,240
lots of cool ideas there um and so as i

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,880
mentioned

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,920
i went through this process myself over

00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,120
the weekend um

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,360
and i went with the paper and pencil

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,079
route but again you know do what suits

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
you

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,120
um but you probably will not be

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
surprised to learn

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
that a lot of the restaurants in my

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,519
neighborhood have added outdoor seating

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,920
recently

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,120
um and i got interested in like well how

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,399
many people are using these tables like

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,079
what does that actually look like

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,000
um so i decided to record some data

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
about that um so i went out with my

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,680
notebook and i started kind of

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,880
counting seats and how many were filled

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,600
and then i kind of realized well there's

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,399
actually other things that are

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,480
interesting about this

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,079
like um like where are those seats so

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
like are they right on the sidewalk or

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,199
are they in

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,399
apartment or an existing like patio

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,519
space or something

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,120
and i played with a few different ways

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,760
of recording that as well so you can see

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
there's like

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,199
some little pictograms um there's labels

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,199
and counts

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,880
um and i sort of also brought little

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,160
notes to myself like stuff i wasn't sure

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,600
how to deal with

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,800
um so you know ideally at this point

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,680
we're gonna move on to analysis and

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
sketching and

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,880
you know so hopefully you've gone out

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,120
you've collected some data um

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
so like now the thing to say is well

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,680
what does it say

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,600
what's interesting about it how do you

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,199
want to present that story

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
um and so you know one of the first

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,760
things you can look at is like did what

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
you record

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,600
match your expectations so this will you

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,279
know maybe sounds a little familiar from

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,880
science class or something like

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,720
you went in with a rough hypothesis

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
probably about what you might find

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,000
um and if you did it's like well did it

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,160
pan out or you know

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,760
is there something surprising there um

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,199
the other big thing to look for is

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,720
patterns right so

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,240
maybe you're counting how many people

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
are walking down different streets

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,360
um and you notice oh there's more people

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,800
on this one uh

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
that one's sunny oh it's because it's

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,240
warmer right um

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
so you know think about oh is there like

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,440
a story that explains this

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
um another thing that might happen is

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,519
you realize you don't actually have

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,440
enough information

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,959
and you know maybe there's other

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,279
questions that you have

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,959
or uh pieces of context that would like

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,519
help you better understand what it is

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,000
you saw

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
and so you know that that can be a cause

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,399
to like go back and gather some more

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,920
information

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,440
uh or maybe you want to pose that

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,839
question um in your in your sketches

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,519
so if group sketching analysis together

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
um because they really are linked right

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
often

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,600
trying a way of presenting something

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,160
will help you see a pattern that you

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,399
didn't perform

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,920
and so there's all sorts of ways to to

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,079
sort of encode your data as well

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
um so these are obviously not

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,600
comprehensive examples but

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,959
just you know keep in mind you know

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
color can be used for all sorts of

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,720
things

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,560
um you can use shapes symbols uh

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,000
locations right like on a map or within

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,040
like a scatter plot

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,560
line weight um and then you know there's

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,399
also different kinds of values you can

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,040
show right you can show raw accounts you

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,279
can show

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,399
the share of a hole that something

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,920
contributes

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,920
um you know and sort of other ways of

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,279
comparing categories uh and then there's

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,560
there's lots of different chart types

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,880
we'll we'll talk a little bit more about

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,480
this in a minute but you know

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
often different chart types are well

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,360
suited to different kinds of data but

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,160
there's a huge variety of them

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,279
right so good to know sort of what your

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,800
options are

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,079
but um before we get into that i'm just

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
i just want to show you a couple of

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,519
sketches that i made right so we're back

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
to the example project we're looking at

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,199
outdoor dining

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,639
um and i made a few different ones here

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,079
and you know really the

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,000
the big thing to take away from this is

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,679
just like

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,280
again the process right so so i'm not

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,880
getting too hung up uh

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
here as you can definitely tell i'm like

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,120
making the lines clean

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,160
um the scale is way off but you know

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,959
what i'm trying to figure out is like

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,640
well

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,240
what's interesting about this what's

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
going to be useful to include

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,600
and like how do these elements sit

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,720
together in context so

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,720
you know kind of iterating on that

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,559
previous one i was like well okay like

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,400
the proportion of all seats filled is

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
sort of interesting but what if we group

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,120
it by the table because then you can see

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
like well some of the tables are bigger

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,640
than others and

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,600
is that interesting um and this is also

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,039
where i sort of was like

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,799
i really think like where they are like

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,240
if they're on the sidewalk versus like a

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,440
patio or parklet like

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,039
that's interesting so i started adding

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
labels but that was kind of like an

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
afterthought so it's not

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,919
maybe the clearest and so i was like

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
well let's push that forward so here's

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,840
these

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,080
little pictograms where i've kind of

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,679
drawn you know okay there's like a

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,760
structure around the people or

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,120
there's a little empty chair or a little

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,440
person sitting in it

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,880
um which is you know cool but like maybe

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
a little too complicated

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,799
so i sort of took that and simplified it

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,559
down right um this is like

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,919
kind of an abstracted version of that

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,000
you can almost think of it like looking

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,360
at the tables from above

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,280
and they're sort of just these circles

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,880
but if you do know what it is

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,799
then maybe it's a little easier to see

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,200
at a glance like okay these are occupied

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,120
and those aren't

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,480
um and you know so coming back to the

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
the chart types

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,480
um it can be really valuable at the

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,440
stage to look at other people's charts

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,000
and it's also good to have a sense for

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,320
like

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,280
what kinds of diagrams are going to be

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,480
well suited

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,720
to different kinds of data so

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,000
i'll just give a couple of examples um

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,320
you know one that you're probably

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
familiar with you think of like uh stock

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,760
performance or something like line

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,960
graphs being used to show

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,760
uh change over time right um time series

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
kind of things

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,880
um another that you might have seen is

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,080
if your if your computer's like

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,760
hard drive is full and you're trying to

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,280
be like oh like what's using all this

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,320
that might be presented as a tree map

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
because that shows like

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,679
hierarchy like the nested folders as

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,919
well as like how much

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,520
um how much of the whole they are apart

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,799
like how much they take up

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,320
and there's lots of different resources

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,679
that you can use for this kind of

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,799
information

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,160
but you know i think the link in this

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,679
slide and this will be in session

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,280
resources as well

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,919
it does a good job of giving just like a

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,240
basic overview of a wide variety of

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,559
chart types

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,440
something else to consider um is that

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,440
when you're sketching

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,120
kind of what you want to do is make it

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,000
easy and low cost

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,280
to try out a bunch of different ideas so

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
you don't want to have to spend a ton of

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,679
time

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,720
um on on a given option

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
but you want to be able to kind of

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,919
switch between things quickly so

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,000
in this case kind of what i'm showing

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,919
you here is like an exploratory tool

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
so this was like playing with different

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,400
ways of presenting

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,440
um coveted data on a map

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
and you can see it's got this like

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,160
really ugly kind of cluttered interface

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,080
because

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,679
what we're doing here is like playing

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,120
around with

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,960
different map styles and different

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,000
rendering options and so you know all

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,520
those controls are going to go away

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,120
right we're going to pick one that's the

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,559
best once we've kind of tried them all

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,960
together

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,640
and then you know all the the sort of

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,640
like less favored ones are going to get

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,760
cut up once you settle on that like core

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,720
or story and presentation style

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,120
um something else uh you might want to

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,600
do

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,960
is you know you might decide that your

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,120
data and its story

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,720
are better expressed in like a less

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,799
conventional form so maybe you want to

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,159
use things like sculpture or sound

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,919
um and the kenneth idioma who i

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,440
mentioned before has this really cool

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,320
piece called wage islands

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,320
and it visualizes where in new york city

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,640
low-wage workers can afford to rent

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,559
as topography so it's created with these

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,159
stacked acrylic sheets

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,840
where affordable places are higher and

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,280
less affordable places are lower

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,159
and to really sort of illustrate the

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,600
point he actually submerges it in water

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,440
um you know another similar example um

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,280
you might also think well you know being

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
able to get specific numerical values

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,000
might not be your first priority maybe

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,760
it's just about

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,679
um you know the general trend or

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,760
creating like a feeling or interest

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
um and then maybe you reveal details

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,720
later right so

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,159
this one's called air transform this is

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
by stephanie pozmak

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
and this is based on open air quality

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,960
data from sheffield in the uk which is

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,960
kind of known for its bad

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,120
air um and once you know what it is you

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,480
can sort of say oh i bet that spiky one

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,159
is some bad air

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,440
and you can sort of see how things

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,919
progressed over time even though you

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,039
don't

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,440
necessarily know what the values are

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,640
so you know at this point we've spent

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,159
some time with our data

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,000
we've considered some narratives and

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,520
different ways of presenting it

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,039
um and it can be tough to choose them

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,799
all your sketches right but often a

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,919
particular direction will start to stand

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,159
out as

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,919
more interesting and this doesn't

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,640
necessarily mean throwing out your other

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,840
ideas

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
you might also want to go with like a

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,240
synthesis of a few different approaches

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,000
um but it is best to choose sort of a

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,280
core narrative of some kind

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,760
um because that can help you make other

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,440
choices like what tools you want to use

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,799
um so like if you're going with a map

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,400
you might say okay well i'm going to you

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,960
know use mapbox or leaflet

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
or um if you want to do like simulation

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
or have lots of particles well maybe

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,039
then you say okay i want to use

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,679
something performant like open

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,520
frameworks or webgl you know pixie or

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,159
deckjail things like that

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,159
um and so so here's the you know the

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,440
final visualization that i created

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,880
um and so it's definitely you know it's

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,679
not the most impressive piece i'm gonna

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,080
show you today

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,880
right um but you can see like kind of

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,640
how it

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,919
how it's a progression from the sketches

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,280
right it's a bit more polished it's a

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,039
little easier to read i

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,960
i broke out the ruler for a couple of

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,480
things here um

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,400
and you know hopefully this also feels

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,600
like sort of an achievable target right

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,200
if you're doing this over the course of

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,919
an afternoon or something

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,559
um and you know so what to focus on here

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,240
is like

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,840
how this pulls ideas from a few of the

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,400
different sketches i kind of took those

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,200
like

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,320
abstracted top-down chairs um but then i

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,919
was also like well that's

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,520
not enough on its own we need to have

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,600
these groupings by

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,360
you know parklet or patio and we also

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,080
need labels and annotations for the

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,720
account

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,440
um just to kind of give it more context

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,919
so

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,280
um you know another thing is like when

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,799
you're actually at that implementation

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,760
stage this is where those sort of

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,039
technical

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,600
tutorials um or you know looking at

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,640
examples uh of other people's code can

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,559
be really valuable

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,720
so um and going in with that level of

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,159
specificity is good because then

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,159
you say you're like oh i know i want to

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,559
make an animated line chart well you can

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,240
search for that specifically and that

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,400
way you avoid getting sort of steered

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,480
towards just like what's easy to do

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,679
um or you know what yeah whatever is

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
like

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,880
the common thing in the tool that you

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,480
happen to grab first

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,320
so i'm showing flowing data here this is

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
a really great site it's a good resource

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
because

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,159
they have a lot of like essays and

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,039
analysis on databases as well as

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,400
tutorials

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,840
and you know those are all things that

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,600
can be really helpful to reference as

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,960
you're refining your sketches

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,000
into a finished product a few more

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,279
examples here

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,919
kind of get you thinking um this is a

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,919
piece called

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,200
uh by monaco lobby uh she's a data

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
journalist uses this really

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,360
unique illustrative style and you know

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,120
in this example

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,760
right the point is sort of less about

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,440
perfect accuracy than kind of giving you

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,880
a sense of scale by using a familiar

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,520
metaphor so she has this kind of

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,080
mountain

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,720
right and so instead of saying oh you

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,960
know

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,760
70 000 that's just kind of really big

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,440
right

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,440
it's like hard to kind of get a sense

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,039
for that like having this this metaphor

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,120
to put numbers in context

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,159
you know is actually really harmful the

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,240
other thing you'll notice here is like

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,240
it's a pretty spare visual there's not a

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,159
lot of like extraneous stuff

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,760
and you know that's another thing that's

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,440
often a part of

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,440
going from sketch to visualization is

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
figuring out well what can you remove

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,039
like what are the most interesting parts

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,880
what are the most important parts

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,360
um uh you know i often find it really

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,360
fun

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,200
to put in controls to like filter and

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,799
manipulate your data those things can be

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,400
great to play with but

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,400
for um you know for a broad audience

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,919
um that you know may not be as familiar

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,760
with the topic and definitely isn't as

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,480
familiar with the controls that like you

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,640
built

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,240
removing options or pre-selecting the

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,679
most interesting moments and kind of

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,320
guiding your audience through that

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,320
is often more effective

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,120
so you know and that's not to say that

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,240
complexity is bad

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,679
right but but it is a place that

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,520
where it's important to get feedback

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,520
right so this

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,039
uh this is a really awesome interactive

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,600
by shirley wu

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:30,240
um it's like a visualization simulation

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,080
um you know but also like because it's

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,279
so complicated like i would say hey for

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,440
something like this like you would want

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,279
to do like play testing right like

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,039
like you would for a video game right

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,919
bring in people have them look at it

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,600
cold and see

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,520
like can they figure it out can they

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,279
follow along like

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,799
because it's sort of like proofreading

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,039
something you write

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,520
where it's really easy to bring your own

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,679
prior knowledge and assumptions

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,960
um to this visualization that you've

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,039
created so

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,480
showing it to other people ideally a

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,400
cross-section of different people

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
or like if you have a specific audience

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,360
in mind kind of

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,919
trying to find people representative of

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,720
that can be just really valuable to make

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,760
sure that you're

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,200
getting your story across in a way that

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,200
your viewer can digest

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,440
