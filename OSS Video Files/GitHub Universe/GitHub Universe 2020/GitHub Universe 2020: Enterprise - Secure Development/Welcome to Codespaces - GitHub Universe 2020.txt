hi everyone i'm bailey i'm here with

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,719
matthew and we're both product managers

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,480
on github code spaces

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,480
earlier there we announced github code

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,039
spaces at satellite and the excitement

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
from the

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,359
community was overwhelming to say the

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,640
least it was amazing just how excited

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,320
the community was

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,880
to be able to have a cloud dev

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,439
environment so you can go from a repo

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,560
on github.com to a running code space

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,600
within seconds

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,559
without any setup or configuration since

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,480
may the team has put in a ton of work in

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,760
order to really continue delivering

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,399
on that vision of cloud-based

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,200
development that feels fast and lets you

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,879
contribute projects faster than ever no

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,239
more cloning and setting it up on your

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,320
local machine

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,160
we've also added thousands of people to

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,760
the beta and received great feedback

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,440
from our early adopters

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
we're excited to share this product with

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
you so if you're just tuning in to hear

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,480
about codespaces

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,920
or maybe you just hear my voice from a

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
browser tab that you left running from

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
the keynote

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
what we're going to do today is a bit of

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,880
what's new what's coming

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
and why codespaces continues to be so

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,040
exciting

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,600
to so many people get up code spaces

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
are instant cloud developer environments

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,439
code spaces provide you with a machine

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
you can access through a browser or your

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,560
ide where you can

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,040
write run debug test commit

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,920
and push your code from which leads us

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,520
to an important question

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,560
why should anyone care there's a lot of

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
hardware out there

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,759
you're watching this on a machine that

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,640
you can potentially write code on

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,079
so what is so special about codespaces

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,479
the goal for most of us

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,159
is to write great code that ships value

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,960
to our customers the open source

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,000
community

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,000
ourselves whoever that audience is the

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,079
goal is not to spend your time doing

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,439
local dev environment management

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,280
although it can consume a lot of your

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,960
time and it may not be your job

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,479
your company might have a person or a

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,159
team where this is such a problem that

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,079
it's become their job

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,560
and hopefully you're not managing python

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,800
2.7 anymore that's been end of life

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,080
but it's just an example to say let's

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,160
write great code

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,319
and be able to write it fast writing

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,120
great code should be about doing just

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,720
that

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
and not the periphery of machine

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
management that surrounds it

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,520
code spaces are available anywhere you

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
can connect from

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,680
i don't have to worry about a machine in

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
my office or at my house who lives

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,360
it's all just available and easy to

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,480
access anywhere that i can get to a

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
browser

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,680
we have local machines that are great

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,080
for slack

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
zoom spotify and whatever other apps we

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,959
want to use

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,959
but there is something very compelling

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,280
about developing in an environment that

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,519
is consistent and managed

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,879
portable and shareable has high

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,319
reproducibility

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,519
and is accessible anywhere

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,599
we know people are excited we've added

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,440
thousands of users and received tons of

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
feedback and we're working to continue

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,560
improving the product

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,159
really with an emphasis on making it

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,800
fast so we'll continue

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,519
to expand the beta and then target a ga

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,120
in the spring

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,480
or summer period and now

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,720
i'm going to hand it over to matthew and

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:21,360
he'll walk us through a demo

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,920
thanks bailey so we're going to start

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
here

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,760
on the repo landing page and this is a

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,720
page that i

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,640
love like it's a page of so much

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,959
possibility

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,959
every new project you come across you're

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
probably starting on the repo landing

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,000
page and there's so much information

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,040
here there's so much

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,040
density of information you have the code

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,239
you have the contributors you have a

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,360
readme

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,159
there's just so much to absorb here

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,319
and again this page is like so exciting

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,920
i almost get nostalgic for it talking

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,680
about it thinking about

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,840
learning a new language the first time i

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,360
came across a really exciting project or

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
or something i potentially want to pull

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,360
into a project i'm working on and i get

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,799
to the repo landing page

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,000
it's just so exciting to come here and

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,480
want to explore this

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
project maybe it's my first day on a new

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,040
team

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,040
and this is kind of my first exposure to

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,160
the project the code

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,639
the readme how it works

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,840
my only problem is like sometimes this

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,400
page can feel

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,160
a little bit like a wall it can feel

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,040
overwhelming there is so much

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,280
information here there is a readme and

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
sometimes that read me is really dense

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,520
and explains a ton about the project

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
maybe there's a lot of configuration and

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
setup

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,440
or other times maybe the readme is

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
really shallow maybe it's just been one

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,600
or two people collaborating on a product

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,479
and they really haven't evolved it into

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,720
a really robust readme yet

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,320
and while this can sometimes feel like a

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,479
bit of a wall just because there's so

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,320
much here

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,000
what this page should really feel like

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,560
is like a door it should feel like

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,960
a door to to connect to this amazing

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,720
project you want to get started with

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
and that's really where code spaces

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,400
comes in

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,320
and the way we get to codespaces is

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,360
right from this page we can go to the

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,919
code button

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,199
and right inside this drop down we can

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,479
open this project

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,360
inside of a codespace so let's go ahead

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,080
and do that

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,280
and talk about what's happening and what

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,840
that offers us

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,960
for this project so i've created this

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,280
code space

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
i was using it pretty recently and i'm

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,680
going to jump in

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,919
and just resume an existing code space

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,759
so you'll see we connect here and we

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,639
land in

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,919
what fields and really is vs code and

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,840
it's vs code

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:47,120
in the browser and for me personally

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,720
this feels a lot like home and the

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
reason is because

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,639
i use the github dark theme and this is

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,320
using the github dark theme but if i had

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
another theme i could have that set up

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,160
and synced across my code spaces

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,960
as well you can see i have my custom

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,800
bash prompt here and my dot files are

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
synced over automatically

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,919
so i really have everything that makes

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,000
this feel like i'm developing locally

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,919
you'll even see there are some

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
extensions that aren't standard here

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,759
that don't come

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,000
automatically out of the box so i'm also

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,160
able to bring in the extensions that i'm

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,960
used to that i like to work with

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,280
and use them all inside of the browser

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,520
for this code space

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,840
so this is awesome like i have an editor

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,440
i have an editor in the cloud

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,720
it is vs code but it's it's not just an

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,759
editor right it's a

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,560
full cloud developer environment so what

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,440
that means

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,880
is we can go to the terminal here and we

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,759
can go ahead

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,280
and run our app and you'll see our app

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
ran

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
it says it's running on localhost 3000

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,840
and you'll see i got this toast that

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,919
says

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,440
my service is running on port 3000 and

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,960
it's available

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,800
so let's go ahead and open this in the

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
browser

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
so what's going to happen here is we're

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,599
going to connect to

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,080
a forwarded port from this code space

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,960
and it's going to load our app so you'll

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,680
see

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,360
i have this app called haikus for mona

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,039
and we have some of those octa-cats that

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,360
martin was just talking about

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,880
and i have little haikus that we've

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,560
written about some of these octa-cats

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
and this is really cool i'm running a

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,160
node app it has a postgres database

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
backing it

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
it's not super complex but i'm able to

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
get the full app running

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,800
with a container for my web service and

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,039
with a container for my database

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,120
i can interact with it i can do

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,000
everything i would do to build this app

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,599
locally

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,400
and that port is just forwarded on

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,639
securely to me

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,440
so let's go back and let's stop our

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,879
server

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,639
and that's pretty cool like we're able

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,400
to run our server we could see a change

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,080
we could see that update in real time

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,120
with live reload

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,360
and that's great but we also again

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,199
have vs code here so we can do more than

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,560
just run our app

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,800
we can debug our app so let's go ahead

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
and run this app with our debugger

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,639
attached

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,120
so you'll see we have the app our port

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
3000 is forwarded again

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
and what we're going to do here is let's

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,639
just set a breakpoint

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
so i'm going to create a little bit more

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,680
space here and as i said

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,280
this is a pretty basic node express app

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
and we have some endpoints that are

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,080
defined here and we have this endpoint

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,039
for

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,399
for the heart experience so i can go

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,240
ahead and heart something and like it

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,279
and the counter goes up

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,519
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,479
put a break point right here

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,080
and we can jump right back into our code

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
or our live running app

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,839
i'm going to go ahead and click this

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,200
heart button and you'll see

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,560
up here we hit our breakpoint so we can

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
jump over here

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,200
we can actually look at the stack we can

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,320
look at the request that came in here

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,519
we can step through this function this

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,240
is super powerful

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,680
i'm able to you know run a full debugger

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,880
of my app

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,080
in the browser so what i'm going to do

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,160
is i'm actually going to stop the

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,080
debugger for a second

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,800
and i think we need to talk about how

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,800
how is this working like how did we even

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
get to the point where i'm running this

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,720
this multi-container app

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,120
and debugging it and the way that works

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,040
is via this dev container so you'll see

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,360
up top i have a dev container

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,320
and then we have this json file so let's

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,680
click in here

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
and check this out so what this really

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
does

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,360
is provides an instruction set for how

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,440
to go ahead and create my code space

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,800
and what configuration i really want to

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
bring with it

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,800
so what you'll see here is we have our

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,120
app and i'm referencing a docker compose

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,880
i have some forwarded ports i'm able to

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
bring in some settings so i want to be

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,680
using

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,600
bash so that's brought in automatically

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,279
so this is really cool and it's really

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,200
powerful right because we can go and we

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,160
can check out this docker compose i just

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
referenced

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,480
and you'll see i have two services here

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,200
i have a web service

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
and that depends on my database service

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
so we'll go ahead and

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,760
collapse the web service and you can see

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,519
i have my postgres database

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,959
so when we actually go ahead and create

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,040
this code space

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,560
you have you know your web service in a

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,360
container you have your database and a

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,959
container

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,880
and then we're connected to that and

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,160
we're doing all of our development

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,680
with these containers so let's jump back

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,600
here

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,760
and let's continue to walk through this

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,440
dev container so we have a post create

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,959
command so basically i'm saying

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,360
hey when you go ahead and create my code

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,519
space i want you to do my npm install

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,560
for me then this last part is super cool

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
so i can load in extensions

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
and the great part about this again is

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,399
this is configures code this lives

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,519
in the repo so when i put these

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,240
extensions in here

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,880
for the project it means not only i get

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,760
the benefit

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,800
of having these things but my team does

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,760
so we take something like

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,640
eslint which is a tool i love to do my

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
linting

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,880
and maybe i have a style guide for my

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,560
team and i want everyone to be able to

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,279
use that same style guide

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,200
if we open it in a codespace it's

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,640
pre-loaded there it can be set up with

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,720
our style guide

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,120
so right now i haven't i think finished

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,120
configuring it so if we actually did

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:31,200
an extends here and then we did

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,760
the excellent recommended

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,120
you can go ahead and you actually see my

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,519
index file is now

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,360
raising five problems and if we went and

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,440
we went back into our terminal

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
you'll see i have a lot of assignments i

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,360
did some refactoring

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
and i have some assignments that i'm

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,720
actually not using

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,320
and they're just sitting here in the

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,200
project so i haven't really finished my

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
refactor

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
but it's things like this that eslint

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
can catch for me i can just standardize

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
this across

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,839
everyone in this project so the code

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,200
comes out really uniform i love that

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,800
so let's keep walking this file

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,200
and what you'll see inside of here is

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,880
i also have the sql tools extension and

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
this is another extension

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,959
that i love so what i'm going to do is

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,720
i'm going to demo this really fast

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,360
and what it lets me do is it lets me

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,279
connect to my postgres database

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
i can even run a query over that

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,959
postgres database

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
to see what we're looking at so we'll

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,040
connect here

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,480
and you'll see this port 5432 is our

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,480
postgres database

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,519
we'll go ahead and we'll connect and i'm

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
really given this

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,519
this empty file and what i can do here

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,440
is i can just do a select star and let's

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,560
look at all of our haikus

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,440
and we're going to run this on our

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,399
active connection and you'll see

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,320
the five haikus that we saw on here that

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,279
are from our database

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,320
are all showing up with the sql tools

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,399
extension

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,600
and i can run this query i could run a

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,560
script in this sql

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,079
in this sql tools extension this is

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,680
super powerful and this is what i

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,000
love about vs code it is so extensible

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,360
i can do so many things with the power

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
of of what's available in the

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,040
marketplace

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,760
and i can bring that into my code space

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,600
so this is super exciting

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,120
what i'm going to go ahead and do now is

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,480
i'm actually going to make a simple

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,000
change

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,839
so i'm going to get rid of this i'm

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
going to close out of these files

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,600
let's go back to our index you know

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
we're not using these so we can get rid

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,360
of those if we want

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,920
we're also getting some other things

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,760
from eslint where it's telling me

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
i have other values i'm not error

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,600
handling

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,519
uh there's a lot to to be desired with

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,000
the code that's been written so far in

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,560
terms of you know the api and endpoints

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,279
i can see at the bottom here i have i've

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,279
hard-coded

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,639
port 3000 which i probably shouldn't do

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:58,000
so let's

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,000
uh go ahead and fix that up as well

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,800
let's make this a template

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
and now i'm going to go back to my

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,320
terminal

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,040
make sure that that still prints out as

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,639
i expected i get my forwarded port

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,480
awesome everything looks great

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
and now if we wanted to we could go in

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,240
here we could

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,040
make our commits and push them to our

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,959
repo

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,839
and this is like a awesome end to end

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,920
right we started our repo landing page

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
we opened a codespace we were able to

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,880
debug we're able to run

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,199
eslint we were able to look at our

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,800
database we're able to make a change and

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,320
now we could push that back

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,240
all from the browser and this is awesome

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,040
for quick changes it's awesome for my

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,399
ipad i think ryan demoed code spaces in

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,880
the ipad and the keynote

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,399
and that's like spectacular i love to be

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,800
able to do all of these things

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,279
on the go and not worry about where the

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,160
code is living where the latest code is

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,120
the power of my local machine is not

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,519
relevant

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,720
i'm able to connect to an even more

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,240
powerful machine

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,880
in the cloud but i also like to spend

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,800
a lot of my time using vs code locally

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,639
and i want to go from vs code and

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,480
connect to my code space

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,680
and i can do just that so let's go to vs

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,199
code

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,720
and i'm actually going to go to the

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,560
remote explorer

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
and i've installed the code spaces

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,560
extension

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,880
and what i'm able to do from here is i

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,759
can connect to this code space

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,680
from vs code so what's going to happen

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,160
here is this is going to take a second

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,600
it's going to set up our connection and

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,560
then we're going to have

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,279
our entire code space in just the state

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,120
that it was

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,560
right because we're connected to that

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,680
remote machine

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,199
so you can see my changes are here and i

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,079
can go ahead and if we want to make our

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,079
commits from here

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,320
updates for live demo and go ahead and

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,480
make our changes

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
everything looks good and let's go ahead

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,360
and push them

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,360
so i'm going to go ahead and push

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,480
and now our changes are back on our repo

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
so if i go back to the web we can see

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,600
this

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,480
full end to end i'm going to use

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,360
the command line with this nifty little

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,160
trick

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,959
to go back to the repo and you'll see

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,720
updates for live demo here's our commit

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,560
you'll see that it kicked off github

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,000
actions so it's now

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,360
running my tests and we did all of this

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,240
from the code space again we started in

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,639
the web

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,000
we opened our code space we ran our app

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,079
we ran our debugger we set up eslint

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,199
we looked at everything in our sql tools

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,000
extension

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,320
we went down to the desktop connected

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
from

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,199
vs code and then we went ahead and we

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,880
pushed our changes

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,399
and we were able to kick off github

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,480
actions so

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,839
all of this just from a code space i

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,360
didn't have to do any machine

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,800
configuration it doesn't

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
matter what else is running on my

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,000
machine what is competing for resources

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,520
how much cpu or ram i have i'm able to

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,439
just do this from a code space

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,439
so i hope this demo was really

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,160
compelling and i hope this is really

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,000
exciting

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,839
to see what code spaces can do

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,839
i'm going to switch out of screen share

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,360
and i also want to plug if i may really

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,600
quickly

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,280
allison is doing a talk allison is our

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,919
teammate and it's on the developer

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,039
stream

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,840
so after this if you want to see an even

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,600
deeper dive some tips and tricks some

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,799
additional functionality i wasn't able

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,360
to cover in this

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,039
if you jump to the developer stream you

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,520
can see allison's talk

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,400
and it'll be amazing check it out over

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,799
there

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,840
um the last thing i want to do is just

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,080
say like

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,080
thank you so much one to the team that

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,799
is building this that is in discussions

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,559
now

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,559
you can just go ahead and talk to the

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,480
team in discussions like they're

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,919
they're like coding celebrities you can

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,280
you can just talk to the real people

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,679
that are building this you can talk to

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,720
