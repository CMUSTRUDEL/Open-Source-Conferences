	Presented by Maya Ross, Director of Product, Enterprise, GitHub

In this session, we are introducing the biggest ever GitHub Enterprise Server release, and a host of improvements to the GitHub Enterprise account to help you run your business securely and at scale. We'll show you how you can use GitHub Enterprise Server to manage your whole CI/CD pipeline using Actions, the number one CI solution on GitHub.com. You’ll also see how you can manage your packages, find security vulnerabilies before they hit production, and enable your developers to work on the go with GitHub’s mobile apps—for the first time ever on GitHub Enterprise Server.
