hi everyone thanks for joining us

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,679
i'm abby vollmer director of platform

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,360
policy and council at github

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,880
we're here today to talk about the value

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,640
of open source software

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,240
featuring one of our popular projects

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,400
youtube dl which has 83 000 stars

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,160
as you may be aware the github dress and

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,800
safety team recently reinstated the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,279
project

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,480
after a digital millennium copyright act

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,680
dmca

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
take down request developers build and

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,239
ship software

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,840
in a complex environment governed by

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
laws and regulations

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
github works hard to support open source

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,280
and to fight for developers

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,480
so this reality really hit home recently

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,000
with youtube dl

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,160
and we're glad we were able to reinstate

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
the project today we'll be hearing from

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,760
both maintainers and users about the

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,239
project's beneficial uses

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,520
and navigating the takedown with github

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,320
let's start by turning over to our

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,520
speakers to quickly introduce themselves

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,520
let's start with you sergey

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
thanks abby and hello everyone my name

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,920
is sergey

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
and i'm a software development engineer

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,280
and in particular core developer and

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,360
maintainer of youtube dl since 2016.

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,520
for youtube deal i mostly do coding code

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
reviews both builds releases and support

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,520
great amin would you like to go next

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,600
yeah hi i'm uh mita amin

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
a student and a core developer in

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,680
youtube dl

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
for the last five years and sometimes i

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
do contribute

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,680
in other related projects such as

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,200
multimedia libraries and players

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,200
like vlc and ffmpeg

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,720
great and gabby

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,320
hi i'm gabby i work as the head of open

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,119
source research at human rights watch

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
an international ngo that investigates

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,840
and reports on human rights abuses

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,399
around the world

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
um and you may have heard the word open

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,759
source in my job title

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
so i just wanted to clear this up that

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,720
this relates to another kind of open

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
source

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,280
which is open source information

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,360
information that's publicly available

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,400
rather than open source software and

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,480
hardware

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,959
however i use a lot of open source tools

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,959
in my work

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,120
great so first things first

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
um this question is for sergey and amin

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
i think our listeners would love to hear

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,599
what it's like to maintain a project

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,400
with so many users across

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,120
multiple continents are there any key

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
challenges

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,800
benefits or advice you'd like to share

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
let's start with sergey

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,200
um first of all i would like to briefly

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,160
describe describe what

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
actually youtube dl is about for those

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,720
who may never heard of it

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,319
basically youtube dl dl is for download

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,040
is a media downloader with lots of

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
options and

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,319
wide range of supported sites uh yes the

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
spice

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,080
despite its name it's not only for

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,560
youtube but for the most popular

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,519
media services like youtube email and so

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
on

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,720
uh as already mentioned by ib youtube

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,280
they all started back in 2006

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
by ricardo garcia admittedly gained

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
popularity quite shortly and eventually

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,560
moved development to github

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,640
in around 2010 uh since then youtube

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,040
deal continued its growth and

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,480
soon became a global collaboration with

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,640
lots of contributors

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
all around the globe and a worldwide

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,319
community of users

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
monitoring project like that is not

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,000
super hard actually but

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,680
it's a great responsibility with very

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,319
specific challenges

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,720
most of us both of such challenges came

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,360
from

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,120
the nature of youtube deal itself more

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,840
specifically it's all about a

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
never-ending

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,519
cat mouse game between youtube dl and

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,080
it's supported websites

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,799
that constantly change and so that

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,120
youtube has to constantly overtake

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,799
simply speaking because once some

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,319
websites apis changes

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,519
youtube dell has to adapt to these

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,519
changes and actually keep itself working

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
for example when something changes at

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,360
youtube sites youtube deal has to

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,360
overtake and implement fix for that

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,799
to restore that functionality that just

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,959
broke

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,880
for the most important sites like

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,079
youtube the speed of such reaction is

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
quite important

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,160
so that such breakages have to be fixed

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,240
very fast

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
you may probably notice many times when

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,960
youtube deals stops working for some

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
reason

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
uh simply updating it magically fixes

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,160
the problem but

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360
there is actually no no major happens

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,280
here but

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,080
rather someone have just written a patch

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,000
and fixed version was released

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,919
another quite important challenge is an

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,479
overall project maintenance strategy

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,479
under the limited manpower conditions

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,080
uh being quite popular youtube deal

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,800
received an enormous number of

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,160
issues and two requests to deal with so

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
there is always a compromise

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
for us on what features to fix as soon

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,560
as possible

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
and what we can delay or even not fix at

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
all

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
what changes do we merge and not to

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,360
merge

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,280
yet and so on uh reviewing the code is

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
also a little bit harder comparing to

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,280
regular software projects because

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,720
uh besides actually reviewing and

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,960
checking the code itself

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
we also have to inspect and check

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
whether the extraction algorithm is

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,759
correct

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,800
or if it's possible to do better and so

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,880
on

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,039
we also deal with answering questions

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,840
and emails and do basic support

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,440
all on our own all of this brings us to

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,680
another compromise

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,240
on how to achieve maximum productivity

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,960
keeping the quality on decent level and

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,800
minimize our efforts at the same time

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
but all these challenges eventually come

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,560
with solid experience you receive

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
that is basically the main benefit as

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
for developer

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,400
for me personally developing youtube

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,080
deal with my skills significantly

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,080
especially on the early stages of

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,240
involvement in youtube deal

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,319
it's also a great responsibility it's

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,800
also a great opportunity for me to

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,960
touch a lot of different areas like

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
media delivery internals of streaming

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
protocols

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,240
reverse reverse engineering and many

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,039
more

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
i would like i would have probably never

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,000
touched at my mind job as c passport

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,960
developer

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
so basically that's it and now world to

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,840
amin

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,840
i'm pretty sure he has a lot to it

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,160
yeah um that's a really good point about

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,600
um websites constantly evolving their

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
design and

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,759
apis and and so for tools that rely on

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
those structures like youtubedl you know

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,160
needing to keep up with those changes is

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,080
really important so

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,199
um i i agree you know your point about

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,960
it's not just magic

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,720
obviously somebody needed to make a

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
patch and and you guys work really hard

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,199
to do that

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
um i mean we'd love to hear your

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
perspective as well

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,080
for me the the challenge generally have

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,759
to do with the time constraints and

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,440
working with users first there is a

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,000
huge number of requests and

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,319
contributions and not enough time to

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,759
keep

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,880
up with all of it

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,919
besides having other things to

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,360
take care of and other projects

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,800
i'm either working on or interested

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,919
in also users tend to forget that

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
we are volunteers in the projects and

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,160
they expect us to

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,800
respond to every message fulfill every

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,840
request

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,680
and review every request and

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,039
so on but this is simply not within our

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
capability bigger requests if a code

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,319
works

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
it does not mean it has to be merged

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,440
because it needs

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,960
to meet a certain criteria

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,080
such as adhering to the project's coding

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,960
convention on another

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,080
note there are certain parts of

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,080
maintaining the code

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,840
that i may be either not interested in

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,759
or not good at things like documentation

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,199
and code reviewing so naturally i

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,560
tend to spend less time working on them

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,879
at any rate there are there have been

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,800
many positive aspects to working on the

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,639
project and also getting

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,680
supports and help from people all around

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,879
the world since uh the project was

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,320
created

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:36,080
14 years ago so i'd like to

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,519
thank everyone who helped in any way

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,000
for the benefits i got working on

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,120
youtube

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,080
here it's mainly that i got to

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,519
acquire some experience and skills in a

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,680
software developer

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,680
as well as maintaining projects

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
that's great and i think the point you

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
made about people forgetting that

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,600
maintainers are

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,720
often volunteers um really is is a

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,480
common challenge

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
uh across a lot of projects and i can

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
imagine for for this one in particular

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,839
it's so popular and you both mentioned

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,760
how much you know how many issues will

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,399
request this kind of thing you get so

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,680
um again thank you thanks everyone who's

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,560
maintaining this project especially

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,120
youtube

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,640
um gabby i'd be interested to know how

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
does human rights watch use

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,000
open source tools and then more

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,279
specifically can you tell us how human

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,279
rights watch uses youtube

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,480
absolutely um so as you can imagine we

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,360
work with a lot of sensitive data

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,120
in our research into human rights abuses

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,200
and not only the data is sensitive

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
but even the fact that we're doing this

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,880
research

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,560
can be extremely sensitive so that means

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
that we have to be extremely careful

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,040
about the tools that we use so for

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,800
instance our researchers

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
i wouldn't recommend that they would use

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,640
a closed-source

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,680
browser-based metadata viewer for

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
instance

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
where we didn't know who created it what

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,920
data is being collected

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,640
or how that data is being stored and

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,720
instead

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,320
would suggest that they use a locally

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,880
hosted exif

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,720
metadata viewer um and this is quite

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,839
similar to how i also view

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,399
video downloading software and one of

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
our key

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,079
sources of data that we rely on it are

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,399
videos

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,519
posted on social media websites and

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,279
other websites

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,800
recorded by witnesses and also

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,279
perpetrators

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,680
and in order to analyze this video we

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,120
have to download an offline copy

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
this is because the content can be

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,240
removed from platforms

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,079
without any notice really quickly

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,040
because maybe the uploader removes it

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,760
themselves

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,680
or the platform would remove it um and

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,519
also because we need an offline copy in

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,920
order to analyze it

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,200
so i go frame by frame in videos looking

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,040
for clues

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,480
and i need a locally hosted copy to do

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,600
this

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,760
and also a locally hosted copy also is

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
essential for me to apply

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,560
strategies to reduce the impact of

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,320
viewing distressing and graphic content

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,959
which really only work with an offline

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,839
copy and so because of this i use

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,360
youtube dl every day in my work i use it

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
to download content

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,959
and i use the tools functionality to

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,120
download

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,079
videos in the highest quality available

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
i use the

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,920
batch um i use i download batches of

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,240
videos

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,079
and because of security concerns there's

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,120
really no alternative

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,800
to youtube dl and because of this

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
i've also started to train other

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,800
researchers how to use it

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,680
at human rights watch um and they see

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
the real need to

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,440
learn how to use a tool like this um

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,079
because they've experienced too many

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,720
times

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,000
content being removed and we have around

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
200 researchers

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,320
based all over the world and for many

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
this is the first time they've ever used

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,160
a terminal

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,440
so it's also a really exciting entry

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,959
tool to introduce to

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,200
human rights what human rights

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,120
researchers who are completely

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,279
unfamiliar with the terminal

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
and because of this i can then introduce

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,320
other terminal based tools

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,920
um so yeah this is how we use youtube dl

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,639
every day in our work

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,560
and i just want to echo the thanks for

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,680
inviting us on this panel and also for

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,720
all the youtube dl uh contributors um

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,720
who make this possible

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,399
that's really fascinating all of the

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,600
ways that this tool in particular helps

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,160
your work and i think

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,440
um a surprise there was the the fact

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,880
that you're able to use that

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,959
teach you know the kind of the gateway

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,720
to the terminal um that's a really cool

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,279
side side uh benefit for that um

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,480
so i'm curious to know um you know i'm

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,320
sure sergey and amin

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,160
are also aware of some interesting

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,600
applications of the code so

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,600
um i'd be curious to know if you could

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,040
share beyond this one that gabby just

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
explained about how human rights watch

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,959
uses the code

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,839
are there other applications that might

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,440
be interesting to discuss

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,920
survey

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,000
well i think it's secret to know on that

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,240
youtube dl is used extensively in

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,079
various software tools as a backend

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,000
it's used for archiving and making

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,079
backups it's used for

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,079
offline watching in high quality on slow

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
connections and many many other typical

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,519
applications

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,639
uh but i'd like to mention couple of my

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,720
favorite ones

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,480
uh the first one i especially like is

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,360
using youtube deal for educational

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
purposes

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,279
for research and academic pursuits as

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,399
you might probably know lots of

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,360
researchers

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
rely on large data sets processing and

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,079
large media data set protesting in

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,800
particular

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,920
obtaining such data sets may be quite

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
challenging task

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,519
that's why many researchers uses youtube

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,720
deal as a

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,000
tool for that as it allows to automate

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
it easily

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,079
uh there were many researchers that used

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
youtube mail for that purpose ranges

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,720
from

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,240
from detection of pirated video

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
re-uploads on youtube

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,560
uh to some recent and quite relevant

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,560
researches on covet 19.

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,399
uh the real there is also another quite

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,600
interesting application of youtube deal

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,760
i would like to share

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,720
and i actually learned about it not so

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,680
long ago

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,440
i have got an email on that right right

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
after the takedown happened

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
uh i may be wrong on some details but

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,240
basically there is a special

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,560
mobile alike device for rehabilitation

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,279
of

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,000
visually impaired among other features

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,399
this device

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,160
affords uh gaining access to the

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,959
information for example

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,279
uh to listen audiobooks or listen audio

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,800
of

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,279
youtube videos so that obtaining of an

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,120
audio url by this device is powered by

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,440
youtube deal in the back end

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,160
so it's quite amazing how youtube can be

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
used in seemingly unexpected places and

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,600
how it may have a social impact and

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,360
significance even in

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,360
indirect fashion there are way way more

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,399
beneficial use of youtube dl you may

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,399
even imagine

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,199
and amin will bring some other great

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
examples for you

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,480
yeah absolutely um i would be interested

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
to hear i mean are there

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,800
those are all really great examples um i

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,279
mean are there other ones that you might

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,279
want to share

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,839
what i found interesting among the

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,880
application of youtube

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,160
is it's used in some artificial

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,600
intelligence

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,360
projects to train models for application

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,360
including

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,360
object recognition

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,600
also a really interesting application um

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,199
a great well now we've talked a bit

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,440
about the project i think uh it could be

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,399
good to shift a bit to the reinstatement

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,600
um i'd actually be interested to hear

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,759
from all of you on this one

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,199
how did you navigate the takedown um

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,560
well first let's do it sergey and

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,320
and i mean how did you navigate the

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
takedown and reversal as maintainers of

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,240
the project

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,240
uh serving

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,839
uh well once i figured out the

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,480
repository was taken down due to dmca

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,519
notice

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,800
i've sent an email to all the developers

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,040
including the former and inactive one

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,040
in order to cooperate and work out some

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,759
strategy

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,480
nobody of us dealt with dmca previously

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,480
and

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,480
moreover most of us are not even under

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,639
the u.s jurisdiction

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,000
so the most reasonable reaction at that

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,600
point was to ask

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,560
for some legal help outside and that's

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,519
how we ended up

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,680
getting in touch with cff i'm sorry but

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,000
i probably can't tell you much details

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,079
on our interaction and negotiations due

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,160
to attorney-client privilege

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,680
but we were considering many different

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,920
solutions ranging from

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,160
pursuing the contra claim to moving

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,279
development of github to some dnc

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,600
agnostic country fortunately thanks to

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,639
the collaboration of eff and github we

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
were able to stay

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,279
and to keep our development in

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,079
well-established and recognizable place

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,600
so that such outcome was almost the best

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,800
case scenario for us

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,600
great amin is there anything

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,600
you would like to add

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,760
yes after receiving the dmc

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,959
take down i thought the removal of

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,760
the code could affect not only

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,199
other parts of the ut of the but other

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,799
projects as well

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,679
so we trade to make every possible

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,480
effort

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,520
to ensure that the project would

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,360
continue

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,720
and here i want to mention eff's

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,720
help that has been crucial

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,400
especially their legal advice and i

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,679
would like to thank them

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,640
and also thank github for

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,000
reinstating the project and taking a

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,840
good direction with

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,840
their new policy

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,840
thanks yeah and i also would like eff

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,720
for working with us to better understand

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,880
the code eff

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,640
um if our listeners aren't all aware of

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,320
electronic frontier foundation

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,400
um and provide legal provides legal

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,400
advice to the maintainers here so

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,760
um well i mentioned gabby i know you're

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,799
impacted as well you mentioned use this

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,039
tool every day so

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,720
i'm curious from your perspective what

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,280
was the impact you saw following the

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,280
takedown

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,000
so for us well the tool still worked so

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,039
i think that for us the impact was just

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,880
concern

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,080
um concern for what this might mean for

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,640
the tool itself

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,080
um but also for concern for what it

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,440
might mean for the way we download

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,720
material

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,160
and also what it might mean for the

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,760
future for other tools that we rely on

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,280
in open source research we use tools

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,400
that weren't necessarily built

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,080
for the purpose of human rights research

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
and unfortunately we're super used to

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,480
them getting sunsetted

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,760
going behind paywalls uh no longer

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,320
working anymore

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,520
um however if something happened to

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,919
youtube dl

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,520
i think that would be truly devastating

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,520
for our work

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
and the reason that youtubedl is so

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,880
irreplaceable

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,160
um it's not only that it's free and open

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
source but also it's

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,360
reliable i think like sergey was saying

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,559
with the

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,400
cat and mouse game um we just couldn't

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,679
keep up with the changes that platforms

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
make to the way you can download

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,080
materials

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,080
and the fact that youtubedl has a

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,480
dedicated um

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,840
group of contributors that can keep up

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,600
with these changes

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,360
um it's something that would be

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,160
impossible for human rights or civil

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,000
society organizations or journalists

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,280
who just wouldn't have the resources or

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
technical capacity to do this

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,840
and just to give one example mnemonic an

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,039
organization

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,200
who whose project syrian archive

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,320
has saved 2 million videos from the

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,600
syrian conflict

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,600
using youtube dl and when they

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,440
went back they ran a script to check how

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,640
many of these videos were now no longer

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
on youtube

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,679
and they found that 23 of these videos

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,400
uh

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,400
have been uh permanently removed meaning

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,919
that they've been saved in this archive

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
and those those videos would have been

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,320
lost permanently um that depict

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,240
uh war crimes and crimes against

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,559
humanity uh and these would have been

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,600
lost without a tool like youtube dl

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,919
um so it's with this in mind that um

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,520
that led me and colleagues at human

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,799
rights watch

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,480
to contact eff and other companies

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,840
involved

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,679
to write something that would show

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
uh the importance of this tool for human

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,840
rights research and bring together

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,080
um every other human rights organization

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,039
we knew um that uses this tool which is

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,039
pretty much all of them

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
that's all really important to

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,400
understand and actually quite relevant

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,440
to github's policy work advocating for

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,120
developers

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,720
um it's a good lead into my last

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,320
question actually because github

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
does and will continue to take a stand

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,600
for developers but no matter what we do

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,039
to protect developer rights

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,280
we do need to work within the boundaries

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,080
of the law and in this case

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,760
the dmca rules happen to be under review

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,960
so we all have an opportunity to help

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,400
shape the landscape around

00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,919
anti-circumvention

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,520
and with that in mind given your

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,720
experience with youtube dl

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,000
and dmca question for all the panelists

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,600
uh what would your message to

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,640
policymakers be

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,640
let's start with gabby

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,400
yes um yeah thanks for this opportunity

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,400
um

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,760
for us we would say restricting access

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,120
to youtube dl

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,679
for everyone uh for any purpose

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,480
is not a proportionate response uh to

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,200
the fact that

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,120
this tool could be used in ways that may

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,520
by like violating right

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,799
um so policy makers need to consider the

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,840
impact on human rights

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,120
and other use cases um that sergey and i

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,919
mean highlighted

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,120
um so our message to policymakers uh

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,159
would be that they need to ensure that

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,200
copyright laws

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,120
don't improperly restrict rights and

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,919
eliminate key sources of evidence to

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,520
hold

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,400
rights abusers and war criminals

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,880
accountable uh copyright considerations

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,400
shouldn't trump access to justice for

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,320
human rights atrocities

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,080
so that would be our message great

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,080
um next let's hear from amin

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,919
i think for policymakers it's better to

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,960
deal with

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,240
such cases without facilitating the

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,919
disruption of

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:20,000
projects based on in confirmed

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:23,200
claims and i'm referring specifically to

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,559
the dmca law where

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,080
the subjects of the disputes

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:34,159
the code in this case is removed until

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,159
the matter is settled in court

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:42,559
that makes sense uh and sergey what

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,559
would your message to policymakers be

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,400
uh i think i'll just summarize uh i

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,799
appreciate a lot

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,760
github's efforts to stand up for

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,640
developers

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,640
as well as i highly welcome changes made

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,960
in the review process for claims based

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,640
on

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,280
dmca section 1101 and i really hope

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,559
changes made already at github sites and

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,960
potential changes

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,120
in the law itself in future will

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,120
probably make it easy for developers

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
to deal with the mca thank you so much

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,960
thanks yeah these are all really useful

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,840
perspectives for github to be able to

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,679
take forward

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,159
as we fight for developers on policy

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,080
issues and i have to say the law behind

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,000
this is all quite complicated

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,600
but our objective is to put developers

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,919
first and whether that's

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
documenting human rights abuses making

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,280
the internet more accessible

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,440
or even going beyond this particular

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,000
project learning to code

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,919
or doing security research or working on

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,360
infrastructure that powers the cloud

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,039
we're here to make sure developers can

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,080
continue to engage in global

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,600
collaboration

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,440
to maintain and improve projects that

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,640
make a difference in people's lives

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
and i think this one was a really

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,679
interesting one to focus on

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
where you know we talked about how it

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,039
started in spain many years ago and it's

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,400
you know we have people all over the

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,039
world that are maintaining and using the

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,760
project

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,960
and has all these great beneficial uses

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,400
that we've just discussed

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,559
and um you know it was really uh

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
a big moment for us to kind of see how

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,240
the community

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,679
reacted and navigated the situation um

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,440
github learned a lot too and

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,159
um i'm really appreciative that we were

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
