Title: Ship happens: shipping pull requests at scale with the merge queue - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Case Studies
Description: 
	Presented by Jack Li, Production Engineer at Shopify

At Shopify, developers merge and deploy over 400 pull requests each day to Shopify master. Two years ago, we built the merge queue as part of Shipit, an open source project, to control the thundering herd of merges and ensure ships happen quickly and safely. In this talk, Shopify will explore the design of the first iteration of the merge queue, what they've learned from that experience, and how they're evolving the merge queue to continuously scale developer productivity.
