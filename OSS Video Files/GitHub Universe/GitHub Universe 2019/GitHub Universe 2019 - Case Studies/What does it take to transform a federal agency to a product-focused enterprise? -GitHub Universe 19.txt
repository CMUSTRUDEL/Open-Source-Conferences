Title: What does it take to transform a federal agency to a product-focused enterprise? -GitHub Universe 19
Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Case Studies
Description: 
	Presented by Kelly O'Connor, Principal, Boston Consulting Group, and former Product Manager for the US Digital Service

By shifting the focus away from traditional, plan-driven “project management” (e.g., cost management, schedule management, etc.) towards a more user-driven product management approach (e.g., user research, minimum viable products, etc.), the VA has been working to create the best digital experience for Veterans and business customers. Learn how VA went about this massive cultural shift -- to making human centered design (HCD) a requirement, not a “nice to have.”

There’s no point in delivering something on-time and on-budget--if it’s the wrong thing.

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,369
so the US Department of Veterans Affairs

00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:30,099
is a very large organization with a

00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:32,739
budget request of more than 220 billion

00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:35,800
dollars and three hundred and sixty six

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:40,150
thousand employees VA is the size of a

00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,430
fortune seven or eight company VA

00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,800
provides health care services and

00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,989
benefits to 9 million veterans and their

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,199
families this includes things like

00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:57,850
education benefits home loans and burial

00:00:50,199 --> 00:01:00,850
benefits and in 2015 this was Veterans

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,190
digital experience with VA so if you

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,710
wanted to compare schools to use your GI

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,979
Bill you had to download raw data on a

00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:11,470
spreadsheet from va.gov if you wanted to

00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:14,410
find a VA facility you had to use this

00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,410
outdated map to bring up free text of

00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,300
locations for VA facilities and if you

00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,360
were a blind veteran or sight impaired

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,189
you couldn't even use this tool if you

00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,490
were a veteran trying to plot to apply

00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:29,920
for healthcare 70% of users got an error

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,040
message if you weren't using a specific

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,140
browser and version of Adobe if you did

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,630
get through you had to fill out a tabbed

00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,710
fillable PDF that took two to three

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:44,939
hours the primary way veterans interact

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:49,149
with VA digitally is through va.gov in

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,790
2015 there were 250,000 mostly static

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:55,000
pages of content not written in plain

00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:57,700
language 46 percent of those pages were

00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,430
mobile responsive and just 10% were

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,259
transactional so if you actually did get

00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,899
to a page where you could do something

00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:08,259
some of the highest demand veteran

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:11,950
features had availability of 76 percent

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:14,220
or less on the backend the release

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,079
process at VA was 90 days or more

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,090
generally and there were multiple logins

00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:22,109
with varying levels of security to

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,109
protect veteran data

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,160
so today we think there's a big

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,739
improvement in but in veteran experience

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,950
interacting with VA we still have a long

00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,470
way to go but you can see VA gov is a

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,840
modern interface it's hosted in the

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,660
cloud with much much better technical

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,489
performance its transaction based so

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,110
veterans can come and do something they

00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,140
can apply for something they can check

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,090
their status they can schedule something

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,790
you can see on the right we've launched

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,550
more than 40 products over the past four

00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,500
years so in government that's a lot this

00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,540
is this top product here is the VA

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,690
facility locator so that's that old map

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,910
so now you have a modern online map not

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,160
only with directions to VA facilities

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,440
but veterans can also see what services

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,780
are offered at different VA medical

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,420
centers which is pretty cool and this is

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,269
our GI Bill comparison tool so I'll talk

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,580
about this a little later we were also

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,489
able to reduce on the back end release

00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,489
cycles to anywhere it was more than 90

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:27,709
days now it's between one and 30 days so

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,590
some teams at VA are shipping code every

00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,750
day and we also launched a login that

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,640
meets the highest level of NIST security

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,310
requirements so it's a level of

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,060
assurance 3 which is great to protect VA

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,070
data oh and the nice thing is on the

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,820
facility locator blind and sight

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:50,859
impaired veterans can use this tool so

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,859
how did we do this in four years so

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,430
today I'm going to tell you a story

00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:01,730
about how small and powered teams worked

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,010
at VA shipping one product at a time one

00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:06,019
great product at a time and we were able

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,100
to shift the mindset of a huge

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:12,410
organization from a from a traditional

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:19,579
project management mindset to a user

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:20,750
focused product management mindset so my

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,419
name is kelly o'connor

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,479
and i worked at the VA digital service

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:28,580
team for four years my term just expired

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,530
this past august so currently i'm a

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,080
principal at Boston Consulting Group and

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,849
I also work at Georgetown and teach a

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,120
class in their product management

00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:38,229
certification program

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,479
here's a little bit about my

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:42,610
professional background and some things

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,490
I care about so I'm very passionate

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:49,000
about veteran issues my dad's a Vietnam

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,040
combat veteran 82nd airborne I try to be

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,560
a patient advocate in the opioid crisis

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,350
and I'm very excited to spread the word

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,350
and help large organizations shift from

00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,030
a project management focus to a product

00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:06,010
management focus especially in

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:08,020
government so to start my story it's

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,789
important to know what the what the heck

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,310
the digital service is so who here has

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:13,030
heard of the u.s. digital service ok

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,430
awesome

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,380
usually no one's heard of us so the

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,000
digital service is a tech startup out of

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,770
the White House so we're about a hundred

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,500
and fifty people we started under

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,590
President Obama in 2014 and we are

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,470
engineers designers and product people

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,050
from innovative startups from civic tech

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,000
organizations like Code for America from

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,070
awesome companies like Microsoft and

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Google and Apple and we come and work

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:44,110
two year tours of duty on complex

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,520
problems that's me in the middle and we

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,380
are still going strong in this

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,450
administration this is the best

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,430
professional experience I've had in my

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,289
career so if you are interested in

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,169
working on an issue you care about the

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,760
government has every issue possible come

00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:02,440
and work at the digital service and have

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,810
an immediate impact so today I want to

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,030
talk about six plays that we ran at VA

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm also going to tell you about tons of

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,300
mistakes we made so you can you

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,690
hopefully you can avoid those in your

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,900
organization's the one caveat is as I go

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,039
through the success we've had at VA

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,430
please keep in mind that our digital

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,650
service team flexed from about 25 to 30

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,560
people at any point over the past four

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,630
years so everything we did we did in

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,699
partnership with VA Career Service

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,130
colleagues and awesome partners like

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,810
github and many others so this is not

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,479
meant to be a story about how great the

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,880
digital services it's how we helped VA

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,630
shift from a project perspective to a

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,630
product perspective

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:50,680
so the first play is think big but ships

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:53,650
super small and fast so this is actually

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,880
a screenshot from our digital service

00:06:53,650 --> 00:07:00,220
strategy in 2014 so marina Martin and

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,139
three other digital service people we

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,870
literally worked out of a large closet

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,700
at VA headquarters on Vermont Avenue but

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,580
we developed this document called the

00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,820
21st century VA and it talked about how

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,190
to transform this huge organization to

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,800
improve veteran experience benefits

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,760
delivery and back-end operations when it

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,700
comes to digital

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,370
we took this document to every meeting

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,130
we went to every elevator ride we handed

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,440
it out and one day Sloan Gibson the

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,810
deputy secretary of VA read the document

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,810
he came to Marina and he said I want

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,060
that VA and I tell that story because

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,000
it's a pivotal tipping point when our

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:44,110
small team became a small empowered team

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,510
and that made all the difference so once

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,270
we had some power which was pretty fun

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,190
because you can do stuff it only takes a

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,800
few change agents to start building

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,590
momentum so these are just a few people

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,630
who really helped us digitally transform

00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,330
VA we've got drew here today who leads

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:04,840
our awesome API program he's also our

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:07,210
chief foodie at VA but I want to talk

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,979
about Curt coy so Curt's over in the

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,340
corner and he was actually the business

00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:15,550
sponsor of that GI Bill spreadsheet and

00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,160
he knew in 2015 this is a horrible

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,860
experience for for veteran students I

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,570
want to fix this so he goes out to the

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,270
private secretary you know puts a

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,550
propose he gets proposals in and the

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:31,960
most competitive proposal he receives is

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,789
for a digital product for 14 million

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,580
dollars and it would take a year to

00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:39,070
launch so what Curt decided to do is go

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,500
to marina and her team of two engineers

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:44,380
and a designer and he has testified to

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,720
this to Congress he tells he has told

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,060
Congress Marina and her team she built

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,400
something that made student veteran

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,770
experience better in one weekend over

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,330
two bottles of wine so it took us longer

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,550
than that so it was probably two or

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,290
three Sprint's but it was nowhere

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,290
near fourteen million dollars in a year

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:08,110
so now we have a small empowered team we

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,000
have some power and authority we have

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,670
some champions we've identified some

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,200
problems we know we want to solve but I

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,200
don't know if people out there who work

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,730
in large organizations if this resonates

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,180
with you but we had a decision to make

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,250
do we try to fix the big existing thing

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,560
and chip away at that or do we just

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,630
stand up a brand new small thing on the

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,000
side that lets us work the way we want

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,450
to work and there are pros and cons to

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,610
both of those just as decisions I think

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,470
we made the right decision we decided to

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,910
stand up a modern tech stack in the

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,279
cloud so we could work the way we want

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,500
it to work but think about that veteran

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,810
experience right we're sending veterans

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,670
to a brand new website called vets gov

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,529
it doesn't look like a government

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:53,920
website right it looks really weird it

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:56,769
said beta all over it so there is

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,660
definitely a downside as well but in the

00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,790
end you can see the evolution we

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,480
launched the Minimum Viable Product of

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:06,610
vets gov on Veterans Day in 2015 I think

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,329
we had two or three transactional

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:14,350
features since that time we've launched

00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:16,480
about 45 modern digital products in 2016

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,820
we had a pretty big milestone where we

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,760
launched a new logon that was more

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,490
secure that was really really hard in

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,649
terms of change management and then you

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,190
can see the evolution and what was

00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:33,399
exciting this past Veterans Day is we

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:35,170
folded in the big thing to our small

00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,529
thing on the side so we kind of

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,350
swallowed VA gov and you can see the

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:43,000
interface here it's a much more modern

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,640
better technical performing site for

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,339
veterans so it's a fun story to tell

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,110
these are just two of the 40 products

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:52,029
we've launched I'm going to talk a

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,310
little bit more about that later in the

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,260
presentation but that was the first

00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,570
place so we've got a vision we've got

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,519
some champions and we've got like a way

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,990
we can deliver we've got a modern tech

00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,520
platform where we can start shipping

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:08,290
stuff so the very first thing we had to

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,990
do at VA and I don't think this is

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,410
unique to VA I think many government

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,779
agencies

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,610
conflate these two disciplines so

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:17,319
product management is not the same

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,540
everybody in this room probably knows

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,190
this but product management is a

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,550
completely different discipline from

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,199
project management so this is funny

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,449
because if you think of some of the most

00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:30,459
innovative ubiquitous technology we use

00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:33,100
today it came out of government but if

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:35,709
you try to get a job on USAJOBS as a

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,689
product manager there are no job posting

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:40,240
so this was I searched this about a

00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:42,279
month ago you get Lifeguard but there's

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,990
thousands of project and program

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,230
managers right so this is a big root

00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:49,209
cause problem government needs engineers

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:56,199
designers and product people working in

00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:58,000
houses feds to partner with vendors so

00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:03,129
one of the ways we helped evangelize

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,379
this this idea at VA was to you know

00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:07,000
educate our colleagues both of these

00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:09,459
things are important we have to report

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,680
to Congress we have to manage cost and

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:14,290
schedule but you have to be doing both

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,060
of these so project management is all

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,910
about delivering to your plan right

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,430
delivering on time on budget watch out

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:24,009
for scope creep product management is

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,689
all about users you've solved the right

00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:31,569
problem and you've delivered something

00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:33,550
that provides value and this really

00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:35,680
resonated with VA leadership like they

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,449
got it like there's very little value in

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,350
delivering something on-time and

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:43,630
on-budget if it's the wrong thing so we

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,250
started to go out and talk to users over

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,910
the past four years we've talked to more

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,220
than 4500 individual veterans so this is

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,470
in the top corner this is Marvin this is

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,769
a Seattle homeless shelter we did tons

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,689
of card sorting with veterans in the

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:00,519
bottom corner this is a site and paired

00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:03,250
veteran did tons of work with blind

00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,990
Veterans of America and those of you at

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,449
large organizations you know when you go

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,759
out and start talking to users you start

00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:12,430
hearing about a lot of problems and you

00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,680
can't fix everything so do what Marty

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,230
Kagan says find out what makes your

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,550
users the most miserable and start there

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,550
and that's what we try to do

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:28,060
so we had a hypothesis that applying for

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,390
healthcare is making many many veterans

00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,040
very very miserable just 10% of

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:37,270
healthcare applications were coming in

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,420
online at VA so in 2015 to give you some

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:42,400
context VA received 582 thousand

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,650
applications for healthcare just 10

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,660
percent came in online what that meant

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,460
for users is they've got a call a call

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,430
center and we don't hold for hours

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,880
they've got a mail in hardcopy forms or

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,380
they've got to drive to a VA to do this

00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,620
so what we did was we launched a very

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,690
basic online form that let veterans

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,730
apply for healthcare and within nine

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:08,440
months that number went from 10% to 50%

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:11,440
so we proved that there was this pent up

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,210
demand my dad 70 years old he wants to

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,470
do stuff on his phone he wants

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:19,420
self-service so the healthcare product

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,540
became one of our foundational stories

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,000
that we would tell so this is one of my

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,970
favorite plays because I'm not technical

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,470
at all I'm an English major so I think

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:34,510
good business is about telling good

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:36,280
stories so one of the things I noticed

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,550
when I came to VA

00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,320
I was a contractor and it was very fun

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,020
to come to VA and be a fed with some

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,580
power but a lot of our vendor partners

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,400
would have these really fancy

00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,440
scoreboards and tons of KPIs and metrics

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,690
and you have to remember there's an

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,850
opportunity cost to collecting that data

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,160
you don't need dozens and dozens of

00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,960
metrics just pick a few that will help

00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,530
you prove the hypothesis or tell your

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,660
story

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:04,330
so with the healthcare product we picked

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,640
one metric we said we want to increase

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:11,350
the percentage of veterans who can apply

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,570
for healthcare online these are some of

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,450
the other metrics we've collected over

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,890
the past four years across our portfolio

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,410
this is an article that was just

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,780
featured this past Veterans Day I do

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,630
want to call out we've got 5,000 people

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,790
at VA using github so that's pretty

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:31,930
awesome not exactly sure what they're

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,210
all doing but it's pretty cool so one of

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,920
the things about telling stories

00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,040
with the digital service we have some

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,240
guiding principles and you'd be

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,420
surprised how many times this gets

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,310
articulated as we work find the truth

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,250
and tell the truth so you have to tell

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,710
true stories be transparent tell

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,020
data-driven stories but you also have to

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,720
tell human stories and show versus tell

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,810
so I want to tell the story of Dominic

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,650
who is one veteran that we worked with

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:05,140
in early 2016 so Dominic was a Navy

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,830
veteran he wrote a letter to President

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,780
Obama

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,790
he'd been in and out of homelessness he

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,940
was eligible for VA health care but he

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:15,580
was not able to apply for it

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,740
successfully so our team read the letter

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,740
and we reached out to him and he agreed

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,930
to do a user research session with us so

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,140
I'm going to show that two short videos

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:28,480
they're two minutes each and we are in

00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,250
the parking lot so Dominic was working

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:36,090
but he had to meet us on his lunch break

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:36,090
and you can see how it went

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:50,540
no I've been to va.gov a few times I

00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,589
know I've been on this website before I

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,430
don't remember any of my login

00:16:51,589 --> 00:17:01,069
information though for my help the event

00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:03,110
okay it when I when I stand in for

00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:05,150
something on here it directed me to that

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:10,549
and I just remember it popping up and

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:12,620
there being a link for it I know I've

00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:15,650
done this with finding to be a fault for

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:21,860
everything which is sometimes very

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:24,980
evening sometime not I know I go to that

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,209
tent anything so motile it's like

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,040
ridiculous

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,919
what is this what you're expected to

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,419
happen when you could come on that no no

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,870
I actually expected it to open the

00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,870
website

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,500
now this is the last time I saw this

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,150
this is how it started up where it

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,440
allowed me to be able to start down with

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:12,390
trying to enroll and again like I said I

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,010
got about halfway through it and then

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,990
all of a sudden it was how do I not

00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,980
understand this what is the terminology

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,680
that they're trying to use for this

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,880
because this doesn't make any sense

00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,680
and that's when I ended up calling the

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,480
800 number to get someone to walk with

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,100
me through it because I was like look

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,140
I'm having an issue I don't understand

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,140
what you guys are asking for and I've

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,910
seen this come up to a few times where

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:42,810
it's like you need to you need to update

00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:45,300
the PDF for it I'm like this is annoying

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,430
that you can't use whatever concrete PDF

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,890
browser that you have like if you got

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,260
Adobe the current form of Adobe you

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,910
can't open it it's the problem this is a

00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,710
huge problem because some people don't

00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,320
have the financial to upgrade their

00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,210
Adobe or to even upgrade their to a

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,060
computer that carries the current flash

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,530
drive or you know PDF reader on it and

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,010
how many times have you seen this before

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,860
I tell you last year alone I'll probably

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,500
seen this about maybe a dozen times what

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,450
did you do next I think the last time

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,030
the last five times I just went to

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:21,390
library went to library yeah did it work

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:23,100
there uh twice twice twice I had to

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,380
worth it out one of those was the same

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,330
day that I called the VA and women told

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:33,300
me after she had me on hold that they

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:35,460
couldn't help me yeah okay and then this

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,770
is the same user research session so we

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,950
also tested a very early prototype we

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,950
had

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,010
so we're gonna shift gears just a little

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,250
bit so no I want you to take a look at

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:58,760
this website and just talk to me about

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,830
your first impressions what do you

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,430
notice first this is definitely easier

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:06,020
to read a larger font okay it's very

00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,200
very much straightforward

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:12,230
which is great because the other website

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,510
is like takes you around the corner and

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:17,500
over the meadow and tries to lead you in

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:21,550
a back door that's blocked with spiky

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,960
IEDs like this is super straightforward

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,820
click to enter your name and general

00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,760
information the other site is not like

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,370
that it's like looking at like say if

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,000
they took my 214 and scanned it into the

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,140
computer

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,810
it's what looking at the other side

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:41,260
looks like so if you let's say you're

00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,760
trying to apply for health care again

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,880
can you show me how you would do that

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:51,230
using this website I mean yep yeah

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,460
extremely go through it and you can you

00:20:51,230 --> 00:21:04,520
know if you don't want to enter in all

00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:06,710
of your real information you can this is

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,680
this is super easy I have not had that

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:16,990
level of ease with a website for the

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,990
government at all this is much easier

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,120
this is a dream I'd use this over here

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:38,340
than anything the VA offers which is

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:41,910
awesome okay so that was just one user

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:46,590
research session we did of about 4,500

00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:49,830
and what was really helpful with this

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:52,560
the Dominic video we call it is we had

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,970
all that data to make the case that the

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,640
form we've got up there now is not

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:59,490
working but when we showed this to

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
secretary McDonald and Sloan Gibson and

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,820
Sloan just put his head on his desk and

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,100
he's like we have to fix this

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,370
so don't underestimate the power of

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,890
qualitative data this was also really

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,380
helpful in turning the old thing off so

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,210
you wouldn't believe how difficult it is

00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:20,100
to turn something off that doesn't work

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:21,390
so okay so this is a fun play this is

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,900
where I talk about some of the mistakes

00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,580
we made so the first thing we learned

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,220
very quickly this is a painful lesson

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,810
was that old back-end systems and manual

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,480
workarounds aren't going to scale when

00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:36,030
you're exponentially increasing usage so

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,170
don't forget we are quietly standing up

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:42,720
these new products on a site were not

00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:44,610
marketing it says beta all over it and

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,970
so on one of our first products we

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:50,550
launched that had about 62 transactions

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:53,970
a day within the first week it went to

00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:56,600
500 so that was a problem we screwed we

00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:59,190
screwed up on that but what we did was

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,990
it was really interesting because we got

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,090
a lot of pressure like take the new

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,160
thing down we will just go back to the

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,400
old thing with 60 a day that was fine

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,930
and what marina said was no we're gonna

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,640
keep it up that's a forcing function

00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:14,630
we're gonna the digital service is going

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,830
to work with you we're gonna fix it so

00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,740
this is a lesson you only have to learn

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,150
once but back-end systems old back-end

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,010
systems are a big constraint in

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,200
government when we were launching

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,540
products we did as much as we could to

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,340
optimize but sometimes you're just stuck

00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,340
with that those old back-end systems

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,630
forms are a really big part of user

00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,650
experience in government so you can see

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,370
the first form

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:44,070
VA has like 535 forms veterans can use

00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:47,370
to access benefits our first forum took

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:49,169
us five months to develop we got faster

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:54,480
and today it takes the digital service

00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:57,809
five days to launch an online forum so

00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,659
here's some topics of some of the

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:03,840
biggest mistakes we've made the first

00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:06,590
thing I'll talk about is tools so in

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,760
government I think having modern

00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,789
productive tools is one of the biggest

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,740
constraints that we face so once you get

00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:16,529
through the procurement and the security

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,620
hurdles what we learned is you can't

00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:22,350
just stand up some relatively easy tools

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,809
like slack so you have to anticipate

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,179
training and you also have to be aware

00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:30,330
of a network effect so you have to have

00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:33,120
a core of people using these tools so so

00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:35,610
new users can kind of see oh I don't use

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,770
this the way I use email so drew is one

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,049
of our first champions and trying to get

00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,350
his team to use slack and it was a ghost

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,820
town

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,309
so Drew and I would be slacking each

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,140
other messages all day and so if the

00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:48,090
tool becomes just one more thing to

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,760
check that's a problem so don't

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,740
underestimate how much training you need

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,789
and that network effect for these new

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,950
tools the second big mistake the digital

00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:01,649
service made was around handoffs so

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,899
we're a tiny team we're 25 to 30 people

00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:06,000
so it was always the plan that we would

00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:08,520
launch Minimum Viable products and then

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,870
hand them off to our VA IT counterparts

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,929
so there's 8,000 people in VA Oh int

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:18,059
supported by another 8,000 contractors

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:20,520
we did a horrible job in the in those

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:23,340
early days of anticipating the rigor of

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,470
a handoff right so that resulted in this

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,770
kind of launch and abandoned experience

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:32,309
for some users our first year so now we

00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,350
have very rigorous kind of checklists

00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:36,000
and handoff activities and we also have

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,799
integrated teams where we bring our

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,940
teammates along throughout the

00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:43,470
development of the MVP building trust

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,230
and discovery I'll talk about together

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,390
so our digital service team knows a lot

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,240
about technology and design and product

00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:53,700
what we don't know about is VA health

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,270
benefits delivery and we weren't a very

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,730
humble group in the beginning so we we

00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,440
got better at this but make sure that

00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,029
you have integrated teams that you're

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,710
bringing in experts and that you

00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:07,620
recognize there's a lot of things you

00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:11,309
don't know and the last thing I'll talk

00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,720
about is the release process so during

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:15,330
our first two years we took a very

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,279
waiver based an exception based approach

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:19,559
which was great for us so we could use

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,779
cool tools we didn't have to do all

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:23,730
those documents in the SDLC for

00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:26,610
compliance but that didn't really help

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,100
the enterprise so really taking a more

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,820
enterprise approach and kind of fixing

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,720
those blockers for the at for our

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,720
counterparts was really important

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,740
whether that's updating policies or our

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,020
next play is debunking some myths so

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,320
this is also something fun that we did

00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:49,260
especially when you have a leadership

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,450
support so these are real things that we

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,380
heard when we started working at VA so

00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,120
if any of you work in large

00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,149
organizations I'm sure there are a lot

00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,370
of misinformation you can't use github

00:26:57,149 --> 00:27:01,260
it's illegal you can't go to the cloud

00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:05,100
you can't put in an evidence bag like

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,870
none of these things are true so getting

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,399
the word out and making sure that people

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,770
have the right information is really

00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:13,230
important one of the biggest blockers on

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,600
large-scale change initiatives is this

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,980
mentality of like we've always done it

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,760
this way we've always done it this way

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:23,340
so again shifting from I have my PMP

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,649
this is how I've always worked to know

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,740
we're gonna do it differently is really

00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:31,320
important so ask why but disrupt with

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,299
purpose don't just disrupt to disrupt so

00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,279
when we started asking questions like

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:38,100
why do we need all these documents and

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,740
meetings why are we spending thousands

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,049
of dollars to get people PMP certified

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,240
it is a useless credential with

00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:47,159
delivering a great digital product and

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,559
why are we blaming security for

00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,990
everything so ask that second question

00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,640
like what specific security requirement

00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,270
is preventing us from working the way we

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,270
need to work

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,950
and this is the last play I'll talk

00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,620
about so I talked a little bit about

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:08,040
being humble have some humility and

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:10,020
don't go it alone so it's 30 people in a

00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,240
three hundred and sixty-six thousand

00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,610
person agency you have to work with

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,920
partners the digital service is

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:20,130
certainly not the only group at VA doing

00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,070
really cool and innovative stuff so you

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,660
have to find these pockets of innovation

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:29,250
partner with them help them with

00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:30,780
blockers and celebrate their success so

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,930
this is one of my favorite things that

00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:36,420
we did at VA that I hope will go on for

00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,130
a long time we started so I've talked a

00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,230
lot about top-down leadership and the

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,000
support we had but that's not enough if

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,730
you want to change a huge organization

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,500
you've got to have bottom-up support so

00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,240
we started a product management and

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,250
human centered design training program

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,040
it's old school it's an in-person

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:55,890
program we run it out of headquarters we

00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,840
can do 50 people in a class and the

00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,210
first day is a classroom day in the

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,580
classroom so we invite we're gonna cycle

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,860
all of our VA IT people through it in

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,780
addition to our business sponsors our

00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,810
procurement people and our security

00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,400
people so during the first day you sit

00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,290
in class and you learn what the heck is

00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,510
product management you learn about human

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,940
Center design and agile and Minimum

00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,680
Viable products and then we also have

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,050
leadership so we have people like drew

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,570
and our CIO and our deputy come in and

00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:28,110
actually give people permission to work

00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:30,240
this way that's really important I call

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,280
it like the Merv Griffin Show which no

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,370
one on my team gets that reference but

00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:37,410
so this picture on on the right is the

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,300
day in the classroom and then these

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,040
other two pictures the second day is

00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,870
really the secret sauce of the training

00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,420
so that's when we actually go out to the

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,510
field and talk to veterans so this is at

00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,060
the VA Medical Center in DC and we break

00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:53,040
out into small teams so we'll have small

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,710
teams at you know prosthetics and

00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,140
pharmacy and long-term care and you can

00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,640
see this picture in the middle is in the

00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,370
lobby with what I think is a pretty

00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,920
scary dangerous popcorn machine but it's

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:06,630
basically just our team talking to

00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,940
veterans and building empathy we're not

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,500
collecting requirements you're just kind

00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,310
of an empathy building and my

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:18,180
set shift activity so this is a great

00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:21,360
program we do this every month in

00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,180
addition to in-house trainings you can

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,310
do make sure to leverage external

00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:30,660
partners so this is our awesome github

00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:33,870
VA team they have trained 5000 people so

00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,490
far at VA they also teach a module in

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,070
that product management training which

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:40,380
is fantastic in addition to teaching a

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,250
module at the Georgetown program which

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,650
is really cool

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,630
so invest in the right training for your

00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,390
team I'm biased because I teach in the

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,460
Georgetown program but send your folks

00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,500
to marty Kagan's class or Harvard has a

00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,030
class but make sure you're getting them

00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,550
the right training and not the

00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,670
traditional you know deliver on time and

00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,670
on budget

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:05,040
be humble so I wanted to talk a little

00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:07,200
bit about as a product person it's easy

00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,720
to have empathy for users right that's

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,790
kind of built into the fabric of product

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,010
management but have empathy for your

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:16,410
colleagues because it's a scary thing

00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:18,000
trying to use these new tools and I

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,910
discovered that when I started at the

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,650
digital service at VA and I come from

00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,350
some pretty good companies like Gartner

00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:27,660
and Deloitte we did not work the way

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,970
engineers and designers from Microsoft

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,340
and Google and Code for America work at

00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,920
all so I came to VA equipped with my

00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,930
integrated project plan and earned value

00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,790
management and like why is no one

00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:41,910
answering my email and what the heck's a

00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:43,950
github so I think that was good for me

00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:48,390
because it helped me to develop some

00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:51,660
empathy for my VA colleagues fear is a

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:55,830
big big root cause of resistance of

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:58,740
change and then the last thing in this

00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:00,300
in this play is just be an optimist it's

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:05,460
contagious and it's going to be a force

00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:07,530
multiplier so hopefully some of those

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,090
plays and lessons learned helped you go

00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,460
back to your if you work in a large

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:14,430
organization and affect some change so

00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,890
think big but chip small and fast focus

00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:19,470
on delivery tell true stories that

00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,540
matter get smarter as you work sometimes

00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,309
that means failing in the open be a

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,910
mythbuster and have some

00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:29,180
humility thank you

00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:58,869
[Applause]

00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:58,869
