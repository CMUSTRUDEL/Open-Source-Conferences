Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Case Studies
Description: 
	Presented by Kelly O'Connor, Principal, Boston Consulting Group, and former Product Manager for the US Digital Service

By shifting the focus away from traditional, plan-driven “project management” (e.g., cost management, schedule management, etc.) towards a more user-driven product management approach (e.g., user research, minimum viable products, etc.), the VA has been working to create the best digital experience for Veterans and business customers. Learn how VA went about this massive cultural shift -- to making human centered design (HCD) a requirement, not a “nice to have.”

There’s no point in delivering something on-time and on-budget--if it’s the wrong thing.
