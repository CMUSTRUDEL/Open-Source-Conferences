Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Case Studies
Description: 
	Rumors of the mainframe's demise have been greatly exaggerated. In fact, mainframe workloads are growing in many Enterprises. Until recently mainframe tooling and development processes have been static - stuck in earlier eras. Non-mainframe developers favor Git and GitHub for their decentralized nature, collaboration, and workflow flexibility. As seasoned mainframe programmers leave the workforce many developers are being hired to enhance, modernize, and manage mainframe applications. This makes the need to provide familiar tools and processes more important than ever.

This session covers how businesses can modernize their mainframe development experience with tooling including Git, GitHub, and Jenkins, making it easier for a new generation of developers to support growing mainframe workloads.
