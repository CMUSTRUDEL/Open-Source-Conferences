Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Case Studies
Description: 
	Presented by Tim Carmean, Central Software Process & Tools Supervisor, and Tom Erickson, Global Software Tools & Processes, Ford

Ford began writing software in the 1980s using assembly on a Motorola 8065 microcontroller to implement electronic fuel injection. Today, there are dozens of Electronic Control Units controlling the features and functions of modern automobiles. Writing code that powers vehicles carries unique environmental and regulatory compliance requirements, including functional safety, emissions, and warranty. Ford is transforming the way they think about software, thanks to GitHub.

This talk will discuss the history of software engineering at Ford, some of the unique requirements and challenges faced in their systemsâ€”and how GitHub is helping them deliver the products their customers want, with the quality they demand at the speed of the modern software industry.
