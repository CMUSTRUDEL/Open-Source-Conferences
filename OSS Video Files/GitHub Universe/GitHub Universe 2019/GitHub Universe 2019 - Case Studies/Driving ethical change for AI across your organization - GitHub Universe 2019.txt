Description: 
	Presented by Andrea Gallego, CTO at BCG GAMMA Global

As AI becomes more prevalent in our workplaces, it is imperative that solutions are deployed ethically. Organizations need to be cognizant of how they collect and use data, the products they leverage, and the biases that could applied. Most importantly, we need to make sure those who develop algorithms are as diverse as the societies they serve, and that they have the ability to harness the interests and needs of their users. Andrea Gallego, CTO of BCG GAMMA, will explain how GitHub is used by GAMMA’s software and data engineers, data scientists, and analysts to check that unique perspectives and insights are curated and nurtured, and collaboration is tracked and supported across the organization—making GAMMA’s AI solutions more ethical, inclusive, and comprehensive. This talk will help you answer the question: How can we make sure the intelligence we gain from innovations is created and managed ethically?
