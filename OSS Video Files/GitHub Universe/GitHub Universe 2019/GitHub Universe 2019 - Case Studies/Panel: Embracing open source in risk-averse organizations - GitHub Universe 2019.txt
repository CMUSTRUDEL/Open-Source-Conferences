[Music]

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,029
good morning everyone thank you for

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,759
joining us this morning through a panel

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,860
on embracing open source in risk adverse

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:30,509
organizations I'm Jamie Jones I lead our

00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,690
field architecture team here at github

00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:35,940
really happy to be sort of moderating or

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,010
trying to moderate this wonderful panel

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,170
we have for us today as you've heard

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,390
throughout the last two days open source

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,269
and its value and not only the community

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,650
and security but on organization and

00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:48,660
organizations is something that's

00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,539
constantly growing one of my roles here

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,059
at github is to help organizations risk

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,680
adverse and otherwise embrace and have

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,570
success with open source so this is a

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,090
topic that's near and dear to my heart

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,460
I brought together a panel of

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,789
representatives from risk adverse is

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,630
probably the best way to describe it

00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:09,509
organizations who are also sort of

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,340
embarking on or deeply down this

00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:12,630
open-source journey I would really want

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,580
to have an opportunity for them to share

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,560
their own stories their experiences

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,090
their successes and maybe some of the

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,679
pitfalls they've had along the way of

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,479
how they've been able to sort of drive

00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:24,150
open source within their organizations

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,950
real quick even if we can see you beyond

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,409
these bright lights goodbye a show of

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,409
hands are there those who work in risk

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,420
adverse organizations heavy security

00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:35,430
compliance regulation and are maybe

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,790
still trying to do open source wonderful

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,700
so this is cool you are my people this

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,990
is super good so I want to give my

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,430
panelists an opportunity to introduce

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,070
themselves and tell you a little a

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,970
little bit about about themselves in

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,939
their organizations

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,259
John work hi I'm John Mark Walker I run

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,990
the open source program office at

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,770
Capital One you may know me from such

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,939
hits as VA Linux and SourceForge

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,880
sorry for the kids out there SourceForge

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,240
was github before get out all right and

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,030
then hi Pyrrhic and groundwork and more

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,799
recently Gluster in Red Hat I I spent

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,570
the last 20 years working on open source

00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:14,340
communities being a community manager or

00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,950
community facilitator developer

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,150
relations and about five or six years

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,970
ago I started asking myself the question

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,549
I feel like I'm good at what I do but

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,650
the central question is how much valued

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,989
is what I do actually add to the

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,489
organization for which I work how does

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,410
that translate my dollars and cents and

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,360
so as I started thinking about that

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,130
you know I start thinking about why is

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,660
it that technology vendors are

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,180
ever-present in all these open-source

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,680
communities and if we agree that so much

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,800
innovation happens in these open-source

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,810
spaces why is it that it's so heavy with

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,460
software vendors and software makers and

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,700
not some of these larger traditional

00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,860
enterprises and so that's kind of beyond

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,780
the the journey towards where I am now

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,520
at Capital One because I thought you

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,380
know be a really good chance to dive in

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,360
and figure out you know how is

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,700
open-source being used within Capital

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,440
One and companies like it and how can we

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,420
make the participation rate greater and

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,670
how can we add value and get value

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,930
because it's you know has to be a

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,640
symbiotic relationship but how do we

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,560
unlock these things and sort of work

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,530
within this risk-averse environment or

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,450
you know the the title of the panel is

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:24,510
embracing open-source we've embraced

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,670
open-source so now what the director

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,340
remembers success at finis and I'll

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,390
start Wirth first with what finis is

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,250
we're the FinTech

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,390
open-source foundation so we're an

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,950
independent non-profit 501 C 6 and

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,900
really our aim is to get financial

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,870
services institutions so large banks

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,360
hedge funds asset managers to do more

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,480
with open source so they tend to be very

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,240
large consumers of open source but not

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,780
great on the contribution side and so

00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,030
really that's why we exist we have many

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,000
large banks as our is our members we

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,510
have Capital One a Citibank JP Morgan

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,280
Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Wells Fargo

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,380
HSBC Georges Bank you know all the big

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,350
players some smaller ones as well and

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,110
then we have tech companies github Red

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,780
Hat and financial services focused tech

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,660
companies IHS market trade Web Reef in

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,120
of and then service companies some

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,250
smaller smaller fintax green key just

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,490
some interesting stuff with voice

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,260
wit-pro

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,490
you know big organization and come in

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,410
and a lot of the financial services

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,560
institutions so really we bring them all

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,660
together to help them figure out how to

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,690
collaborate and innovate using open

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,640
source and the way we do that is is

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,130
twofold really one it's for those

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,500
companies who don't have policies or

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,849
processes to be able to contribute we

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,649
work with them to kind of

00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:49,020
them along the scale so that they can

00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:50,759
actually engage and then we also host a

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,830
number of projects within the foundation

00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,779
where these banks and technology

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,270
companies can come together to

00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:01,169
collaborate on open source software and

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,689
standards and so the way the way I got

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,639
into finis was my career has always been

00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:07,589
in financial services in technology I

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,779
started in a Silicon Valley startup just

00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:12,360
down the peninsula developing risk

00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,619
management software for thanks I then

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,240
went to work for a bank

00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:18,089
I worked there for a credit suisse for

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,619
about fourteen years in technology and

00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:21,869
in front office in electronic trading

00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:24,300
and one of the things that's very

00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:26,339
remarkable is that it's a lot of the

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,439
same software built again and again and

00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:30,809
again often within the same institution

00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,740
and certainly across the street so

00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:33,599
across the banks

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,099
how many trade bladders do you really

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:40,169
need yeah so that led us some few of us

00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,149
internally to think about well what what

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,129
can we do to help these banks mutual

00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:45,990
eyes the software to take out some of

00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:47,669
that duplicate have spent to then spend

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,969
more time on the interesting stuff and

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:53,339
so I we co-founded a startup founded by

00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:55,409
Credit Suisse which was a little bit

00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,180
harder than we had hoped and then did

00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:59,159
some consulting and then came to finis

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,349
and so it's really you know the

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,360
transition has been within the financial

00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,919
services and seeing where you can take

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,959
you know those opportunities to

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,669
collaborate and you know we truly

00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,749
believe that open source is is the way

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:16,259
forward for financial services a risk

00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:18,029
versus cover institution Gil hi I'm Gil

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,029
yahuda I run the open source program at

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:25,409
Verizon media and I'll tell you the

00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,759
short story many years ago I was an

00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:28,919
Enterprise Architect at fidelity

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,550
investments and at the time when open

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,409
source came up I was vocally opposed to

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,419
running an open source program and doing

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:39,329
anything with open source I thought it

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,439
was a horrible idea and people knew that

00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:42,479
I thought it was a horrible idea just I

00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,740
was I was I was the person on the other

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,119
side of that conversation and through

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:53,099
self-reflection education personal

00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:55,319
involvement evolvement I switched so a

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,040
few years later I found myself running

00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,010
the open source program office

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,390
Yahoo and I've been at Yahoo for almost

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,940
10 years now running the open-source

00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:07,090
program there Yahoo was acquired by

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,580
Verizon merged with AOL so I'm running

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,280
the open source program at Yahoo and AOL

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,500
in a division of Verizon called Verizon

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,530
media so where I started in this very

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,380
risk-averse financial services open

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,540
source is bad flipped to a open source

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,470
is awesome let's give away Hadoop and

00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,180
see what happens

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,040
you know let's create Big Data as an

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,170
ecosystem and see what we can do with it

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,640
right so this sort of complete opposite

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,330
to now

00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,790
the nexus between a division of Verizon

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,850
which is an internet media company and

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,610
very has a very positive sentiment

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,940
towards open source in an organization

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:50,800
that's traditional and risk-averse and

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:54,010
you know not as much into hey let's do

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,740
open source right so um I'm watching

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,240
that game play out again wonderful well

00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,980
thank you all for joining us hopefully

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,030
we can sort of build on your backgrounds

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,350
and the things you're doing today at

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,420
your at your businesses or with the

00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,970
groups you're supporting to sort of pull

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,530
together how your organizations are able

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,420
to sort of handle open source and

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,590
succeed in it today so on that same

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,390
topic one of the things we've heard

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,980
multiple times today I heard erica be

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,170
mentioned that today during the key

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,810
during the keynote applications built

00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,430
today started right now are comprised of

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,830
upwards of 90 percent open source

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,080
software this isn't the case even five

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,880
years ago ten years ago so the way

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,950
applications are built and designed is

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,600
changing how is this actually changing

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,849
the way your organization's are building

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,099
software are they racing open source the

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,950
same way different ways what's been the

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,510
actual results you've seen internally

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,910
we've been pretty forward-looking when

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,590
it comes to how we use open source

00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,490
software and how we utilize it and we

00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,380
embraced it

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,840
I think over five years ago when our

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,540
company CIO step and said we're in open

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,280
source first organization so I would say

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,530
it's it's changed substantially how we

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,630
assemble software how we distribute it

00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,980
internally within the company and also

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,000
you know kind of it kind of led the way

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:06,640
to us being a publicly a public cloud

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,279
embrace ur especially for you know

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,220
compared to

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,759
other people in our industry so I would

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:17,180
say substantially I think you know

00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,139
you're in an organization whose when we

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,089
think about it

00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,040
much further along on the maturity scale

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:26,300
of open source then then some of the

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,249
other ones that they deal with and so we

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,220
see you know we see quite a variety

00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:33,439
there are people who aren't even fully

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,779
tracking their consumption of open

00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,160
source yet which obviously has risks

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,350
that have to be addressed and so you

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,529
know that's an issue and then maybe have

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:44,899
done a single contribution but can't

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:47,870
contribute back bug fixes to you know

00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,339
standards pieces of software so you know

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,699
I think there there definitely

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:55,279
definitely is a change even in the last

00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:57,769
ten five years in being more accepting

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,319
of that contribution but that's a long

00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:02,149
it takes a long time to get from right

00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,740
we probably have to do it and and not

00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,029
everybody is still there yet by the way

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,920
there's you know you still talk to some

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:08,449
people in you know big financial

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,220
institutions and they say open source

00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:12,889
now we're good we build all our stuff

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,329
we're fine we're used to building it on

00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:16,220
my trailer right there he's telling me

00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:18,649
what he wants I'm just gonna take care

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,970
of it this way so there is a cultural

00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,670
shift that has to change and I think

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,160
that's that's starting to happen and it

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,290
just takes a lot of pushing and pushing

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,420
and pushing across you know an

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,269
organization that has 50,000 people or

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,680
20,000 people or 25,000 technologists

00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:38,269
let alone the rest of the stuff and so

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,129
you know we do see that movement but a

00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:43,639
lot of it has to be that cultural shift

00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:46,370
and and that you know and finding some

00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,709
simple or specific opportunities to make

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,860
a few things happen and then build on

00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:55,790
that and build on that so it's getting

00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:58,189
there but it's it's not fast yeah where

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,889
we see it at least where I see it in my

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:02,720
world is that within the organization

00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,550
there are different behaviors in

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,259
different pockets because one of the

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,329
things that makes the one things that

00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:10,339
you find common in risk-averse

00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:11,929
organizations and financial services

00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:15,050
organizations in particular is that

00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:17,750
they're very complex such that you might

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,980
have people who are in technology but

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,050
they're building products

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,149
other people who are in technology but

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,740
they're building platforms and the way

00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,300
you build platforms is different than or

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,709
support platforms is different than the

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,450
way you build products there are other

00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:31,220
people in technology but they're on the

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,170
CIO organization and they're providing

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,380
products and services internally

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,440
exclusively so the adoption of open

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,699
source whether it be bringing code from

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,500
the outside or using an open-source

00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:45,769
vendor versus a traditional software

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,980
license vendor or using open source

00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:50,779
methodology to build something might

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,610
differ in different parts of the company

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,410
so in some parts of the company you say

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,240
well we're really enlightened and this

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,040
will save us money we can do it

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,620
and another parts of the company they'll

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,959
say no way we're building every line of

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,930
code on our own because this is a

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,320
product that we we can't afford to take

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,750
the risk of open-source whatever that

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,459
risk happens to therefore being and if I

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,829
may interject here a lot of what drives

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:18,620
that culture change and change going

00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:20,570
forward is the day to conversation okay

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,329
we built this thing now what how do we

00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,130
maintain it going forward or as my as my

00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:27,079
manager likes to say open-source is free

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,760
as in puppy right because now you're

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,899
responsible for caring for this thing

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,250
and making sure that it's you know

00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,279
well-fed and well-managed and all this

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,199
stuff so a lot of it that think that

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,300
changes the thinking is it's not just

00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:40,910
can you build this thing but can you

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,649
build it can you establish the

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,230
governance around this you know internal

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:46,310
project and and work with all the

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,920
different stakeholders and bring them

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:53,000
together and do it in a way that doesn't

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,820
increase risk establishes value exactly

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,709
and that's a good point to bring up and

00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,480
I would I would also add that not

00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,089
everything needs to be open sourced you

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,949
know there's 5,000 applications in a in

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:05,980
a typical Bank between three and seven

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,269
let's say they don't all need to be

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,949
fully open sourced and they might all

00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,560
use open source software but you know

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:14,779
they're their degrees and so there's

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,180
enough opportunity in the stuff that

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:19,100
doesn't hold your secret sauce to be

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,709
identifying opportunities I mean we

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,860
think you know one of those places has

00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:27,230
to be in meeting regulatory requirements

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,550
not so much for you but definitely you

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,620
know that you it's all about

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,660
transparency you have to meet common

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,180
standards your

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,790
you're trying to interpret thousands of

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,940
pages of you know documentation and

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,010
surely that's done better together and

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,210
there's not a lot of competitive

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,090
advantage although I will tell you that

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,260
one time several years ago we're having

00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,240
a conversation a couple of big banks

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,920
there's a piece of incumbent vendor

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,410
software that they both wanted to well

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,570
somebody had a proprietary inbuilt

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,100
system another one using a vendor tool

00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,510
that they weren't super happy with and

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,250
so we thought all right this is a good

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,020
matchmaking opportunity let's take your

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,060
really good proprietary tool see how we

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,660
can you know get you to use that instead

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,480
and the guy said well but compliance is

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:14,710
a competitive advantage for us why why

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,710
would we share this software and you my

00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,620
colleague and I just sort of thought

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,850
well okay is that is that really the

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,740
place where you want your competitive

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,140
advantage to be and is that really right

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,870
for the market and we had many many many

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,300
conversations and eventually he did

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,700
agree that actually it made sense to

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,870
collaborate but you know it's

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,310
interesting and you have you have to

00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,780
have a lot of these conversations like

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,570
you were saying across the organization

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,820
to you know to get people to understand

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,320
what the value really can be what's

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,700
super interesting there so one of the

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,980
things we talked about it get up a lot

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,300
is sort of customer obsession and how we

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,560
want to drive the best outcomes and the

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,540
best successes for our customers

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,400
thinking that we'll do that by

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,560
compliance being a competitive advantage

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,320
right it's sort of the antithesis of

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,820
that so you know definitely seeing in

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,770
driving open source that way is

00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,570
definitely I think helps out everyone

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,880
not just developers and engineers but

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,710
our customers in general I wanted to dig

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,970
it a little bit on Sir John Mark he made

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,980
a great comment that a Capital One a

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,960
couple years ago it came down from your

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,130
CIO that you are a tech first company

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,500
you're an open-source first company

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,600
that's one way to embrace open source

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,280
right when it comes from the top but

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,990
that's not the only way to embrace open

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,970
source sure Tasha

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,920
I'd love to hear from you as you have

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,780
sort of insight into what multiple banks

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,830
multiple organizations are doing what

00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,180
are some of the different ways you've

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,550
seen maybe more from a bottom-up

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,690
approach that has helped in driving some

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,010
of the open source change throughout the

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,080
years and then you know everyone can

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,640
feel free to pop follow up yeah

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,120
absolutely so I'm actually going to talk

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,530
about a specific

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,320
interspersing project which which then

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,120
kind of prompted a bigger you know

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,680
bigger move towards open source and

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,580
actually putting in a board there's um

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,660
the this big bank in Europe refers to

00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,070
this as a skunkworks project they

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,120
there's a team who is developed doing a

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,310
lot of development for their web

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,150
applications and internal and external

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,800
and they they were doing a lot of the

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,940
same stuff again and again and again

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,260
then they thought alright surely there's

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,000
got to be a way to reuse some of this

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,280
code and teams other teams would be

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,510
coming them to say you know for you know

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,460
for some support and they're having to

00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,370
redevelop the same stuff so they took it

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:24,490
upon themselves a team of three to to

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,620
try and just do more on automation and

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,030
tooling you know to make it easier when

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,290
they were answering these questions for

00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,230
these different teams who needed you

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,240
know new tools or services and you know

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,920
that kind of built and then all of a

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,270
sudden lots of people were wanting to

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,120
reuse their tools and it was you know is

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,650
it was making the commonly needed data

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,230
more accessible it was making sure that

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,150
all of your brand guidelines and

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:49,630
compliance was kind of built in it was

00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,890
you know giving you prefabs pages you

00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,420
know all sorts of things that or tools

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,490
all sorts of things that make sense and

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,050
so this small group of three was then a

00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,820
bit overwhelmed with the requests coming

00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,770
in and I said well hey why don't you

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,900
help out you know you can build some

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,240
tools two and two and a half years later

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:07,209
it's you know a really big success story

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,459
for them they've saved they say twelve

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:11,920
million euros you know which is a

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,270
sizable amount of change on reuse and on

00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,370
time because now they can produce

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,980
something in a day as opposed to a month

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:20,170
or several months and so and I think

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,180
when and so what that let what that let

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,400
them be able to do is say hey check this

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,400
out this is our use case what else can

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,110
we do and they did a big open source

00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,760
project and then realized that they

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,770
weren't actually fully prepared to do a

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,450
big open source project but they didn't

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,010
really know how to build a community

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,260
that they didn't know how to get all the

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,240
people involved in order to you know

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,220
further the the product and and maybe

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,170
they hadn't covered off internally how

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,420
everyone is gonna you know work but

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,790
that's then what starts the conversation

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,680
so now they're putting together you know

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,090
a full open-source office they have all

00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,310
of the right people involved they're

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,190
looking at more opportunities there make

00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,720
sure that they can collaborate

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,120
externally you know and github repos and

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,890
so you know I think there are lots of

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,390
different approaches and I think you

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,110
might have some examples some other you

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:11,080
know ways that this can happen to but

00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:13,390
you know certainly that's I think that

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,370
was a big success so proving out the ROI

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,410
on something safer internally that they

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:22,480
could then use to sort of segue into the

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:26,380
open source conversation I see I see you

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,930
know typically the pattern is bottom-up

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,600
in some cases it's top-down it's very

00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:34,300
rarely starting from the middle right

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,260
middle management rarely is going to be

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,590
the push

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,570
but middle management is is an important

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,970
part usually where the open source

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,770
program offices reside is somewhere in

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,390
middle management and yet middle

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,660
management isn't always the friendliest

00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:52,560
part of of where open source is in a

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,680
company feel attacked

00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,840
we're not the CIA we're not the CTOs

00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,790
and we're not the line developers and

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,830
yet it's you know it's an enlightened

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,330
CTO or an enlightened CIO will say yeah

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,130
open source is a good thing I read about

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,000
it somewhere we should do it and then

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,070
sort of leave it there

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,210
right and then developers come in and

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,410
say well of course we have to do open

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,760
source after all I have a career to

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,770
manage and I'm not gonna rewrite

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,450
somebody else's code I mean I need to

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,950
need to be effective right and if

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,510
somebody in the middle is saying oh I

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,890
have a problem with this like I have a

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,960
problem with somebody contributing to my

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,940
repo that I don't control their time I

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,080
have a problem with incurring risk for

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,790
somebody else's project and I don't

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,830
really know what the SLA I'm fixing it

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,320
is or whatever the risk is and what I

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,030
find from from the perspective of the

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,390
open source program office or of the

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:39,820
Advocate within the risk-averse

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,830
organization of whatever it is in your

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,330
particular case is that you have to have

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,120
the agility to have one of three

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,160
conversations one conversation is one

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,710
about fear which is the compliance

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,720
conversation and it's the who patches

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,370
this and how is secured and and what are

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,690
the license compliance issues that

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,150
typically come up right it's the fear

00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,410
conversation the other conversation is

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,140
sort of the opposite it's the love

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,750
conversation how do we enable engineers

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,310
to be effective right and how do we have

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,779
somebody who's not only a hero when

00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,580
they're group but a hero within the comp

00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:11,349
through inner source or a hero when

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,359
everyone's company through open-source

00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:15,190
like how do we how to foster that love

00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,700
and the third is a conversation about

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:21,070
money like are we saving money are we

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,599
deferring costs and in some cases are we

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,190
able to make money by giving something

00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,129
to the open source community that leads

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,599
them into some sort of economic system

00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:31,899
that we have like some of the larger

00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:33,759
companies tech companies do now you

00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:35,109
can't have the love conversation with

00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,989
somebody who wants to have the fear one

00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:39,369
with you and you can't have a fear

00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:41,049
conversation with somebody who wants the

00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:42,159
money conversation with you you got to

00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,779
be able to figure out who are you

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,179
talking to and are you talking to

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,889
somebody who is begging for you to

00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:51,039
assure them that the fear that they have

00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:52,450
is going to be handled by a good program

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,249
or are you talking to somebody who

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,479
really wants to make sure that you

00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:57,519
understand that there's something in it

00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:59,379
for them and have that love conversation

00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,759
or indeed the money and if you can get

00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:02,529
that right then from the

00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,320
middle-management vantage point which is

00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,869
the weakest point to have you you can

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,589
you know speak up speak down speak

00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:13,330
across a and b invective yeah I have the

00:21:11,589 --> 00:21:14,440
scars from having the love conversation

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,779
with people who really just want to talk

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,839
about ROI and money so yes I can speak

00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:23,049
to that one very very clearly

00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,210
I loved your point about how Tasha's

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:27,999
point about how inter source can be kind

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,320
of a open source in a non scary way for

00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:31,029
people who think of in sources super

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,279
scary because it does take a lot of

00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:34,929
things off the table that can stymie an

00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,729
open source conversation so let's say

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:38,009
for example we'll talk about license

00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:40,359
compliance will talk about

00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:41,799
vulnerabilities we'll talk about all the

00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,889
things that people bring up when they

00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:46,089
say oh my god all this open source stuff

00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:47,679
so inner source is great way to kind of

00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:49,929
push those off to the side and really

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,269
focus on the things that deliver real

00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:54,249
value and so you know I look at my

00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,499
team's role as kind of like how do we

00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:58,419
provide the air cover and deal with all

00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:59,979
those problems around risk management

00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:02,619
and internal audit and all that stuff so

00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:04,089
that you the developer don't have to how

00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:06,190
do we automate the processes how do we

00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,289
get that going but to the point around

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,269
you know inner source can be a great

00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:12,879
kind of halfway stuff or a first step I

00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:14,979
absolutely agree and that's that's

00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:16,509
something that you know we've run things

00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:18,039
like hackathons and sort of enablement

00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:20,139
sessions with other engineers to sort of

00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:20,679
build this broad base of support we'll

00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,090
need to go

00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,190
further and so if you're looking for a

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,080
way to accumulate the stakeholders that

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,759
you need to drive in a shoes forward if

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,440
you're looking for ways to get other

00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,080
executives involves and you can build

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,330
again the momentum that you need inner

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,580
source activities are a great way to do

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,049
that as long as you have support from

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,419
the right people who can get involved

00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:42,700
and push you forward one of the things

00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:45,220
that is I'm out talking to users and the

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,529
it all throughout the world honestly and

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,119
I hate to say open source had companies

00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:51,190
as a progressive statement at this point

00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,320
because I mean as you're showing here

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,659
it's it's it's definitely taking hold

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,399
but there's still pockets all throughout

00:22:55,659 --> 00:22:59,740
where open source is still a scary or

00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:01,539
dirty word even in companies that are

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,249
embracing open source and doing really

00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:05,139
well with open source there's still

00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:07,809
pockets within the Gil you spoke really

00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:09,700
well on how even within Verizon and the

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:11,350
many pieces of Verizon there's pieces

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,610
that are areas that are much more

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,950
forward-leaning with open source and

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,230
areas that are not what do you tell it

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,389
as a developer as an engineer right who

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,889
may be unfortunately stuck in a pocket

00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:22,899
of the organization that's less

00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:24,970
forward-leaning with open source even

00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:26,559
with a NOS PO even with other portions

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,149
of the org that are embracing open

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,759
source what's your advice to that

00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:32,860
engineer right who needs top cover and

00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,480
can't find it or what how do they start

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,419
the conversation with their middle

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,399
management right who to get to get more

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:42,279
access and capabilities for open source

00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:45,009
so I would advise the engineer to ask

00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:48,249
good questions and to be open to the

00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:50,710
answers I'll tell you an inner source

00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:58,240
story that kind of I shared with you

00:23:50,710 --> 00:24:01,269
just before we got on I will swing at

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,009
that it's a good story because it taught

00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:04,570
me to really think about risk

00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:07,419
differently so the situation that we had

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:10,960
is we have a product group that needed a

00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:13,090
technology and we had a platform group

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,200
that built this technology and I asked

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,269
them like why did you build and they

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,190
said well we looked at open source and

00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:19,389
we found that what was available wasn't

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,070
good enough and we had to build

00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:22,360
something better and I asked him well

00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,679
did you contribute it back and they said

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,720
well no because it was a different

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,190
architecture it wouldn't have worked to

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,470
contribute back we really had to build

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,149
this on her own okay fine I went to the

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,220
product group why don't you want to use

00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:34,330
that they built this for you and they

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,250
said it's too

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,690
skee I said well what do you mean and

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,149
they said well that group can be

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,620
defunded right those people can leave in

00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,210
fact one of the people like the main

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,590
engineer I know he wants to leave cuz he

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,510
interviewed with our group and he's

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,080
interviewing elsewhere and if we use

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:52,149
this technology that they built for us

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,190
we'll be like we'll be stuck if they get

00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:55,720
defunded or if a blow up so we would

00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,970
much rather use an open-source

00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,110
technology cuz at least still work now

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,340
as it turns out the open source

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,169
technology would have cost them a lot

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,360
more money to use in terms of the number

00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:06,250
of servers they needed to run so they

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,200
were willing to spend more money on an

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:11,559
open source technology because in their

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,899
world it was less risky than using the

00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:15,340
internally built technology I went to

00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:17,440
the group that built the technology and

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,529
I said great what if you open sourced

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,809
that and turn that into an open source

00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:25,330
technology and proved that it actually

00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:27,669
was really valuable and we did and it's

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:31,450
open source it's called Apache pulsar so

00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:33,970
pulsar is a pub/sub message subscription

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,429
technology that is similar to Kafka but

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,799
it has different modality in terms of

00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:41,049
how it handles scalability iMessage a

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,000
number of message topics versus number

00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:45,309
of messages right so it was built by a

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,919
team at Yahoo who at first we were gonna

00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:50,769
can the project we open sourced it first

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,279
to abate risk because in that

00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:56,440
environment the risk of internal code

00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,909
was greater than open source now the way

00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,529
we were able to get to that conclusion

00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:01,510
the conclusion that benefits all of you

00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:06,429
in case you want to use Apache Kafka

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:08,019
right or Apache pulsar the way we got

00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:10,360
there is we asked good questions like

00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:12,340
why aren't you using this what is the

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,840
risk what are you concerned about why do

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,299
you want to use open source is it cause

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,070
it's cool or because there's a

00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:20,769
legitimate risk like this this team

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,230
might not you know be there for you next

00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:25,240
year right so for the engineer who's

00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:27,070
getting pushed back sometimes the

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,539
pushback is legitimate a risk-averse

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,370
company isn't risk-averse because

00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,710
they're wrong they're risk-averse

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,929
because that's what they are so in that

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,399
environment ask the questions what are

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,169
the risks I'm gonna understand the

00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:40,389
answers and then with those answers

00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:42,789
figure out a way to abate the risks so

00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:45,090
that you can find success that's what I

00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:45,090
would do

00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:52,620
um I I think so following up on that

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,080
comment you know I think about how

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,880
engineers work together in risk-averse

00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,480
environments the first piece of advice I

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,580
would give you is really develop your

00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,500
empathy skills because people who work

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,530
in risk management and internal audit

00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,470
and legal and Finance they're not bad

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:14,610
they're not evil people they they have

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,590
jobs to do and I think it works really

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,090
better if you can kind of understand

00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,679
where they're coming from

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,570
and how you can actually work with them

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,830
going forward you know we have you know

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,679
several groups they do risk management

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,030
who do who do internal audit and I've

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,760
gotten to know them very very well over

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,679
the last few months and I've thought

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,390
about you know it's really great that we

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,950
have these resources because we can

00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,660
actually you know one of our superpowers

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,780
that because we have to work within

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,480
these environments we actually are

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:44,790
finely honed in ways that say technology

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,620
companies are not and we're able to

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,080
produce these kind of risk management

00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,610
strategy is about okay well I know the

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,770
risk of that but what about the risk of

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,679
not doing something what's the risk of

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:58,140
not participating what's the risk of not

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,390
being influencers in this vast you know

00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,040
wealth of innovation that's happening in

00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,260
these open-source communities what does

00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,820
that do to your hiring pipeline what you

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,460
know all the different ways that you can

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,260
think of when you measure risk and so my

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,600
advice to you engineers is learn how to

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,820
work with these people learn what drives

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,990
them and why they're there and the value

00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,669
that they're adding to your organization

00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,720
because I think that if you start having

00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:21,299
those conversations you're going to

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,940
learn a lot about how your companies

00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,770
work respectively and figure out how to

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:31,350
work within those environments I think

00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:31,620
so I you're better to speak to this than

00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,169
I am

00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,120
some of the things that that you know

00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:38,220
we've seen be successful are finding you

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,990
know specific use cases as well so that

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,900
it's not this amorphous well I want to

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,880
do open source you know and where legal

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,740
is clearly gonna say okay well or unrest

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,840
and compliance what does that mean

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,460
specifically and so sometimes you know

00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,809
finding a use case where you can get

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,220
some senior buy-in and it doesn't

00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:54,510
necessarily have to be a big thing but

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,760
and where it's something that isn't

00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,860
necessarily competitive

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,630
where you can see that there's an ROI

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,090
from collaboration so we have a project

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,260
around cloud service certification

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,700
thanks they're all going to the cloud

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,140
they're a little bit slow

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,050
they're all gonna need to be multi cloud

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,310
they all have to certify more or less

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,470
the same because there are regulations

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,850
that say you have to meet it this way of

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,680
course their regulations from you know

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,150
15 different regulators but you know

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,430
they're all pretty much regulated across

00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,740
the board so why not do that together

00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,780
and so if you can take that kind of case

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,670
and look it's not super risky and we

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,770
have a little bit of time to develop it

00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,840
and you can see everything if you can

00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,400
take a specific use case and walk

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,140
through you know what are the real risks

00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,090
what are the perceived risks are we

00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,230
gonna be sharing data well no all right

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,840
well that makes it an easier one to

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:41,510
start with you know our our we you know

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,130
is their IP that's gonna like well well

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,260
this is how we address this you know and

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,490
they're all these licenses and we know

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,960
which ones we're gonna use and we know

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,820
how we're gonna collaborate and we know

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,490
how we're gonna get around antitrust not

00:29:49,820 --> 00:30:00,370
get around appropriately you deal with

00:29:52,490 --> 00:30:03,020
antitrust concerns rewind the tape and

00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,220
so you know find one of those and take

00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,480
that to your manager and take that to

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,840
the next manager and then you be

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,820
persistent to 100% I mean in fact like I

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,230
would I would take one of those examples

00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,210
so one of the things you just said

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,340
reminded me of a conversation I recently

00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,890
had with somebody you said oh we we

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,890
can't we can't approve this particular

00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:24,380
we can't open up these repos because

00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:28,040
there might be you know customer data in

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:30,110
them right and and my question that I

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,800
shot back sort of immediately and a

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:35,840
little perhaps too directly was like

00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,000
what wait you really think there could

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,610
be customer data if that's the case we

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,200
have a huge problem here like find out

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,870
who those developers are lying them

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,760
against the wall right and let's see if

00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,140
any of em put customer data in that repo

00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,120
and let's have you know everything lock

00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,550
and loaded because if they do right you

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,170
know and it was like let's turn this the

00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,930
fact that you're even able to raise this

00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:58,460
risk that's really you know that and say

00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,890
what the hell are people putting

00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,570
customer data and my code repositories

00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,880
do they not understand that that is like

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,710
a huge file like that's and you think

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,950
that it's acceptable to have

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,720
if the repo is private like that right

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,840
that's the solution yeah oh if we keep

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,810
it private then work no then that's even

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,580
greater risk in fact we should open this

00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,230
up and make sure that it isn't the case

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,180
cuz if you and they're they say oh no no

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,790
we're sure that no one would ever put

00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,640
any customer data oh well if you're sure

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,350
then why did you bring it up you know

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,880
cuz I was about to line up a whole bunch

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,350
of developers against the wall that have

00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,680
like a really serious dramatic thing

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:39,140
over here you know and and it's that

00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,290
kind of like make sure that if there

00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,570
really is risk to abate honor that all

00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,600
the way and if there isn't if somebody's

00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,850
just throwing risk at you then you're

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,230
speaking to the wrong person right and

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:55,040
find the right person to speak to yeah

00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:56,000
on that same topic right so one of the

00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,390
things you mentioned I think was you

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,460
John Mark earlier like opens we often

00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,260
talk in the open-source community and a

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,480
mailing lists and websites and medium

00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,520
articles and everywhere else right about

00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,350
like day zero of open source I want to

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,810
open source a thing I'm open sourcing a

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,610
thing I'm starting at OspA yes I worry

00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:16,070
we don't talk enough about day two of

00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:18,650
open source and it's it's that my

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,720
favorite quote on this topic is when

00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,480
people stop being nice and start getting

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,520
real as preparation for this I did you

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,010
know that the real world is on season 33

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,480
right now I M TV may not show music

00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,900
anymore but they still show the real

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,120
world which is impressive but I'm really

00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,720
feeling old yeah well I didn't have to

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,550
date when you watch the real world but

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,870
on this same topic like open source is

00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,540
great on day zero you've shared

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,650
information but I often talk to

00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,380
organizations who are like well that

00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,510
worked until we found out our competitor

00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,470
forked our repo and they're now selling

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:56,000
it as a product or marketing came to me

00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,890
yesterday and said have you seen the

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,710
thing that people are saying on this get

00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,420
up website about our company and how we

00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,970
haven't updated this thing forever and

00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,860
how that means we're XYZ these are like

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,480
real challenges that we have to prepare

00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,830
for and sound even just getting the

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,360
first open source but how do you deal

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,730
with it after it's out there is there

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,720
you from from whether it be legal

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,880
whether it be marketing whether it just

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,860
be life I'd love to talk a little bit

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,360
about what that looks like sort of day

00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,000
one because well this

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,040
I get to tout and laud some of our prior

00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,080
accomplishments because about a little

00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,120
over three years ago we released our

00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,400
first major open source project it's

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,049
called hi Gia it's a DevOps dashboard

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,030
and speaking about the risk management

00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:36,620
conversation just had you can see a lot

00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,929
of our views around risk management kind

00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:41,270
of baked into this piece of software but

00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:43,880
you know we released that three years

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:45,170
ago and you know I think if you had

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,299
asked the people at the time if they

00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:49,340
really understood how this would work on

00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:51,170
day two after we have the initial

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,990
kumbaya join us now and share the

00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,700
software what happens afterwards I'm not

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,980
sure they could have given a good answer

00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,200
but now that we've had like three years

00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,419
of history developing that and doing it

00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,010
in a very open and transparent way and

00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:06,620
following all the good governance

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,790
policies of open-source management you

00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,919
know I feel that it's been a learning

00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,300
experience for all the engineers have

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,280
been involved there's allowed us to you

00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,720
as an hospitably instructive and

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,119
enabling of other engineers who want to

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,280
follow down that path so if you know if

00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,399
you have the the sort of open source

00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:29,139
release like a high gia it allows you to

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:32,030
kind of build that internal I guess

00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,560
muscle so you can you know learn to work

00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,440
within that environment it's it it's a

00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,720
great thing and we follow that up more

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,220
recently with a cloud custodian and

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,540
through the same thing now that we've

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,970
kind of learned the lessons from that

00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,010
first one we can apply them more easily

00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:48,619
and efficiently as we go forward and I

00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,480
actually I'm actually really proud of

00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:53,210
how we've been able to work with both of

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,490
those projects in a very open source way

00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,380
open source friendly way and I think in

00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:00,500
a way that surprised a lot of people and

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,510
to your point you know all the bad

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,430
things that people bring up in terms of

00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,730
fear of open source you know those

00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:09,740
things happen I'm sure that we have

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:12,470
competitors today using both of those

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,570
tools or parts of them and collaborating

00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,140
with competitor banks on some of those

00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,950
tools

00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:21,020
maybe so but but it doesn't come up as

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,210
far as well does this give away your

00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,650
competitive advantage and I tribute that

00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,960
to the fact that we've done our homework

00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,030
and we've sort of done it in a piecemeal

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,730
fashion leading up to this point where

00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,700
we can say yes this is this adds real

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,579
value

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,770
we can go about it in a risk managed way

00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:41,190
that doesn't you know open up the store

00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:43,980
and can actually give real value to us

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,470
and to the greater community large yeah

00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,060
I think we have some obviously we're all

00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,310
about collaboration amongst competitors

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,750
so it happens it happens in our inter

00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,300
foundation it happens on github and

00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,849
repos but I do think that you know the

00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,589
bad things do happen yeah and and and

00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:01,470
it's gonna go wrong and somebody's gonna

00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:04,470
you know do something that somebody else

00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,720
doesn't like and and that happens

00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,520
internally it's gonna happen externally

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,780
and you just have to work through it and

00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,609
so partly when you open source something

00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,079
you have to make sure that you're aware

00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:14,700
that those things happen you have to

00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,410
protect yourself as much as you can you

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,880
sometimes you're not gonna win and is it

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,740
worth it anyway so there's you know

00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,780
certainly an evaluation process and then

00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,190
just move through it and hopefully it

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,660
doesn't involve lawyers and if it does

00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:30,030
well it does but that's one out of maybe

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,829
twenty times and so you know the the

00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,290
fear of that I don't think should be

00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:36,270
enough to hold people back but an

00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,819
awareness of that you know happens

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:42,750
it's you have to have it gonna be

00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:46,260
prepared for it we find rare things

00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:48,960
happen rarely that's a tautology but

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,089
when you do things a lot the rare things

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,650
happen because you're doing thing is a

00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:55,500
lot right so something that's very

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,230
obscure like very rarely well we find

00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,119
ourselves checking in a key you know or

00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,609
a hash or something into a repository

00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,099
that can cut open source but when you do

00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:06,540
it 50 times a year over 50 billion

00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,720
launched 15 new open source projects a

00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,520
year well okay that one and 50 ok that's

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,109
once a year you know and then that's a

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,780
really bad day you know you you gain a

00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:21,900
lot of respect for the risk aversion

00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,460
that your company had you gain a lot of

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,839
you actually get a little bit of

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,339
ammunition you get to go back to your

00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,290
bosses and say listen we had a really

00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,270
bad day we did we made a mistake we got

00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,730
on Hacker News or we got like something

00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,740
happened and that it wasn't well it

00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,890
wasn't the outcome we wanted but what we

00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,920
need is really to improve our processes

00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,869
maybe hire somebody you know that we

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,360
couldn't you know handle this part of

00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,620
the process

00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,810
that we had overlooked and assumed that

00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,790
everything would go well so bad things

00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,260
will happen risk-averse companies are

00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,170
risk-averse because they recognize that

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,730
their aversion is is a message to you

00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,260
saying you know if you come back from

00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,150
the conference saying I got stickers I

00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,880
got t-shirts this is really cool I had a

00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,980
great time that message isn't going to

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,210
translate into Oh awesome

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,070
you can now do everything you want

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,960
because you have stickers you know um

00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,940
but you have to come to them with this

00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,110
strong like I understand the risk I

00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,400
understand the fear I understand the

00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,080
love like I understand how to get there

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,850
and I'm working with people I'm with an

00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,480
organization in my industry whether it's

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,660
Finnis or or complements in other

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,010
industries

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,690
I'm working with people who know what

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,870
they're doing and recognize and respect

00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:28,180
this and then we can staff up but the

00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,280
processes in place learn from what other

00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,800
open source programs do and actually

00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,660
succeed because the risk of not doing

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,910
something is as great as the risk of

00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,040
doing something and and the doing

00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:42,100
something is not just day one but is

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:47,320
like creating the organizational muscle

00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:48,760
to succeed an open source yeah Gil

00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,310
putting you on the spot then for a

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,260
second what's the worst without any

00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,590
names or projects or where in your

00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,640
career what's the worst sort of like

00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:00,970
open source outcome is it checking in

00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,320
keys is it the in in how did you is it

00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,270
because of these relationships you had

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,660
previously that you're able to get past

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:09,280
this event this this problem or was it

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,990
something or you you had you had a phone

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,150
a friend that was like okay I need I

00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,700
need this one out yeah yeah we haven't

00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,840
so we had one of those way back earlier

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,730
earlier in my career

00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,150
we had a that shouldn't have been out

00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:25,510
there we had a interesting conversation

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,340
on an online site about the quality of

00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,130
the code that was checked in somewhere

00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,750
and and you know we turned that around

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,610
and said hey this is what they're saying

00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,290
and you know what they're right there's

00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,700
this this is and and you know what it's

00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,440
actually good that they're saying that

00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,360
because you give us a moment ask

00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,310
ourselves oh how did we get there and

00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,160
why is it there you know and yeah it was

00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:47,350
embarrassing and uncomfortable but we

00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,150
matured from it so yeah we had we had

00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:53,260
those yeah I don't want to spill all the

00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:55,390
beans but you know we've been doing open

00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,640
source for a while at least on the

00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,839
and the progressive yep open source

00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,789
friendly part of the company which is

00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:03,010
wiva the more risk-averse part of the

00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:05,230
company is is really holding us to a

00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,750
higher standard because they don't want

00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,450
to have those things happen to its I

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:12,010
like the you know it's it's you need the

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,690
right mindset not just of your team but

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,089
of Management and leadership right but

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:18,309
to turn these truly are opportunities

00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:20,529
right it's maybe we don't look inward

00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:22,480
enough to say is my code of high highest

00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:24,640
quality or are we actually doing enough

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,470
to make sure customer data or PII isn't

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,420
getting checked in right the problem

00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,700
isn't the open source it's sometimes

00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,130
it's us and like that's a hard problem

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:36,160
that's a hard feeling to have but it's a

00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,809
real thought to have one thing about

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,640
working at risk-averse environment it

00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:42,700
challenges the notion that source code

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,410
is the highest thing of value which I

00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,700
think we can't get that wrong sometimes

00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,980
but working environment like this

00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:51,039
teaches us that the means to

00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:53,140
collaboration the the governance all the

00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,970
things that are not necessarily highly

00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,829
valued in engineering organizations turn

00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:59,019
out to be actually really super valuable

00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,269
and because we work in the environments

00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:03,640
we do we're forced to have a more

00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:05,170
holistic view of what a project looks

00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,759
like and what project governance looks

00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,380
like and source code is obviously

00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:10,000
valuable if it weren't for source code

00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,460
we wouldn't be here and we wouldn't have

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,829
jobs but but there's a whole lot else

00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:17,200
around that takes you from source code

00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:19,329
to things of value that you can deliver

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,369
real quick as we're almost out of time

00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:24,910
give everyone a chance to sort of give

00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:27,880
one parting shot whether it's oh I was

00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,799
just in a tip oh that was ok would you

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,660
like to do another one or not um but now

00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:33,730
just one final tip or thought you want

00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,170
to leave with sort of the audience well

00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,839
I want I want people to know that

00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:39,819
financial services is actually embracing

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,180
open source and and there are all sorts

00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:44,589
of reason why compressed margins and

00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,269
continued spend on Reg means they're

00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:47,529
gonna have to do things differently the

00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:48,819
talent that they used to get they're not

00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:54,069
getting anymore and so we're already

00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:55,839
seeing a shift and so you know people

00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:57,519
who are into open source and want to

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,170
build open source technology should not

00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,019
shy away from the financial services

00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:05,539
industry risk-averse though they make

00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:08,479
baby I'm gonna be very pragmatic

00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:10,459
and say my final message my parting

00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:13,339
message is I'm hiring and if you guys

00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:14,959

love to talk to you we're having - sorry

00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:29,539
like any good open source conversation

00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:30,589
this will continue on the internet thank

00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:31,969
