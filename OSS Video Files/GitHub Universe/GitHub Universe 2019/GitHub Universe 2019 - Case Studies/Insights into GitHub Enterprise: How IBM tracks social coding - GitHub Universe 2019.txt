Description: 
	Presented by Emma Dickson, Data Scientist/Data Engineer, IBM

How do you track whether GitHub is supporting and increasing the frequency of good coding behaviors like code review, continuous integration, and social coding for your company? When faced with this problem, IBM dove into their instance of GitHub Enterprise. In doing so, they gained insight into how IBM's internal coding practices within GitHub have developed since 2015 and information about the health of the ecosystem that has sprung up within GitHub. In this talk, you'll hear about their methods of investigation that can be applied to any organization and enterprise-specific datasets to apply business context to the data.
