Description: 
	Presented by Guillermo Rauch, CEO, ZEIT

What does it take to build and deploy a cutting-edge website? Guillermo will take you through the complexity of the modern web, whether you’re building single or multiple pages that are static or dynamic, or working on the frontend or backend with serverless lambda functions.

He’ll help you bring your app code to life with preview deployments for every push and maximize performance and availability with a global CDN. Finally, he’ll cover how to go into production—and revert it—faster than ever before, while improving QA and testing with GitHub apps.
