[Music]

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,080
20:19 has been an incredible year for

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,180
the github community in fact now there

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,390
are over 40 million developers using

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,730
github to build software 40 million and

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,400
more developers are choosing github

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,550
every day than ever before just in the

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,289
last year over 10 million new developers

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,690
joined github and started contributing

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,230
to projects and that's why we can say

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,420
today that open source is one we should

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,910
just take a moment to recognize this

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,860
where we are this world we've created I

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,829
wanted to let you all know that's

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,680
starting today right now it's available

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:54,300
to everyone that's right you all can get

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,699
your actions out there recently we just

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,039
announced artifact caching as well as

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,910
self hosted runners with arm support and

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,710
x86 support as well with packages you

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,240
saw that we now have Gradle packages in

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,010
addition to everything else I showed and

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,950
we also have proxy supports if you want

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,479
to port your npm r/c directly to get her

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,740
packages we'll go ahead and look on get

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,420
our packages if there's something if not

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,729
we'll fall back and grab it from NPM

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,280
directly I know it's hard to see but in

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,350
those 30 seconds I showed you 12

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,250
features of github desktop that aren't

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,040
built into the git commit flow yeah it's

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,350
great we can all agree that sometimes

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,049
finding exactly what you're looking for

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,420
might be a little bit challenging well

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,110
let's talk about how we're changing that

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,470
so these are the results with the old

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:47,490
search engine that we had so 70 same

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:50,759
same search 70 actual results back and

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,439
again let's go to the new one new engine

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,119
two matches that's right starting today

00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:00,659
semantic code navigation in your browser

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,469
no IDE no need to clone no need to build

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,170
for all Ruby Python and code

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,149
repositories where you think about that

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,039
you want to minimize time to more time

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,340
to review you wanna minimize time to

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,709
merge as well well

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,959
now help your teams achieve this with Co

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,120
review assignment and boom it's right

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,459
there again I'm just to highlight a

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,340
little bit more in soo-min it went from

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:28,910
my actual team to Naomi and then we

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,700
remove the team so all of this is now

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,230
built natively into github but we're not

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,299
done yet we have a feature called

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,599
reminders and then I'm gonna press

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:42,230
create and then next day and none am in

00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,720
slack you're gonna get this which is

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,430
reminders of your pull requests I'm also

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,870
going to announce today our newest

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,180
release of github enterprise which is

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,459
2.19 this release focuses on

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,650
fundamentals like triage and maintain

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,329
roles security with Newgate as you can

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,799
see over there support for dependency

00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:02,090
graph and many other developer

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:04,190
productivity tools so now everything you

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,769
heard me said today so from navigation

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,049
search reminders will also be available

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,690
in github enterprise early next year and

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:14,090
with 40 million developers doing more

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,680
than ever on github we needed to refresh

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,560
our system so you could more easily

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,150
distinguish the signal and take action

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,790
on the work that matters to you

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,650
we know managing notifications on github

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,280
has been all too painful but that

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:33,590
changes today this is the new

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:36,530
notifications experience on github it is

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:40,489
so exciting to be here to share with you

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:43,810
a brand new product and that is github

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,810
for mobile

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,930
that's right today we are announcing new

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:56,370
fully native apps for Android and iOS

00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:03,159
I'm also really excited to bring github

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:05,440
into the dark we built an incredible

00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,440
dark mode experience for both iOS and

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,510
Android free night elves out there this

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,239
is way easier on your eyes during those

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,519
late night hack sessions and we didn't

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:21,760
just stop with dark mode but we also

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:23,620
built an amazing iPad experience we've

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,800
gotten feedback that teams want a way to

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,250
sponsor their work as well so starting

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:38,020
today teams can receive funding through

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:40,100
github sponsors to deepen the Arctic

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:46,360
Circle

00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:49,220
in archipelago covered in ice spall bard

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,830
this is where we will protect open

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,250
source software for future generations

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,740
so two weeks ago we traveled the

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,320
Svalbard to deposit the most popular and

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,570
most depended upon open source projects

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,150
into the github Arctic code vault and

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,560
there there now we will snapshot every

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,200
repo that's been active in the prior

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,300
year on that date and store it in

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,940
Svalbard and the broader effort we

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,470
called the github archive program and

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,210
I'm really happy to announce that we've

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,280
partnered with many of the people and

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,890
the organizations that inspired us who

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,500
are dedicated to preserving knowledge to

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,060
make sure that we store the actual code

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,830
in different locations and different

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,860
storage media around the world

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,300
lots of copies keep stuff safe we've

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,640
talked about how we added a complete

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,590
code to cloud dev ops platform to github

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,390
with github actions and getup packages

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,190
we've shown you the investments were

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,040
making in the daily experience of using

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,170
github including native mobile apps new

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,020
notifications experience and much more

00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,630
and we created sponsored organizations

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,430
and the github archive program to ensure

00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:57,610
that open source can thrive and be

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,610
preserved for years to come thank you

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,730
