now while we've been hard at work and

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,350
busy extending github to cover these

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,300
DevOps workflows over the last year

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,830
we've also been really focused on

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,500
investing in the core daily of

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,820
experience of just coding and

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,650
collaborating on github and so to

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,029
showcase some of the work that the team

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,210
has been doing please welcome my

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,400
colleague Neha Batra

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,890
[Music]

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,890
[Applause]

00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,730
Sneha and I'm the engineering manager of

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,380
the github desktop product which

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,210
simplifies your daily workflow by

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,120
helping you visualize your changes and

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,500
share your code easily so before I go

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,989
into that I kind of want to walk down

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,989
memory lane with you so do you remember

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,680
the first time you learn git and you had

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,180
this five step recipe yeah I did too and

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,830
I actually had to post it on my desk

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,019
just to remember all of the steps that I

00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,000
needed to take and that was years ago

00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:01,500
now I'm pretty good at get I mean I

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,739
would hope so as the engineering manager

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,030
of this product but what I think is

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,220
really important is that my co-workers

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,009
and I are fueled by the fact that from

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,250
setting up York machine to pushing it

00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:15,690
doesn't have to be this difficult

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,539
that's why from the moment that you

00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,369
download desktop we have a tutorial for

00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:23,759
you that helps you connect your editor

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,759
invites you to clone and add your

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,200
repository and then from that point you

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,149
get to do what you do best which is

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,490
writing your code and gearing up for

00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,900
your commits so let's take a look at how

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,670
desktop lets you come in and push your

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,100
code without having to type anything

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,930
into your command line and this video

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,119
plays in real-time and so I have to keep

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,340
up with it so let's see wish me luck all

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,619
right

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,630
okay so what you're seeing here is that

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,490
the minute you tab in you get to see

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,110
your diff you get to add the lines that

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,700
you want to add you get to add the files

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,020
that you want to add and then we have

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,060
emoji support and you can write your

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,369
commits you can even add a co-author and

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,530
share that credit so right here amanda

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,720
is writing two commits and all she has

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,520
to do she is to push her code we push

00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,979
the code we fetch the latest from your

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,450
repository we sync it up and all you

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,459
have to do after that is create your

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:16,049
pull request which we have a support for

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:18,690
as well so I know it's hard to see but

00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,790
in those 30 seconds I showed you 12

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,690
features of github desktop that aren't

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:28,079
built into the git commit flow yeah it's

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,570
not great we do this for you because as

00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,940
advanced developers you deserve to save

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,550
your brain cycles for real problems not

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,379
get problems and you know what for your

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,120
coworker who still has that get post-it

00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,530
note on their desk they deserve the same

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,300
thing as well and

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,630
for your manager who still thinks

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,310
they're cool and can code like myself

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:51,240
github desktop extends my shelf life a

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,250
little bit longer and I'll take it so

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,580
that was just the git commit flow but

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,530
github desktop gives you a lot more so

00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,850
you see these commits like these git

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,310
commands that you might be using on a

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,350
daily basis these are the magical

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,330
incantations that you don't have to use

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,510
anymore and github desktop because those

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:13,410
are built-in so how is exciting is that

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:14,880
yeah I bet we forgot some of those

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,980
features so Twitter I know you're

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,360
listening just let us know what we

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,920
missed so out of those these are the

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,280
ones that we shipped in the last six

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,660
months so yeah we're busy we've been

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,340
listening to your problems and we're

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,730
shipping regularly to make sure that

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,560
your daily experience is better

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,510
github desktop is a GUI that connects

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,030
git and github and we make it simple and

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,890
efficient we make it so that when we

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,870
know that we have millions of users out

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,880
there we want to save them a few minutes

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,250
over time because that really adds up so

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,989
we don't just shave off seconds off of

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,420
each commit we make sure that you don't

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,370
end up in that place in the first place

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,140
so we're building the experience that

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,630
you deserve to have whether you're on a

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,150
Mac Windows or using github enterprise

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,829
and we know that once your code is done

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,780
and you're ready to gift it out and give

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:06,299
it to the world you want it wrapped

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,970
packaged reviewed and shipped as fast as

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,410
possible so no one wants to spend more

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,660
time wrapping that gift and then on the

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,100
gift itself right so for the folks out

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,959
there who just want a faster more

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,539
efficient way to work every day this

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,350
simple no hassle gift bag called github

00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,350
desktop is for you

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,690
did I mention it's free because that's

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,099
exactly how important your daily

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,180

about and I'll see you there

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,130
so github desktop is just one way that

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,199
we work to make your daily experience

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,180
better but to tell you more about

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,729
improving the daily experience on github

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,790
calm please welcome my colleague Mario

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:14,770
Rodriguez

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:18,140
[Applause]

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,570
since neha and hello everyone my name is

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,300
Mario Rodriguez I am the lead enterprise

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,280
product manager like all of you I spend

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,740
a lot of time navigating within and

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,440
across github repos searching the four

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,020
bits of code finding instances along the

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,570
way now we can all agree that sometimes

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,270
finding exactly what you're looking for

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,660
might be a little bit challenging well

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:44,840
let's talk about how we're changing that

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:47,960
so let's start with code navigation I am

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,030
in this scientist codebase and I am

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,070
imagine I'm exploring it reading the

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,190
code I read really really fast I'm a

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,920
fast learner just believe me on that and

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,020
I get to this piece of code and I'm like

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,020
I wonder how this method is actually

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:06,680
being used in this code base now cloning

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,360
the repo building it just to answer that

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,610
simple question it's a dragon it's

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,070
really a waste of your time you know you

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,040
want it quick you want it in line and

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,380
you want it in the browser so what if

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,630
you could just click on it and right

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:24,110
there see okay this is the definition of

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,700
the product but also final references so

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,040
that's right

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,669
starting today semantic code navigation

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:36,260
in your browser no IDE no need to clone

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:37,760
no need to build for all Ruby Python and

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,530
go repositories where you think about

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,610
that we're really excited about this and

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,380
we're actually doing this for those

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,300
techies and when I go we're doing this

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,280
without having to build your code it's

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,230
based on a semantic library and that

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,360
it's open source so amazing props to the

00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,600
team together says so I'm really excited

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,240
about it so let's do a jump to death to

00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,940
code search and in code search let's be

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,530
honest you need great code search many

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,419
times as a developer you're really

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,700
looking for a needle in a haystack

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:11,300
and you need quick results with high

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:14,030
relevance so let's take a look at

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,040
Robby's on my seashell repo you're here

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,480
and you know why you know you want to

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,169
actually find something something is

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,419
specific so but if you press F on your

00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:26,870
keyboard to actually launch a new search

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,390
experience very simple very smooth let's

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,180
search for

00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:33,480
or we see SH because with my accent that

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,840
gets tricky so I put that in there and

00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,460
boom you found it first try we get the

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,190
exact match you're looking for nothing

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,170
else to search results instead of doses

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,180
of hundreds across the current github

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,040
search and I could see that you're

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,410
little skeptical right now meaning is

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,470
this really better Mario you show me

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,780
search results right so let's contrast

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:59,460
it and then I really expect you to clap

00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:02,940
by the way so these are the results with

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,990
the old search engine that we had so 70

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:09,270
same same search 70 actual results back

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,200
highest relevance was what you seen in

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,500
the screen right there

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:20,670
and again let's go to the new one new

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:22,530
engine two matches two matches we love

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:26,160
you too don't don't worry about all

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,230
right so are you could search experience

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,020
supports hide relevance with exact

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,550
stream match and option modifiers it's

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,190
actually gonna go in beta we're learning

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,290
more and more so please sign up and

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,700
wiggle you in as soon as possible but

00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,890
we're really excited about this as well

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,710
all right now let's switch from

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,990
individuals to teams because teams is

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:47,280
really where the magic happens Kol

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,710
reviews are the life and heard of

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,490
software teams around 87 million pull

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,500
requests converge on github last year so

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,990
as a team you want to avoid burnout you

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,700
want to minimize time to mark time to

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,630
review you want to minimize time to

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,940
merge as well

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,310
well you know cannot help your teams

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,740
achieve this with code review assignment

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,870
so let's jump again

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,250
so I'm overhearing a team I go to

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,520
settings and I go to code review

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,530
assignment i naval auto assignment and

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,000
then I'm gonna switch my algorithm I

00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,130
don't like round robin I'm actually

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,810
gonna go and pick load balance see

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,260
mainly because I want to make sure that

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:28,680
no one is overtaxed so so I do that and

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,690
I click safe so what I'm expected to

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,490
happen now is next time IPR is assigned

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,040
to my team then it should actually

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,120
rather to the right person and do a load

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,550
balance so in this case I'm gonna select

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,980
you know dad and boom it's right there

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,980
just to highlight a little bit more in

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,860
soo-min it went from my actual team to

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,580
Nami and then we remove the team so all

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:58,500
of this is now built natively into

00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,269
github so what you said about that you

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,060
don't need to install anything else just

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:06,000
go to your team set it up and start

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,730
using it oh but we're not done yet

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,890
you also want to make sure that your PRS

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,390
don't go and you know get reviewed in

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,490
time and actually your project keeps

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,320
moving right and we got you also cover

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,320
on that and to do that we have a feature

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,209
called reminders so again I go to my

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,560
team and in my team I go to my sentence

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,779
and instead of assignment I'm just gonna

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,490
say reminders are how many reminders set

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:30,269
up right now I click on it

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,339
i select my slide channel put a couple

00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:33,779
things with the standards at 10 a.m. so

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,240
9 a.m. on the default settings are

00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,130
perfectly fine for me but I actually do

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,680
not want all of the repos and when I

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,839
actually go ahead and select one of them

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,630
to be able to do better so we're gonna

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,420
do an awesome universal ml repo and then

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,329
I'm gonna press create and then next day

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:54,630
and none a.m. in slack you're gonna get

00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:57,060
this which is reminders of your pull

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,740
requests what is actually outstanding

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,329
how long it is and who is assigned to

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,709
and now it's a team you're gonna be able

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:07,320
to review it again this is available

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:08,910
natively into the platform and we're

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,100
super excited to actually bring it out

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:15,920
of beta so please sign up whenever you

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,920
get a sense thank you

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,000
now daily experiences also expand to our

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,519
enterprise customers in fact you know

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,720
github is used by over half of Fortune

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,730
100 and we're heavily investing in

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,160
bringing the best tools workflows and

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,949
open-source technologies to enterprise

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,980
customers you saw a little bit of this

00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:44,699
actually you got a glimpse on it and a

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:47,459
razor-sharp focus on enterprise on our

00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:50,069
satellite conference in May in Berlin we

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:52,019
announced or around 10 to 15 features

00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:53,939
and we put in beta that were mainly

00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,800
targeting our enterprise customers and

00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:58,230
I'm happy to tell you that over the last

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,810
six months so since May up to today all

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,129
of those features have actually going to

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,170
general durability they're all available

00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:06,779
now to our enterprise customers which is

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,310
great we never done this and you know I

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,620
was actually very surprised I was able

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,360
to get here today and do that

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,189
you know because I was we were running

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,019
on it and all of that but we made it so

00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,079
we're really happy about it and it shows

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,459
our commitment it really you know we're

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,199
kind of humble and it shows our

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,939
commitment on that which is you know

00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:26,129
from an enterprise respected yes we have

00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:29,220
an amazing community but we got your

00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:31,800
back in enterprise as well ok so if we

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,930
fast forward we also know that we're not

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,399
done and we need to deliver github

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,620
Enterprise Server is a Tier one

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,319
application for many of you which is

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,029
mission-critical cannot go down so we're

00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,519
also heavily investing in giving you the

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:46,589
best tools and technology to a minister

00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,379
github server which is on premises

00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:51,389
suffering at scale so things slide

00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,149
best-in-class observability and

00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:56,160
remediation high availability across

00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,720
zones and sites so you don't have to be

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,790
just in one data center and you could

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,309
kind of have a logical github press

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,990
across and then cloud native disaster

00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:06,600
recovery because you need that to

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,550
actually achieve your goals and with

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,589
that I'm also going to announce today

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,139
our newest release of github enterprise

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,420
which is 2.19 this release focuses on

00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,610
fundamentals like triage and maintain

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,290
roles security with Newgate as you can

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,759
see over there support for dependency

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,959
graph and many other developer

00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:27,360
productivity tools so now everything you

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,370
heard me said today so from navigation

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,720
search reminders will all

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,680
to be available in the hub enterprise

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:38,090
early next year and with that I want to

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,839
thank you all in turn it over to Becca

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:45,270
[Applause]

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,430
thanks Mario hey everyone I'm Becca a

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,360
product manager here at github and I'm

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,930
here to talk to you today about

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,700
notifications for over a decade we've

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,850
been handling notifications of nearly

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,950
every kind on github and with 40 million

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,410
developers doing more than ever on

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,480
github we needed to refresh our system

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,580
so you could more easily distinguish the

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,810
signal and take action on the work that

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,450
matters to you

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,430
we know managing notifications on github

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,910
has been all too painful but that

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,850
changes today this is the new

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,230
notifications experience on github so

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,450
how about we dive in and see just how

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,310
powerful this is first things first

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:27,020
let's take a look at these notifications

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,950
in my notification list you'll see icons

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:32,000
displaying the type of notification

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:34,500
being received and their current status

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,150
further to the right there's a label

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,510
appended to each item letting me know

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:41,430
exactly why I was being notified and for

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,320
those fast moving conversations you can

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,750
see just how much unread activity there

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,920
is for a single issue or pull request as

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,300
well as the current participant list

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,279
zooming back out we can see that there

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,560
are still many notifications for here

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,000
right now for me to focus on so let's

00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,100
navigate to where my team really needs

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,089
me right now which is my mentions filter

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,279
an app mention is a pretty high signal

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:07,770
event someone wants my direct attention

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,230
and typically requires some sort of

00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,630
response from me we include mentions as

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,640
a default filter for you here in the new

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,709
notifications experience so you can

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,250
quickly access where your team needs you

00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:21,680
most here are all the notifications that

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,270
have had a mention of my name

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,220
thankfully I look pretty caught up here

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,690
but let me quickly dive into one of

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,940
these to unblock my teammates now with

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,100
the all new notifications experience the

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,770
complete issue timeline is previewed

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,450
within the notification experience this

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,170
means that while I'm triaging my

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,510
notifications I can take action

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:48,260
immediately without switching context or

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:50,089
slowing down so for this issue I'm going

00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,550
to assign myself add it to my project

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,769
board and make sure folks know I'm gonna

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,079
be taking this work on all within the

00:15:54,769 --> 00:16:07,010
notification experience with no context

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:08,810
switching since I'm still working to

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,699
unblock my team there's a few other

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,709
locations I probably need to look at

00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:15,139
there are other default filters that we

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,540
include such as team mentions reviewer

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,670
crusts but for now I'm gonna jump on

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,560
over to my custom filter for the

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,970
notifications team to be sure that

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,970
there's no other work I'm holding up

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:30,680
with the ability to add up to 15 custom

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,779
filters I've added one today for my

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,699
team's product feature work so I can

00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,310
easily zoom in to progress and blockers

00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:38,930
specific to this feature set I have a

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,730
couple of notifications here in this

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,620
custom filter but since these

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,360
notifications all look to be closed or

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:49,910
merged let's just select them all and

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:56,930
mark them as done awesome I'm at inbox

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:58,490
zero for this filter pretty easy since I

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,860
spent some time cleaning out some of the

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,810
high signal notifications my inbox looks

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,439
to be in a pretty manageable state right

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:08,630
now to further accelerate your triaging

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,280
workflow we have a familiar set of

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,309
keyboard shortcuts to help you take

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,169
action on any set of notifications as we

00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,059
continue to build on top of the new

00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:19,220
notification experience we're gonna

00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:21,620
continue introducing more shortcuts to

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,160
further improve your daily experience on

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,160
github

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:32,160
now before we wrap up I need to check on

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,650
one of my save notifications save

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,690
notifications for later allows me to

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,030
further add a visual treatment to high

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,160
signal notifications within my inbox and

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,500
it gives me an easy way to quickly

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,780
return to the tasks that I still need to

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,070
get done so with that let's select this

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:52,050
one here you can see that the team is

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,400
pretty excited and ready to start

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,530
shipping this new notifications

00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:01,050
experience so how about we get this

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:03,660
train rolling everyone I'm gonna let

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,410
Ryan know that we might need him here to

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,210
help us out

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,810
so let's see if we couldn't ping him and

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,810
get him on stage

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,799
[Music]

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:22,100
[Applause]

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:24,169
thanks Becca hi everybody I'm Ryan

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,590
Nystrom director of engineering here at

00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:30,109
github and it is so exciting to be here

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:39,229
to share with you a brand new product

00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:42,830
and that is github for mobile that's

00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:46,789
right today we are announcing new fully

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:49,039
native apps for Android and iOS like NAT

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,309
mentioned earlier there are over 40

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,759
million developers using github today

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:57,710
when get-up started over 11 years ago

00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,570
everything revolved around get and that

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,729
meant you needed a computer lugged

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,279
around with you

00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:06,919
nowadays we don't just write code we

00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:10,340
collaborate as team members and we

00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:12,440
review each other's code today it's too

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,259
hard to keep things moving without a

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,739
computer and that's why we built github

00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,340
for mobile now you can truly take github

00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:22,099
with you

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:25,759
anywhere in the world we put so much

00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:28,729
care into this app so that it fits your

00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,989
workflow and I'm really excited to walk

00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:32,960
you through some of our favorite

00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:35,029
features the first thing you'll see when

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,330
you open github for mobile is the new

00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:42,259
home screen here you have access to all

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:44,749
of your work at the top we have issues

00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:47,389
and pull requests that you created or

00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:49,879
assigned to and more jump into

00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:54,080
repositories and organizations that you

00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:57,229
interact with scroll down and you'll see

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,179
a new section we call favorites for

00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,879
those of you that contribute to tons of

00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:04,129
repositories we added this section so

00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:06,499
you can pin favorite repositories and

00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:09,499
jump back into them right from your home

00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:11,840
screen scroll down a little more and

00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:14,299
you'll see all the recent activity on

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,239
issues and pull requests that you

00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:20,059
created or commented on it has never

00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:23,210
been easier to pick up on your work from

00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:25,909
where you left off on your browser at

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,999
the very top of home you can tap this

00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:31,570
plus button and file a new issue to any

00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:34,250
repository on github

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,710
we also have a new tab for your

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:43,550
notifications when you're done with

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:45,380
notifications simply swipe them away we

00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,330
partnered with the notifications team

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,060
here at github to build a unified

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:56,480
experience everywhere and that includes

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:58,760
iOS github.com and Android all of the

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,060
amazing features you just saw Becca demo

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,960
will be available across your devices

00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:07,850
save done and so much more you can find

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,240
the notifications that you care the most

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:14,270
about with filters either by repository

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,420
or all the custom filters that you

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:20,960
create on github.com they will sync and

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,990
go with you across all your devices now

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,200
one of my favorite features are push

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:30,230
notifications we know some of you get

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,090
tons of github notifications and we

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,550
don't want your phone constantly dinging

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:38,600
and buzzing and it's too easy to miss

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:39,590
sometimes the really important ones we

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,200
will send you a push notification

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:45,890
whenever somebody mentions you in an

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,790
issue pull request or comment that way

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:52,790
you know it's important now let's drill

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,180
into a pull request here I can see

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:59,000
everything I need to know the author

00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,940
status branches and more I can scroll

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,760
down and read comments reviews and other

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:07,040
timeline activity I mentioned before

00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,110
that these apps are all native that

00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,900
includes this rich markdown rendering

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,820
you see behind me we put a ton of time

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,950
and care into this to make sure that you

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,440

files changed view and here view all of

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,350
my code changes in the poll

00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,760
again this is all rendered natively

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,210
including this gorgeous syntax

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,530
highlighting but we're not done there

00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,980

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,640
all of your CI or CD from anywhere in

00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,130
the world I'm telling you this app makes

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,830
me feel like I have superpowers and we

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,830
are geeking out so much over this thing

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:42,120
and speaking of geeking out I'm also

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:48,270
really excited to bring github into the

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:51,570
dark we built an incredible dark mode

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:53,490
experience for both iOS and Android free

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,560
night elves out there this is way easier

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,230
on your eyes during those late night

00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,720
hack sessions and we didn't just stop

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:07,050
with dark mode but we also built an

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:09,660
amazing iPad experience we didn't just

00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:12,570
make things bigger but we built entirely

00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:15,000
new user interfaces and custom gestures

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:17,490
we even have most of the same keyboard

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,370
shortcuts you'll find on github.com

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:25,470
this is the best github experience for

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:27,690
iPad and we designed our iPhone iPad and

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,930
Android apps to have absolute feature

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,510
parity they share a design system so

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,850
they look familiar but at the same time

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:38,490
we want to respect each platforms design

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,530
conventions these apps are built native

00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:45,060
we want to make sure they feel native

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,570
too so that's just a taste of github for

00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,610
mobile

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:50,610
there are tons more features that I

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,510
don't have time to go through github for

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,270
mobile is the best way to be connected

00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,520
to your work stay up to date and keep

00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,940
