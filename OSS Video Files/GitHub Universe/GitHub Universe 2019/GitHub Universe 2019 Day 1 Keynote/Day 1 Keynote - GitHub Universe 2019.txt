Title: Day 1 Keynote - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-14
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 Day 1 Keynote
Description: 
	It’s our favorite time of year: GitHub Universe gives us all two days to celebrate 40+ million developers and their contributions to the open source community. In the past year alone, over 10 million developers have joined from nearly three million organizations in over 70 countries. We also made several exciting announcements. GitHub Actions and Packages are now out of beta, we launched GitHub for mobile, redesigned the notifications experience, created a program to preserve the world’s code for the next 1,000 years, and introduced lots of other features we think you’ll love.

For more information on all of the announcements from Day 1, check out the GitHub Blog: https://github.blog/2019-11-13-universe-day-one/

[Music]

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:48,160
please welcome the CEO of github

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:48,160
Nats Friedman alright good morning

00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,630
welcome to github universe it is so

00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,360
fantastic to be here with all of you

00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,370
today in beautiful San Francisco I want

00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,750
to welcome all the developers who come

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,840
to get up universe from all over the

00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,250
world including our enterprise customers

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,810
the students who are attending and the

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,190
get up campus experts if you're out

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,500
there I could see some of you from here

00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,750
shout out to you thanks for coming in to

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,970
our partners as well and I want to

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,400
extend a special welcome to all the open

00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,619
source contributors and maintainer x'

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,360
for all the work that you do let's give

00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:25,970
these folks a big round of applause we

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,530
owe them a lot all right well it's an

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,960
exciting time to be together because

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,840
2019 has been an incredible year for the

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,119
github community in fact now there are

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,990
over 40 million developers using github

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,910
to build software 40 million and more

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,460
developers are choosing github every day

00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:46,640
than ever before just in the last year

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,170
over 10 million new developers joined

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,810
github and started contributing to

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,729
projects on github we also have more

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,909
Enterprise teams using github than ever

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,020
before with more than 3 million

00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:59,210
organizations using github including

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,549
more than half of the Fortune 100 and

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,159
these developers are all incredibly busy

00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:06,500
everyday developers around the world

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,350
make millions of contributions to

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,769
projects on github and you can see them

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:16,760
here this is a visualization that we

00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:20,269
created of 30 days of contributions to

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,970
github.com and on this globe each little

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,100
pulse of light each dot represents a

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,190
separate contribution to open source

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,079
made by one person somewhere on earth

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:32,090
it's kind of an amazing thing to look at

00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,920
and think about because there's all

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,570
these people from all around the world

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,989
different locations with different

00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,329
backgrounds who come together to solve

00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:42,920
problems together and maybe in many

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:44,209
cases the only thing that they have in

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,310
common is that they they all want to

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,739
solve the same problem they do it

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,150
together in public and so the work of

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,700
all these people is the reason we're all

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,850
here today we owe a lot to that in fact

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,980
today ninety nine percent of all new

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,199
software projects have open source

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,340
dependencies so whether you're working

00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:04,769
in a big company or in a startup

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,500
or if you're a scientist or a researcher

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,840
or a student you rely on open source and

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,950
you rely on the people who build it all

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,590
around the world strangers that you

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,090
don't know every line of code that you

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,760
write is actually built on the work of

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,019
these thousands of other people and so

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,540
you can kind of think about it this way

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,720
when you import a new open source

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,190
library into your into your source code

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,959
you're not just adding code to your

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,599
project in a way you're actually

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,610
extending your team right each time you

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,530
type import you invite a whole new group

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,140
of developers to your team and you

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,670
actually give them commit access to your

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,440
production in a way you give them access

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,840
to what you're doing thousands of

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,180
strangers but when we think about

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,819
software development these days we still

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,840
have this this image the stereotype of

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:55,560
the solitary developer right alone in a

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,230
dark room probably introverted them in

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,510
the code them on the screen you sort of

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,200
put slide pizza under the door and code

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,790
comes out gets uploaded to the cloud but

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,310
in reality software development is

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,829
deeply collaborative we all rely on this

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,079
giant global team of developers to do

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,000
our work it's it's in a way it's the

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,010
world's biggest team sport we're all a

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,910
part of this interconnected community

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,639
and this collaborative model is actually

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,410
better right because it doesn't matter

00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,630
how big your company is how many

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,669
developers you employ no single company

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,190
can out-compete the millions of

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,260
open-source developers out there working

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,599
in public and so we all have to work

00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,260
together and that's why we can say today

00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:43,200
that open-source is one we should just

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,599
take a moment to recognize this where we

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,729
are this world we've created over the

00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:51,780
last 25 years open-source is gone from

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:53,820
this academic almost fringe activity to

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,280
powering the infrastructure of modern

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,820
civilization if you told someone 20

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,169
years ago that by 2020 the dominant

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,090
paradigm for software development would

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,950
be strangers volunteering for free

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,780
online and that everyone would just

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,700
download their code and put it in almost

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,320
every product like they'd say you're

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,880
crazy that's not gonna happen software

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,039
is written by big professional companies

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,150
but that's the world we're in now every

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,580
time you pull your phone out of your

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,550
pocket

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,100
to use an app or visit a website or in

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,410
many cases just if you have a Nissan or

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,440
a GM or many other cars start your car

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:29,020
the open source is part of making that

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,520
happen and so this is the world we built

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,810
in it and it's our responsibility to

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,780
take care of it because it's only going

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,420
to get bigger in fact running our

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,490
numbers we predict by 2025 there will be

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,980
over a hundred million developers on

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,700
github and the complexity of these

00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,340
ecosystems scales with Metcalfe's law so

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,050
it's going to be a big crazy world we

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,630
have to build the systems the processes

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,270
the norms now to support all of that and

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,560
so today at this conference we're gonna

00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,440
talk about the work we're doing at

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,300
github in three areas we're gonna talk

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,130
about how github helps developers take

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,070
their work all the way to production

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,900
from code to cloud about the work that

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,150
we're doing on the core experience of

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,920
writing code and collaborating on github

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,450
and we're going to talk about the

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,100
investments were making in the continued

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,490
success and prosperity of the open

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,320
source community tomorrow morning we had

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,540
a little too much to fit into today's

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,530
keynote but tomorrow morning we're going

00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,200
to be talking about the work we're doing

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,870
to secure software development the open

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,220
source supply chain how can we make it

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,710
hub not just the best place to produce

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,960
open source code but the safest place to

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,700
consume it and I think you're gonna

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,780
really find that talk interesting so

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,900
don't miss it and you'll also get to

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,870
hear from a number of our partners ok to

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,730
start us off with code to cloud to tell

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,620
you how we've added with github actions

00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,230
and getup packages a complete DevOps

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,500
platform to github please welcome Dana

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,330
Lawson Dana

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,769
[Applause]

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,769
[Music]

00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:04,319
thanks NAT I am so excited to be here

00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:05,999
today to tell you all about how we're

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,339
bridging the gaps in the software

00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:10,229
development lifecycle the github

00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:11,520
engineering team has been hard at work

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,069
since the last universe when we

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,150
introduced actions and since then we've

00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:18,120
also introduced a little thing called

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:23,249
packages in a previous life as an essay

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,930
in a DEA LMNOP now VP we all have felt

00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:26,639
the pain of getting our code in

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,249
production and we wanted to do it

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,439
reliably systematically because if it

00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:33,539
touches production it is production and

00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,520
now thanks to get hub packages and get

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,039
hub actions we've enabled some pretty

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,740
incredible workflows codified inside

00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,430
repositories on github I think it's a

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,349
game changer

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,969
because as a DevOps engineer at heart

00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:46,680
and will always be this was one of the

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,999
areas that was just so hard with all

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,270
those disparate systems to bring them

00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:53,309
together so I'm really really proud of

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:57,689
the overwhelming response we've gotten

00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:59,490
from our community so let's dive in a

00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:01,979
little bit about actions if it's new to

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,529
you code - cloud is our complete DevOps

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:07,169
workflow made possible by these two new

00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:09,479
features earlier this year we introduced

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,709
CI and CD and with the reception of

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,349
those products we shared some really

00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,689
inspirational code if you're new to get

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:17,639
actions and packages I'm gonna get you

00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:20,370
up to speed real quick but before I do

00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,339
that I wanted to let you all know that's

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:26,219
starting today right now it's available

00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:31,439
to everyone that's right you all can get

00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:33,810
your actions out there so what does

00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,699
actions do for you well you can do

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,529
matrix builds that means you can tell

00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:39,599
you different operating systems Linux

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,880
Mac's windows with different versions of

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,860
your code in one click well if you set

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,880
it up that way obviously I can't but my

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,050
team can live searchable log so you can

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,970
see where you have those breaks in your

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,829
build systems and my favorites the

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,569
built-in secret store it's always a pain

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,709
to try and get those secrets in when

00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:57,480
you're trying to push your code out to

00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:59,990
production but now having it on one

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,760
place it just makes it so much easier

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,990
and what about ghetto packages it's like

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,819
the peanut butter and jelly of this

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,149
amazing sandwich for your code to cloud

00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:10,589
experience right good people like peanut

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,740
butter and jelly still

00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,449
it's available for public and private

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,209
repositories we support NPM docker

00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:21,540
nougat and some others it works with

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:24,660
actions or any CI that you already have

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,220
implemented which is awesome and we also

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,980
give you those package analytics so you

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,569
know where that package came from who

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,079
wrote it and who's using it and where

00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:36,660
it's at now the best part of actions in

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,249
our code to cloud workflow is to apply

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,529
all the real-life situations you're

00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:43,110
bound to encounter and some of our

00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:44,999
community has created some of the most

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,660
important actions to date that I'm about

00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,129
to tell you about

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,439
so get your notebooks out because you're

00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:51,149
gonna need this one that's right in

00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:52,649
action to order your pizza because I

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,740
don't know about you being the lone

00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,259
developer I needs my pizza but here's my

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,300
favorite action that's been created

00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:01,980
that's right you can now use this action

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,439
to change all the pictures in your

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,769
repository to my favorite actor Nick

00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:10,470
Cage have you actually use that one it's

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,040
awesome but let me get serious for a

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,410
minute

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,149
all of these open source projects that

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,430
you're seeing here are using github

00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,680
actions to power their CI and CD and

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,720
their general automation the problem set

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,370
every team has encountered and are faced

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,290
by millions more people all over the

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,319
world are the ones that these teams have

00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,879
encountered and we all have to get our

00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:31,500
code into production because that's what

00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,769
we do it for to share it with the world

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,500
and now some of us do this multiple

00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:39,329
times a day million times a month are we

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,769
deploying because that is what our

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:46,709
customers and our people need so a

00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,720
couple of cool companies I am a huge

00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:50,279
Pinterest fan believe it or not I have a

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,519
whole dinosaur board if you all want to

00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,870
go check it out look for me it's there

00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,459
but just take Pinterest for instance

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,889
they were able to reduce their build

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,379
time from 80 minutes to 10 with the use

00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:03,300
of github actions and packages and it's

00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,459
just incredible how you can take and

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,300
connect your workflow in any way that

00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:12,179
makes sense for you and your business

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:14,160
like I said github being the ecosystem

00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,290
and the interconnective community it's

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,389
not just about the open source projects

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,189
these amazing partners have also built

00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,870
and shared their actions for us to use

00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:23,950
so you don't have to start from scratch

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,690
and so take a look

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,070
to go see what you can already reuse

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,570
because that's what it's about when we

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,200
do code it is the ultimate team sport

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:34,060
it's sharing our mind share but don't

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,930
take my word for it to show you more

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:41,940
about actions and packages live let me

00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,940
introduce my friend and colleague Jeremy

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,960
[Applause]

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,020
thanks Dana

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,340
[Music]

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:55,900
so who here's ready to jump in and see a

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:58,300
live demo of actions all right so what I

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,520
have here today is a repo and I've gone

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,960
ahead and set up node module in here and

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,910
I'm going to show you how easy it is to

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,320
get started with CI CD and a bunch of

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,900
different other workflows with github

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,850
actions so as you heard today

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,200
everybody's gonna see this actions tab

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,270
and you can just go ahead and click on

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,280
it right there I'm gonna click new

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,140
workflow one of the things that you'll

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,330
notice is we've automatically detected

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,340
that this is using JavaScript as its

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,170
primary language so we have a set of

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,300
starter workflows to make it really easy

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,950
for you to get started in this case

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,240
we're suggesting two of them one of

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,580
them's to build and test a node.js

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,100
project this could be an app a module

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,870
web service or deploying or another one

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,660
to do CD which will deploy to get her

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,700
packages as well as NPM it obviously

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,500
github cares about a lot of languages

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,060
beyond just JavaScript and node so we

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,310
have starter workflows to help you get

00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,190
started with just about anything we have

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,140
support for any language any platform in

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,930
any cloud so if you need to be able to

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:55,090
deploy to Google Cloud to AWS or to

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,350
Azure we have easy workflows to help you

00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,270
get started and get those deployments

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,960
going if you're using other languages

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,700
like rust Python Ruby go we have support

00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,520
for all of those as well if you click

00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,990
here you can see the tens of templates

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,940
that we have for just about every single

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,740
language you can imagine out there and

00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,540
these are actually all open source and

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,390
we've already had people contributing to

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,610
these templates as well begin of actions

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,230
is more than just CI CD one of the great

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,660
things about it is you can automate any

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,730
events that happens on github so it

00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,350
could be maybe a new issue created you

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,000
want to go ahead and have an automation

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,410
kick off and look to determine who that

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,360
issue should be assigned to or to

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,160
automatically label it maybe you want to

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,330
close stale issues maybe you want to

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,490
greet new contributors to your

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,810
repository we have a set of workflows to

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,550
help you get that going

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,710
actions is really the glue that connects

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,180
all these experiences together and it's

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,070
not just events that happened on github

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,990
it's events that happen with any other

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,940
tool that integrates with github so

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,710
maybe Prometheus is generating some

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,630
health events for you that you then want

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,430
to kick off a rollback or a redeploy

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,430
again you can connect that all together

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,990
with github actions so let's scroll back

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,910
up to the top and actually just get

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,130
started here with node so I'm gonna

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,600
click set up this workflow and as you

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,760
would imagine we went ahead and created

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,500
a gamal file directly in your repo so

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,830
you can manage all of your C ICD and

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,180
configuration Rytas code you'll notice

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,770
that this template gets you set up with

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,660
a matrix build as Dana talked about a

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,760
second ago I'm testing across multiple

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,070
different versions of node I'm testing

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,750
on Linux and then doing way to expect we

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,580
check out the code set up the

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,589
environment and run some scripts

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,300
directly in line but if you're like me

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,130
has anybody ever made a mistake in yeah

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,620
Mille maybe you've gotten the spacing

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,050
wrong haven't got it all right well we

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,070
have come to your rescue one of the

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,380
things you'll notice is we've added

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,930
autocomplete directly into the editor so

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,790
you can easily learn our gamal syntax

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,260
and how to go in and edit that so maybe

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,690
instead of running directly on a Linux

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,089
VM maybe I want to do a container I can

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:52,330
specify my image and have that all done

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:55,060
right there directly in the editor but

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,850
as Dana was saying we now have over 1200

00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,170
actions people have added and over here

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,580
on the right-hand side maybe you don't

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,660
always want to build it yourself because

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,220
we want to stand on the shoulder of

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,500
giants just like we do with open source

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,970
we want workflows to be the same way you

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,730
can go ahead and see many of the

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,650
different popular actions right here and

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,839
go ahead and search for them maybe I

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,220
want to deploy to kubernetes you can see

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,930
there's multiple different actions

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,420
different partners and people have

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:21,970
contributed maybe I want to use Chrome

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,570
for headless testing or I want to deploy

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:27,820
an extension to the chrome store or to

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,650
Firefox or a word plus plug-in the

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,450
community's created tons of extensions

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,339
to be able to automate all these CI CD

00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,810
scenarios and a lot more maybe just

00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,400
sending a slack message or sending

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,680
something off on Twilio it's all

00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,870
supported right there and also we have

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,540
an easy link to documentation right here

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,459
so it's even easier to get started let's

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,730
go ahead and go ahead and commit this

00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:47,730
file

00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:55,579
and start a pull request so just like

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,440
you would imagine as soon as the pull

00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,570
request is created we have actually

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,110
automatically gone ahead and kicked off

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,670
CI

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,560
just like you would expect so the merge

00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,389
box right in your pull request is right

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,160
there you can see we're going ahead and

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,079
queuing up those three simultaneous

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,329
builds and they're already in progress

00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,920
so let's go over here and just like you

00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:15,050
can have a conversation I can just go

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,149
over to this checks tab and right when

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:24,190
I'm there you'll see live streaming logs

00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:27,889
directly in github come on there we go

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,600
you can see we have emoji we have syntax

00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,430
highlighting everything that you expect

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,260
maybe if there was a failure I want to

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,760
copy a link right to this line and share

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,680
it with someone that makes it really

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,510
easy to go do that we have search

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,339
directly in there as well if I want to

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,110
search through all my logs and I can see

00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:44,180
all these jobs that quickly pass because

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,110
we have really fast hosted runners that

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,459
are free for all public repos now let's

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,079
go over and look at a little bit more

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:52,880
complicated setup here that was kind of

00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,380
a starter set up I'll go over to this

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,209
other one this is the same project I've

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,120
just kind of built a larger CI CD

00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,380
workflow in it one of the things you'll

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,550
notice is again like we talked about

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,860
before you can have multiple different

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,750
events so in this case I'm looking at a

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,130
pull request that's targeting a master

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,990
branch you have lots of different

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,459
filtering options on here whether you

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,540
want to include branches exclude

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:15,829
branches have matching specific patterns

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,270
down below here I have a couple

00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,040
different jobs so I have this build job

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,990
that's kicking off a matrix but this

00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,880
matrix is even larger so it's not just

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,740
testing across multiple node versions

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,660
it's multiplying that by all these

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,640
different operating systems as well so

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,650
I'll actually have 12 different builds

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,940
kicked off simultaneously each one of

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,140
these operating systems will have three

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,600
different builds and I can get that full

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:38,240
parallel test coverage all at once right

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,160
on github and I'm also happy to announce

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,179
that we have self hosted runner support

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,179
now directly in there

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,410
so if you want to be able to run on your

00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:49,360
own hardware that is all supported

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,830
directly in github and it's completely

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
free of charge because you're already

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,740
paying for the hardware yourself whether

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,230
or not you want a VM in the cloud or

00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,150
you're using on prim hardware or you

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,840
just want to run it on a Raspberry Pi we

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,429
have support for everything down below

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,950
here you'll notice that I'm doing a dual

00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:08,020
published so I'm also publishing to NPM

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,090
and then I'm also publishing to get hub

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,770
packages and you'll also see here

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,990
obviously I need an auth token if I want

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,700
to deploy to NPM so we now have a secret

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:19,690
store built directly into every single

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,220
github repository and all you have to do

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,870
is jump over to settings and configure

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,880
those secrets nice and easily

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:28,600
but now let's look at what happens when

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,280
I actually go ahead and run this so

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,659
let's go over here and we can go to

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,950
actions and just like you would expect

00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,390
on the actions tab once you've been

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,200
using it for a while you have lots of

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,280
different builds that have been

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,820
triggered everything that you would

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,740
expect great filtering options let me

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,929
jump down here and you can go ahead and

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,280
see earlier today I ran all these tests

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:48,460
in parallel if they've all deployed

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,470
successfully we've also went ahead and

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,980
published this package so I'm gonna jump

00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,780
over here and show you the package that

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,280
was deployed and again we have github

00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,690
packages so right next to your code

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,120
right next to that repository you can

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,190
have your whole CI and then your CD and

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,919
your packages right there so in this

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,510
case I can click on fib tools and I can

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,760
see how easy it is to get started I can

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,080
see the readme I can see some stats the

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,400
different versions everything that you

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,710
would expect to see for a package that

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,570
you're publishing I can even go up to

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,559
the organization and see all the

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,240
different packages that this

00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,549
organization is doing and we have

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,750
support for many different languages

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:26,890
just as Dana was saying whether it be

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:28,600
docker maven Gradle nougat NPM ruby gems

00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,809
you can publish lots of different types

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,890
of packages and then share that code but

00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,059
I don't want two things that matters the

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,740
most to you is you really want to be

00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,470
able to save your time so I'm also happy

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,170
to say we now have caching support built

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,100
directly into github actions

00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,420
[Music]

00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,850
it's just as easy as going ahead and

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,470
adding a simple caching action on there

00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,940
and I always feel like the proof is in

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,370
the pudding when you look at a real repo

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,290
so recently rails actually has been

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,210
using github actions and they've

00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,550
switched over to now using caching so

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,420
you'll notice up here takes about six

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,580
and a half minutes

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,380
once they added the caching action now

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,670
down to one and a half minutes it's a

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:10,530
five minute reduction in their builds

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,030
and this isn't just for Ruby you can

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,470
cache anything that you need any

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,440
packages that you have from any language

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,390
binary outputs anything like that but

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,160
finally it's not just all about packages

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,340
you can also deploy to the cloud as well

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,770
so what I did here was I created a multi

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,910
cloud deployment as you would expect I

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,400
have a couple different workflows that

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,920
can deploy to Google Amazon and Azure

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,480
all right there and then also right in

00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,430
my pull request I can actually see the

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,900
environments that these are going to as

00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,580
well so you can get one-click access

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,550
right to that environment right from the

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,260
pull request then if I go back over to

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,610
code you'll notice just like your

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,290
packages are there your pull requests

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,940
everything else that you expect you'll

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,800
notice we now have a set of environments

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,750
right there as well so I can see a

00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,220
history an activity log of all the

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,280
different deployments that I've done to

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,130
all my different environments as well so

00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,390
let's jump back to the slides so that

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,980
gives you a quick look at everything

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,750
that we've been doing recently you know

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,030
recently we just announced artifact

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,530
caching as well as self hosted runners

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:12,060
with arm support and x86 support as well

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,500
with packages you saw that we now have

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Gradle packages in addition to

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,740
everything else I showed and we also

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,350
have proxy supports if you want to port

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,910
your NPM r/c directly to get her

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,050
packages we'll go ahead and look on get

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,820
our packages if there's something if not

00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:26,850
we'll fall back and grab it from NPM

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,830
directly and if you want to learn more

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,490
about what's going on with actions and

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,630
packages

00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,490
feel free to stay right here in this

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,290
room and Samina and I are doing a talk

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,050
immediately afterward thank you very

00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,520
much

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,520
[Applause]

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,540
Thank You Dana Thank You Jeremy we are

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,250
so excited about getting up actions and

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,470
get up packages finally being available

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,660
check it out go to your repo the tab is

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,150
there we can't wait to see what you do

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,820
with it now while we've been hard at

00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:58,010
work and busy extending github to cover

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,440
these DevOps workflows over the last

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,940
year we've also been really focused on

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,610
investing in the core daily of

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,930
experience of just coding and

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,730
collaborating on github and so to

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,140
showcase some of the work that the team

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,150
has been doing please welcome my

00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,460
colleague Neha Batra

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,780
[Music]

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:20,010
[Applause]

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,010
[Music]

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,840
Sneha and I'm the engineering manager of

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,490
the github desktop product which

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,320
simplifies your daily workflow by

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,230
helping you visualize your changes and

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,790
share your code easily so before I go

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,100
into that I kind of want to walk down

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:40,100
memory lane with you so do you remember

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,790
the first time you learn git and you had

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,290
this five step recipe yeah I did too and

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,940
I actually had to post it on my desk

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,130
just to remember all of the steps that I

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,260
needed to take and that was years ago

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,610
now I'm pretty good at get I mean I

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,850
would hope so as the engineering manager

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,410
of this product but what I think is

00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,360
really important is that my co-workers

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:02,090
and I are fueled by the fact that from

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,360
setting up York machine to pushing it

00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,890
doesn't have to be this difficult

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,650
that's why from the moment that you

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,480
download desktop we have a tutorial for

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:14,840
you that helps you connect your editor

00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,870
invites you to clone and add your

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,490
repository and then from that point you

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,140
get to do what you do best which is

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,600
writing your code and gearing up for

00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,980
your commits so let's take a look at how

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,780
desktop lets you come in and push your

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,210
code without having the type at anything

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,010
into your command line and this video

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,230
plays in real-time and so I have to keep

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:37,550
up with it so let's see wish me luck all

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:39,620
right okay so what you're seeing here is

00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,420
that the minute you tab in you get to

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,010
see your diff you get to add the lines

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,660
that you want to add you get to add the

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,100
files that you want to add and then we

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,750
have emoji support and you can write

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,970
your commit you can even add a co-author

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,250
and share that credit so right here

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,559
amanda is writing two commits and all

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,480
she has to do she is to push her code we

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,910
push the code we fetch the latest from

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,559
your repository we sync it up and all

00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,570
you have to do after that is create your

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,130
pull request which we have a support for

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:09,800
as well so I know it's hard to see but

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,900
in those 30 seconds I showed you 12

00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,920
features of github desktop that aren't

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,710
built into the git commit flow yeah

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,720
isn't it great we do this for you

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,910
because as advanced developers you

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,460
deserve to save your brain cycles for

00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,620
real problems not get problems and you

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,090
know what for your coworker who still

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,490
has that get post-it note on their desk

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,410
they deserve the same thing as well

00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,770
for your manager who still thinks

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,420
they're cool and can code like myself

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:42,350
github desktop extends my shelf life a

00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,360
little bit longer and I'll take it so

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,690
that was just the git commit flow but

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,640
github desktop gives you a lot more so

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,960
you see these commits like these git

00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,450
commands that you might be using on a

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,460
daily basis these are the magical

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,440
incantations that you don't have to use

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,620
anymore and github desktop because those

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,520
are built-in so how is exciting is that

00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:05,990
yeah I bet we forgot some of those

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,090
features so Twitter I know you're

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:12,470
listening just let us know what we

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:14,030
missed so out of those these are the

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,390
ones that we shipped in the last six

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,770
months so yeah we're busy we've been

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,450
listening to your problems and we're

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,840
shipping regularly to make sure that

00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:25,670
your daily experience is better

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,559
github desktop is a GUI that connects

00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,140
git and github and we make it simple and

00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,000
efficient we make it so that when we

00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,830
know that we have millions of users out

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,990
there we want to save them a few minutes

00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,480
over time because that really adds up so

00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,100
we don't just shave off seconds off of

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,530
each commit we make sure that you don't

00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,480
end up in that place in the first place

00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:46,250
so we're building the experience that

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,740
you deserve to have whether you're on a

00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,290
Mac Windows or using github enterprise

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,940
and we know that once your code is done

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,890
and you're ready to gift it out and give

00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,410
it to the world you want it wrapped

00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,080
packaged reviewed and shipped as fast as

00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,520
possible so no one wants to spend more

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,770
time wrapping that gift and then on the

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,210
gift itself right so for the folks out

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,070
there who just want a faster more

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,650
efficient way to work every day this

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,460
simple no hassle gift bag called github

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,460
desktop is for you

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,720
did I mention it's free because that's

00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:25,220
exactly how important your daily

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,299
experience is to us so check us out

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,920
what your day-to-day could look like on

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,540
github desktop and we genuinely want to

thoughts let us know what you're curious

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,650
about and I'll see you there so github

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,690
desktop is just one way that we work to

00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,309
make your daily experience better but to

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,500
tell you more about improving the daily

00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:00,850
experience on github calm please welcome

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,330
my colleague Mario Rodriguez

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,870
[Applause]

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:09,240
[Music]

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:11,700
since Neha and hello everyone my name is

00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,430
Mario Rodriguez I am the lead enterprise

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,380
product manager like all of you I spend

00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,870
a lot of time navigating within and

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,540
across github repos searching the four

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:24,360
bits of code finding instances along the

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,670
way now we can all agree that sometimes

00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,370
finding exactly what you're looking for

00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,770
might be a little bit challenging well

00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:35,940
let's talk about how we're changing that

00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:39,060
so let's start with code navigation I am

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,370
in this scientist code base I know I am

00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,440
Madden I'm exploring it reading the code

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:46,470
I really really really fast I'm a fast

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,290
learner just believe me on that and I

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,360
get to this piece of code and I'm like I

00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,240
wonder how this method is actually being

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,660
used in this code base now cloning the

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,460
repo building it just to answer it that

00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,710
simple question it's a drag and it's

00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,170
really a waste of your time you know you

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:07,170
want it quick you want it in line and

00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:09,510
you want it in the browser so what if

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,760
you could just click on it and right

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:15,210
there see okay this is the definition of

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,800
the product but also final references so

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,350
that's right

00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,800
starting today semantic code navigation

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:27,360
in your browser no IDE no need to clone

00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,890
no need to build for all Ruby Python and

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,630
code repositories where you think about

00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:34,710
that we're really excited about this and

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,510
we're actually doing this for those

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,400
techies I want to go we're doing this

00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,470
well having to build your code it's

00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,540
based on a semantic library and that is

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,460
open source so amazing props to the team

00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,910
together says so I'm really excited

00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:50,340
about it so let's do a jump - dev - code

00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:53,040
search and in code search let's be

00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,630
honest you need great code search many

00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,520
times as a developer you're really

00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,800
looking for a needle in a haystack

00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,400
and you need quick results with high

00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:05,130
relevance so let's take a look at

00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,140
Robbie's on my seashell repo you're here

00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,610
and you know why you know you want to

00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,090
actually find something something is

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:14,520
specific so but if you press F on your

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:18,000
keyboard to actually launch a new search

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,470
experience very simple very smooth let's

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,200
search

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:24,530
or wish CSH because with my accent that

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,950
gets tricky so I put that in there and

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,780
boom you found it first try we get the

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,299
exact match you're looking for nothing

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,280
else to search results instead of doses

00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:36,289
of hundreds across the current github

00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,150
search and I could see that you're

00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,520
little skeptical right now meaning is

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:43,580
this really better Mario you show me

00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,890
search results right so let's contrast

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:50,570
it and then I really expect you to clap

00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:54,049
by the way so these are the results with

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:58,100
the old search engine that we had so 70

00:29:54,049 --> 00:30:00,380
same same search 70 actual results back

00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,630
highest relevance was what you seen in

00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,559
the screen right there and again let's

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:12,799
go to the new one new engine two matches

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:16,880
two matches we love you too don't don't

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,980
worry about all right so our new coaster

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,130
experience supports hide relevance with

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,539
exact stream match and option modifiers

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:26,030
it's actually gonna go in beta we're

00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:27,860
learning more and more so please sign up

00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,690
and wiggle you in as soon as possible

00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,270
but we're really excited about this as

00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,820
well all right now let's switch from

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,100
individuals to teams because teams is

00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,419
really where the magic happens Kol

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,850
reviews are the life and heard of

00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:44,600
software teams around 87 million pull

00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:46,610
requests converge on github last year so

00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,100
as a team you want to avoid burnout you

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,809
want to minimize time to mark time to

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,600
review you want to minimize time to

00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,490
merge as well well you know cannot help

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,850
your team's achieve this with code

00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:00,980
review assignment so let's jump again

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,360
so I'm overhearing a team I go to

00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,630
settings and I go to code review

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,520
assignment I enable auto assignment and

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,110
then I'm gonna switch my algorithm

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,539
I don't like round robin I'm actually

00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,309
gonna go and pick load-balancing mainly

00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:16,760
because I want to make sure that no one

00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:20,210
is overtaxed so so I do that and I click

00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:22,549
safe so what I'm expected to happen now

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,320
is next time IPR is assigned to my team

00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:27,110
then it should actually write it to the

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,830
right person and do a load balance so in

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:32,659
this case I'm gonna select you know that

00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,090
and boom it's right there

00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:38,090
just to highlight a little bit more in

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:40,909
soo-min it went from my actual team to

00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:44,690
Nami and then we remove the team so all

00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:49,609
of this is now built natively into

00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:51,409
github so what you said about that you

00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:54,169
don't need to install anything else just

00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,739
go to your team set it up and start

00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:58,249
using it

00:31:54,739 --> 00:32:00,830
oh but we're not done yet you also want

00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,599
to make sure that your PRS don't go and

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,460
you know get reviewed in time and

00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:06,379
actually your project keeps moving right

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,549
and we got you also cover on that and to

00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:10,999
do that we have a feature called

00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:12,379
reminders so again I go to my team and

00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:14,299
in my team I go to my sentence and

00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:16,009
instead of assignment I'm just gonna say

00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:18,470
reminders are how many reminders set up

00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:21,799
right now i click on it i select my

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:23,869
slide channel put a couple of things

00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:25,369
with the standards at 10 a.m. so 9 a.m.

00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:27,739
on the default settings are perfectly

00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:29,779
fine for me but i actually do not want

00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:32,659
all of the repos and when i actually go

00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:34,489
ahead and select one of them to be able

00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,950
to do better so we're gonna do an

00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:39,919
awesome universal ml repo and then i'm

00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:43,090
gonna press create and then next day and

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,190
none a.m. in slack you're gonna get this

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:48,769
which is reminders of your pull requests

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,919
what is actually outstanding how long it

00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,809
is

00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:53,049
and who is assigned to and now as a team

00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:56,509
you're gonna be able to review it again

00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:59,269
this is available natively into the

00:32:56,509 --> 00:33:01,099
platform and we're super excited to

00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:04,879
actually bring it out of beta so please

00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:07,029
sign up whenever you get a sense thank

00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:07,029
you

00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:15,100
now daily experiences also expand to our

00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:17,650
enterprise customers in fact you know

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:21,850
github this use by over half of fortune

00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:23,860
100 and we're heavily investing in

00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,260
bringing the best tools workflows and

00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,080
open source technologies to enterprise

00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,090
customers you saw a little bit of this

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,620
actually you got a glimpse on it and of

00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:37,390
a race of sharp focus on Enterprise on

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,900
our satellite conference in May in

00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,200
Berlin

00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,940
we announced or around 10 to 15 features

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,890
and we put in beta that were mainly

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,870
targeting our enterprise customers and

00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:49,270
I'm happy to tell you that over the last

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,910
six months so since May up to today all

00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,960
of those features have actually going to

00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,100
general availability they're all

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,680
available now to our enterprise

00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,540
customers which is great we never done

00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,310
this and you know I was actually very

00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:03,010
surprised I was able to get here today

00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,660
and do that you know because I was we

00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,980
were running on it and all of that but

00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,520
we made it so we're really happy about

00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,290
it and it shows our commitment it really

00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,850
you know we're kind of humble and it

00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,560
shows our commitment on that which is

00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,900
you know from an enterprise respected

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,150
yes we have an amazing community but we

00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:22,690
got your back an enterprise as well ok

00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:24,490
so if we fast forward we also know that

00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,470
we're not done and we need to deliver

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,720
you hope enterprise server is a Tier one

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:31,419
application for many of you which is

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,130
mission-critical cannot go down so we're

00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:35,650
also heavily investing in giving you the

00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:37,690
best tools and technology to a minister

00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:40,450
github server which is our own premises

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,490
suffering at scale so things like

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:45,280
best-in-class observer ability and

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:47,260
remediation high availability across

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,850
zones and sites so you don't have to be

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,919
just in one data center and you could

00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,440
kind of have a logical github press

00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:55,120
across and then cloud native disaster

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,280
recovery because you need that to

00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,350
actually achieve your goals

00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,210
and with that I'm also going to announce

00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,670
today our newest release of github

00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,220
enterprise which is 2.19 this release

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,470
focuses on fundamentals like triage and

00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,910
maintain roles security with Newgate as

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,440
you can see over there support for

00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:15,400
dependency graph and many other

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,200
developer productivity tools so now

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,230
everything you heard me said today so

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,470
from navigation search reminders will

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,340
all

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,220
we'll be available in the Hope

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:27,910
Enterprise early next year and with that

00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:35,770
I want to thank you all in turn it over

00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:37,630
to Becca thanks Mario hey everyone I'm

00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,490
Becca a product manager here at github

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:43,060
and I'm here to talk to you today about

00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,800
notifications for over a decade we've

00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,980
been handling notifications of nearly

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,050
every kind on github and with 40 million

00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,510
developers doing more than ever on

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,580
github we needed to refresh our system

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,859
so you could more easily distinguish the

00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:59,349
signal and take action on the work that

00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:01,240
matters to you we know managing

00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:05,349
notifications on github has been all too

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:07,480
painful but that changes today this is

00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:10,030
the new notifications experience on

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,490
github so how about we dive in and see

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,109
just how powerful this is first things

00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:16,780
first let's take a look at these

00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:19,480
notifications in my notification list

00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,310
you'll see icons dista displaying the

00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,460
type of notification being received and

00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:26,260
their current status further to the

00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,540
right there's a label appended to each

00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,359
item letting me know exactly why I was

00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,250
being notified and for those fast moving

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,140
conversations you can see just how much

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,720
unread activity there is for a single

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:41,170
issue or pull request as well as the

00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,970
current participant list zooming back

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,070
out we can see that there are still many

00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,380
notifications for here right now for me

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,210
to focus on so let's navigate to where

00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,990
my team really needs me right now which

00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:55,660
is my mentions filter an app mention is

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,580
a pretty high signal event someone wants

00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,589
my direct attention and typically

00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,410
requires some sort of response from me

00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:04,420
we include mentions as a default filter

00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,310
for you here and the new notifications

00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:10,030
experience so you can quickly access

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:11,680
where your team needs you most here are

00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,230
all the notifications that have had a

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,420
mention of my name thankfully I look

00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:18,070
pretty caught up here but let me quickly

00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:22,060
dive into one of these to unblock my

00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:24,280
teammates now with the all new

00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,980
notifications experience the complete

00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,589
issued timeline is previewed within the

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:31,570
notification experience this means that

00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:33,280
while I'm triaging my notifications I

00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,560
can take action

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,340
immediately without switching context or

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,200
slowing down so for this issue I'm going

00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,660
to assign myself add it to my project

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,880
board and make sure folks know I'm gonna

00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:48,190
be taking this work on all within the

00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:58,120
notification experience with no context

00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:59,920
switching since I'm still working to

00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,810
unblock my team there's a few other

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,820
locations I probably need to look at

00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:06,250
there are other default filters that we

00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,650
include such as team mentions reviewer

00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,780
crusts but for now I'm gonna jump on

00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,670
over to my custom filter for the

00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:16,080
notifications team to be sure that

00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,080
there's no other work I'm holding up

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,790
with the ability to add up to 15 custom

00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:23,890
filters I've added one today for my

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,810
team's product feature work so I can

00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:28,420
easily zoom in to progress and blockers

00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:30,040
specific to this feature set I have a

00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,840
couple of notifications here in this

00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,730
custom filter but since these

00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,440
notifications all look to be closed or

00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:41,020
merged let's just select them all and

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:48,040
mark them as done awesome I'm at inbox

00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:49,600
zero for this filter pretty easy since I

00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,970
spent some time cleaning out some of the

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,920
high signal notifications my inbox looks

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:57,550
to be in a pretty manageable state right

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,740
now to further accelerate your triaging

00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:01,390
workflow we have a familiar set of

00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,420
keyboard shortcuts to help you take

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,280
action on any set of notifications as we

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,170
continue to build on top of the new

00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,330
notification experience we're gonna

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,730
continue introducing more shortcuts to

00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:15,270
further improve your daily experience on

00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,270
github

00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:23,270
now before we wrap up I need to check on

00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:25,760
one of my save notifications save

00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,799
notifications for later allows me to

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,140
further add a visual treatment to high

00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:32,299
signal notifications within my inbox and

00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,609
it gives me an easy way to quickly

00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:36,890
return to the tasks that I still need to

00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:41,180
get done so with that let's select this

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:43,130
one here you can see that the team is

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,510
pretty excited and ready to start

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,640
shipping this new notifications

00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:52,160
experience so how about we get this

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:54,770
train rolling everyone I'm gonna let

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,520
Ryan know that we might need him here to

00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,319
help us out

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,920
so let's see if we couldn't ping him and

00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:59,920
get him on stage

00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,900
[Music]

00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:15,279
thanks Becca hi everybody I'm Ryan

00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:18,369
Nystrom director of engineering here at

00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:21,220
github and it is so exciting to be here

00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:30,339
to share with you a brand new product

00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:33,940
and that is github for mobile that's

00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:37,900
right today we are announcing new fully

00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:40,150
native apps for Android and iOS like NAT

00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,420
mentioned earlier there are over 40

00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,920
million developers using github today

00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,220
when github started over eleven years

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,680
ago everything revolved around get and

00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:53,950
that meant you needed a computer lugged

00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,770
around with you nowadays we don't just

00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:59,400
write code we collaborate as team

00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:02,470
members and we review each other's code

00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:05,619
today it's too hard to keep things

00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:08,619
moving without a computer and that's why

00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:11,260
we built github for mobile now you can

00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:14,349
truly take github with you anywhere in

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:17,740
the world we put so much care into this

00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:20,200
app so that it fits your workflow and

00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:23,349
I'm really excited to walk you through

00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,029
some of our favorite features the first

00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:27,180
thing you'll see when you open github

00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:31,059
for mobile is the new home screen here

00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:34,420
you have access to all of your work at

00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:37,230
the top we have issues and pull requests

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,599
that you created or assigned to and more

00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:44,049
jump into repositories and organizations

00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:46,839
that you interact with scroll down and

00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:49,059
you'll see a new section we call

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:51,730
favorites for those of you that

00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:53,680
contribute to tons of repositories we

00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,289
added this section so you can pin

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,529
favorite repositories and jump back into

00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:01,480
them right from your home screen scroll

00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:04,390
down a little more and you'll see all

00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,880
the recent activity on issues and pull

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:09,910
requests that you created or commented

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,250
on it has never been easier to pick up

00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:16,359
on your work from where you left off on

00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:18,880
your browser at the very top of home you

00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:22,680
can tap this plus button and file a new

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,330
issue to any repository on github

00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,820
we also have a new tab for your

00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:34,660
notifications when you're done with

00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:36,490
notifications simply swipe them away we

00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,440
partnered with the notifications team

00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:41,200
here at github to build a unified

00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:47,590
experience everywhere and that includes

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:49,870
iOS github.com and Android all of the

00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:52,170
amazing features you just saw Becca demo

00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:57,070
will be available across your devices

00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:58,960
save done and so much more you can find

00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:02,350
the notifications that you care the most

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,470
about with filters either by repository

00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:08,530
or all the custom filters that you

00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:12,070
create on github.com they will sync and

00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:15,100
go with you across all your devices now

00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:18,340
one of my favorite features are push

00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:21,340
notifications we know some of you get

00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,200
tons of github notifications and we

00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,660
don't want your phone constantly dinging

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,710
and buzzing and it's too easy to miss

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,700
sometimes the really important ones we

00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,310
will send you a push notification

00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:37,000
whenever somebody mentions you in an

00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:40,900
issue pull request or comment that way

00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,900
you know it's important now let's drill

00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:46,290
into a pull request here I can see

00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:50,140
everything I need to know the author

00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:53,050
status branches and more I can scroll

00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:55,870
down and read comments reviews and other

00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:58,120
timeline activity I mentioned before

00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:00,220
that these apps are all native that

00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:03,010
includes this rich markdown rendering

00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,930
you see behind me we put a ton of time

00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:07,030
and care into this to make sure that you

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,550
get the best possible experience on your

00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:11,620
phone if you want to see more

00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:14,740
information just swipe up from the

00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:18,300
bottom here you can see reviewers who

00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:20,950
it's assigned to labels and tons more if

00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,680
I want to see what changed in this pull

00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:26,320
request I can tap into the files changed

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,460
view and here view all of my code

00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,460
changes in the poll

00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,890
again this is all rendered natively

00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,310
including this gorgeous syntax

00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,780
highlighting but we're not done there

00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:44,080
you can also swipe up from the bottom

00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:46,990
and leave a review on any poll requests

00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:50,200
right from your phone comment approve

00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:52,750
request changes it has never been easier

00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:57,460
to unblock your projects well being

00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:59,530
nowhere near your desk now if you want

00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,890
to see the status on your pull request

00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:05,260
we also include all of that information

00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:07,720
you can view if there are a chain if you

00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,230
have approvals if there are conflicts

00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:13,090
and more if you're ready to go tap the

00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:15,520
merge button and you'll trigger all of

00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:18,160
your CI or CD from anywhere in the world

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,410
I'm telling you this app makes me feel

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,420
like I have superpowers and we are

00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:25,350
geeking out so much over this thing

00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:30,220
[Music]

00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:33,220
and speaking of geeking out I'm also

00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:39,370
really excited to bring github into the

00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:42,670
dark we built an incredible dark mode

00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:44,620
experience for both iOS and Android free

00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:46,690
night elves out there this is way easier

00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:49,330
on your eyes during those late night

00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:51,850
hack sessions and we didn't just stop

00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:58,180
with dark mode but we also built an

00:45:51,850 --> 00:46:00,760
amazing iPad experience we didn't just

00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:03,670
make things bigger but we built entirely

00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,130
new user interfaces and custom gestures

00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:08,590
we even have most of the same keyboard

00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:11,470
shortcuts you'll find on github.com

00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:16,570
this is the best github experience for

00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:18,790
iPad and we designed our iPhone iPad and

00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:22,030
Android apps to have absolute feature

00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:24,610
parity they share a design system so

00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,950
they look familiar but at the same time

00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:29,590
we want to respect each platforms design

00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:31,630
conventions these apps are built native

00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:36,190
we want to make sure they feel native

00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:38,680
too so that's just a taste of github for

00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:41,530
mobile there are tons more features that

00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,050
I don't have time to go through github

00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:44,660
for mobile is the best way to be

00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,420
connected

00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:49,640
to your work stay up to date and keep

00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,059
your projects moving without needing a

00:46:49,640 --> 00:47:00,950
computer and all of this is available

00:46:52,059 --> 00:47:03,619
starting today with a beta on iOS just

nae hub Mario Becca and Ryan what do you

00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:50,869
all think of all that pretty good stuff

00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:53,539
right I'm really excited about putting

00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:55,010
github in your pockets and also excited

00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:57,260
about the huge investments we're making

00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,720
across nearly every aspect of the daily

00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:01,849
experience from from get up desktops and

00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,099
notifications to code search code nav

00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:05,930
code review this is something we take

00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:08,660
really seriously we know those little

00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,680
moments those bits of friction can

00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,270
really drag you down when you're

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,980
experiencing them again and again and

00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:14,510
again and so we'd love to hear your

00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,970
feedback and we're going to keep making

00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,829
these types investments okay now

00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:22,369
bringing it back to the heart of github

00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:24,049
the open source community last May we

00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:27,170
introduced a new program called get up

00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:28,940
sponsors in beta and get of sponsors

00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,710
allows you to financially support the

00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,420
developers whose work you admire or

00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,240
depend upon in the open source community

00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,700
and so for an update on github sponsors

00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:42,030
please welcome Devin zukul Devin

00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:44,500
[Applause]

00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:48,070
big snap

00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:50,080
hi everyone I'm Devin the product

00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:53,140
manager of the open source economy team

00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,940
here at github we're building github

00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,849
sponsors because we envision a future

00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:02,260
where open-source is a professional

00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:03,910
lucrative career path these developers

00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,920
maintain our critical digital

00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:08,970
infrastructure which is only becoming

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,500
ever more important every single day

00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:14,109
open-source developers build the tools

00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,490
for the rest of us so it's our job to

00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:16,390
build the tools that they need to

00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:19,960
succeed too

00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:22,240
as a reminder sponsors is a new way to

00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,859
financially support the developers who

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,359
build the open-source software we all

00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:30,580
use everyday for example I really admire

00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:33,780
maryadas work on the Python core team

00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:37,750
and I used to used Python and my old job

00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:41,520
so now I can go to her profile click the

00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:44,349
sponsor button and show her my support

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,390
with via of sponsors developers can

00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:49,960
sponsor each other directly from their

00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:52,000
everyday workflows when we launched the

00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,980
beta just a few months ago we also

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,740
announced the github sponsors matching

00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,080
fund doubling the contributions you make

00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:01,960
to open-source developers jump starts

00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:04,089
the program meanwhile this empowers you

00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,020
the members of the community to decide

00:50:04,089 --> 00:50:10,180
where the funding goes developers have

00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,520
already begun doing some amazing things

00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,869
with sponsors and I've been really

00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,940
excited to see some of the great

00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:18,400
projects that have been in the program I

00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:21,160
was personally thrilled when Daniel

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,130
Steinberg joined stop sponsors he's the

00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:27,099
founder and lead maintainer of curl with

00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:29,290
10 billion installations worldwide curl

00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:32,589
is one of the most widely used software

00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:35,349
components in the entire world like many

00:50:32,589 --> 00:50:37,750
developers I've used curl for years so

00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:39,790
it was so cool to see someone who I've

00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:44,050
depended on for a long time find my work

00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:45,820
useful too I'm also learning about loads

00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:48,190
of cool projects that I had never heard

00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:50,500
about before I recently stumbled across

00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:53,380
a profile for a guy named David who has

00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:55,060
this really cool project and then in his

00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,820
profile he said that he's been coding

00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,530
with his voice for five years

00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:02,080
and that blew my mind because I'm

00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:04,300
someone who really likes programming and

00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,790
I also use voice to text all the time

00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,980
but I had never thought to code with my

00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:19,960
voice so I was really excited to check

00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:21,130
this project out so we've heard a lot of

00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,250
great feedback from this project

00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:26,760
throughout this entire summer and we

00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:29,140
have seen some amazing things that

00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,580
people have been doing and it's been

00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,250
really exciting to see people be able to

00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:36,160
sponsor individual developers we've also

00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:38,020
gotten a ton of great feedback we've

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,200
gotten feedback that teams want a way to

00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:45,550
sponsor their work as well so starting

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:53,230
today teams can receive the spon funding

00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:54,820
through github sponsors - if your open

00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,830
source project has a corporate or

00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,930
nonprofit bank account you can apply to

00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:02,470
her feet receive funds as a team rather

00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:04,150
than just as an individual we're

00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:06,670
thrilled to partner with amazing

00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:09,070
open-source projects like homebrew Numb

00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:11,860
focus Babel the e-book foundation and

00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:15,040
many more as we kick off the beta and we

00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:16,600
cannot wait for more to join you'll see

00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,280
their sponsorships when you go to any of

00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:21,940
their team's projects or to their

00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:23,470
organization page you'll see a sponsor

00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,760
button at the top of the page where

00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:26,140
you'll be able to see how to sponsor

00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,000
them whether it's through github

00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,800
sponsors or through other awesome

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,080
funding tools like open collective

00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,910
patreon tide lifts and community bridge

00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,790
project level funding is the natural

00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:41,860
next step for github sponsors and it

00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:45,070
gets to the core of what open source is

00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:48,730
all about we're all standing on the

00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:51,760
shoulders of giants with new features

00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:53,800
like meet the team project level funding

00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,780
reflects the deal deeply collaborative

00:52:53,800 --> 00:53:00,490
way open source is made this is still

00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:03,250
just the beginning and we are listening

00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:05,020
closely for more of your feedback we're

00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:07,390
committed to helping the community fund

00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,770
developers who work in open source and

00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:12,320
we're excited to keep building new way

00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:14,440
to make that happen so head to

00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,730
github.com flash sponsors to get started

00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,700
thank you all and thank you especially

00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:21,290
to the open-source developers you are

00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,570
the heart of the open-source community

00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:24,190
and we couldn't do any of this without

00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:31,690
you

00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:33,830
back to you now right Thank You Devin

00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:35,540
we're really excited about sponsored

00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:37,100
projects and I'm really proud of the

00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,170
work that we're doing at github to try

00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,690
to help open source communities continue

00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:43,580
to thrive now we've been talking this

00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,980
morning about the importance of open

00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,600
source but to put it in context and

00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:50,450
maybe a larger historical context I

00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:53,240
wanted to tell you a short story this is

00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:55,730
Florence in Italy and this is the dome

00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,680
of the Florence Cathedral it's the

00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:59,690
famous Duomo that was created at the

00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,730
height of the Italian Renaissance and

00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:03,590
the story of how it was built as

00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:06,020
interesting at the beginning of the

00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:08,869
fifteenth century in 1418 the leaders of

00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:10,490
Florence set up a contest to find a

00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:13,490
builder who could create this beautiful

00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:15,920
dome and at the time no one knew how to

00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,510
construct a dome of the scale because no

00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,780
such dome had been created actually

00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:22,910
since the Roman Empire since nearly 1500

00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,240
years earlier that engineering knowledge

00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:28,220
that came from antiquity had been lost

00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,830
but then a man who is named Filippo

00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:33,109
Brunelleschi who lived in Florence and

00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:35,840
wanted to win the contest took a trip to

00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:37,970
Rome and she went there to study the

00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,640
Roman ruins and some of the ancient

00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:42,530
texts from Vitruvius and others to

00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,420
rediscover these ancient engineering

00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:47,780
techniques and he learned from them and

00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:49,850
he was inspired by them and used what he

00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:53,210
learned in the construction of this

00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:55,220
beautiful cathedral that ancient Roman

00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,760
knowledge that he was able to find in

00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:00,470
Rome helps power the Italian Renaissance

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,690
now when we think about our world today

00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:05,150
the knowledge required to build a dome

00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:07,400
is not that different from the knowledge

00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:09,050
of how to build the container or how to

00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,810
create an accurate machine learning

00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:14,630
model or to make an app that works for a

00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:18,440
billion people there's this long history

00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:21,050
on earth of humanity where big things

00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,599
happened without software you know

00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:26,839
algebra was invented

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,739
gun powder was discovered empires rose

00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:32,119
and fell and that's over nothing big

00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:35,059
will ever happen again

00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:37,279
without software it's almost crazy or

00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:39,079
outlandish to say it but but human

00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:41,690
progress actually depends on open source

00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,609
so the code you write is important it

00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:45,890
matters and it should be preserved and

00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:48,349
so it github we decided we should do

00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:50,479
something and to be honest we might have

00:55:48,349 --> 00:56:01,369
gotten a little carried away but let's

00:55:50,479 --> 00:56:03,400
just see for yourself deep in the Arctic

00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:03,400
Circle

00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:12,730
in archipelago covered in ice spall bard

00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:18,030
home to the northernmost town in the

00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:18,030
world to thousands of polar bears

00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:27,630
and it is here you can find the global

00:56:23,009 --> 00:56:30,509
Seed Vault millions of seeds have been

00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:33,719
sent here from across the globe first

00:56:30,509 --> 00:56:37,200
secure long-term storage in cold and dry

00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:39,690
rock vaults just down the road is a

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,140
decommissioned coal mine that has taken

00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:44,449
on new life

00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,449
[Music]

00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:56,140
this is where we will protect open

00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,140
source software for future generations

00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:05,740
deep within the permafrost layer which

00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:07,360
can stretch up to 400 meters thick we

00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:11,140
will store the world's open-source

00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:13,420
software on silver halide film the data

00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,510
is encoded on frames with eight point

00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:21,550
eight million pixels each and designed

00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:23,980
to last over 1,000 years in our initial

00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:25,990
deposit we archive thousands of the

00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,810
world's most dependent on open-source

00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:30,500
projects

00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,500
[Music]

00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:40,590
the work of hundreds of thousands of

00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:43,939
developers from around the world

00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,939
[Music]

00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:54,809
we will return next spring during the

00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:54,809
perpetual light of the Midnight Sun

00:57:54,910 --> 00:58:03,630
to deposit every active public

00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:08,339
repository on github for safekeeping in

00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:08,339
the github our dick code vault

00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:20,390
all right Wow a little bit crazy we know

00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:22,790
so two weeks ago we traveled the

00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:25,490
Svalbard to deposit the most popular and

00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,620
most depended upon open-source projects

00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:30,260
into the github Arctic code vault and

00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:33,440
they're there now and the beauty of this

00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:35,870
place is just stunning it's so remote

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,660
there's fewer than 3,000 people that

00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:41,000
live in Svalbard but we actually met a

00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:43,820
number of github users they're using

00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,860
open source software to drive scientific

00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:48,440
instruments and interpret their data to

00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:50,090
study the aurora borealis and I think

00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,400
one of them is here somewhere Katie

00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:54,230
wherever you are and so it turns out

00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,130
software is everywhere even this crazy

00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:59,930
remote place runs on open source and so

00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:02,210
this is our code vault and to make sure

00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:04,670
that your code is included all you need

00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:07,520
to do is have an active public repo by

00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:09,740
February 2nd of next year we will

00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,410
snapshot every repo that's been active

00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:15,680
in the prior year on that date and store

00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:18,710
it in Svalbard now this effort was

00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,840
inspired by many people and especially

00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:24,010
inspired by generations of people who

00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:27,620
have made archiving their life's work

00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:29,420
archivists are so important and so this

00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,860
actually the github Arctic code vault is

00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,470
just one piece of the work we're doing

00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,120
to preserve and protect open source for

00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:37,700
developers who are here today and for

00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,560
developers yet to come and the broader

00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,080
effort we called the github archive

00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,550
program and I'm really happy to announce

00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,290
that we've partnered with many of the

00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:47,180
people and the organizations that

00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:49,580
inspired us who are dedicated to

00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:52,190
preserving knowledge to make sure that

00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,930
we store the actual code in different

00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,480
locations and different storage media

00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:58,790
around the world lots of copies keep

00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,680
stuff safe and so a few of our partners

00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:02,180
are actually here today the Internet

01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,800
Archive talking about how the wayback

01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,800
machine will give you full access to

01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:09,560
github the Arctic world archive software

01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,480
Heritage Foundation long now Stanford

01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,340
and Microsoft Research which is

01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,530
developing project silica which is a ten

01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:18,050
thousand year storage medium so they'll

01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,560
be here on the main stage at 4:15 don't

01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,540
miss it

01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,990
alright it has been an action-packed

01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,119
morning let's recap

01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,830
what we went through today we've talked

01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:26,700
about how he added a complete code to

01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,710
cloud DevOps

01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,820
platform to github with github actions

01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:31,440
and getup packages

01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,270
we've shown you the investments were

01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,089
making in the daily experience of using

01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:38,220
github including native mobile apps new

01:00:36,089 --> 01:00:41,070
notifications experience and much more

01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:43,680
and we created sponsored organizations
