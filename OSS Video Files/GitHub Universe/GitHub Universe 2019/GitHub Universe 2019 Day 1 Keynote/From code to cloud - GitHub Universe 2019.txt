Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 Day 1 Keynote
Description: 
	From code to cloud, with GitHub Actions and Packages

We’ve made GitHub Actions and Packages a part of every developer account with included minutes, storage, and data transfer—and it’s free for all public repositories. You can use Actions to automatically publish new package versions to GitHub Packages, trigger package installs with Actions, and install packages and images hosted on GitHub Packages or your preferred registry of record with minimal configurations.
