Title: From code to cloud - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-14
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 Day 1 Keynote
Description: 
	From code to cloud, with GitHub Actions and Packages

We’ve made GitHub Actions and Packages a part of every developer account with included minutes, storage, and data transfer—and it’s free for all public repositories. You can use Actions to automatically publish new package versions to GitHub Packages, trigger package installs with Actions, and install packages and images hosted on GitHub Packages or your preferred registry of record with minimal configurations. 

Learn more about automation on GitHub: https://github.com/features#ci-cd

okay to start us off with Cody cloud to

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,290
tell you how we've added with github

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,719
actions and get uh packages a complete

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:21,390
DevOps platform - github please welcome

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:23,609
Dana Lawson Dana thanks NAT I am so

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,769
excited to be here today to tell you all

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,260
about how we're bridging the gaps in the

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:30,269
software development lifecycle the

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,650
github engineering team has been hard at

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,200
work since the last universe when we

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,309
introduced actions and since then we've

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,250
also introduced a little thing called

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:43,379
packages in a previous life as an essay

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,059
in a DEA LMNOP now VP we all have felt

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,770
the pain of getting our code in

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,379
production and we wanted to do it

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,719
reliably systematically because if it

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,460
touches production it is production and

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,649
now thanks to get hub packages and

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,170
github actions we've enabled some pretty

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,870
incredible workflows codified and inside

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,640
repositories on github I think it's a

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,019
game changer because as a DevOps

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
engineer at heart and will always be

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,500
this was one of the areas that was just

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,409
so hard with all those disparate systems

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,810
to bring them together so I'm really

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,560
really proud of the overwhelming

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,390
response we've gotten from our community

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,880
so let's dive in a little bit about

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,130
actions if it's new to you code - cloud

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,100
is our complete DevOps workflow made

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,869
possible by these two new features

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,759
earlier this year we introduced CI and

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,840
CD and with the reception of those

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,509
products we shared some really

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,820
inspirational code if you're new to get

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,770
actions and packages I'm gonna get you

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,079
up to speed real quick but before I do

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,470
that I wanted to let you all know that

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,149
starting today right now it's available

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,040
to everyone that's right

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,270
you all can get your actions out there

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,700
[Applause]

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,680
so what does actions do for you well you

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,420
can do matrix builds that means you can

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,280
tell you different operating systems

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,680
Linux Mac's windows with different

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,240
versions of your code in one click well

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,780
if you set it up that way obviously I

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,670
can't but my team can live searchable

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,590
log so you can see where you have those

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,270
breaks in your build systems and my

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,440
favorites the built-in secret store it's

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,820
always a pain to

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,750
try and get those secrets in when you're

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,610
trying to push your code out to

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,150
production but now having it on one

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,740
place it just makes it so much easier

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,120
and what about getting packages it's

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,950
like the peanut butter and jelly of this

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,280
amazing sandwich for your code to cloud

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,380
experience right good people like peanut

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,290
butter and jelly still it's available

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,960
for public and private repositories we

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,380
support NPM docker nougat and some

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,230
others it works with actions or any CI

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,270
that you already have implemented which

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,790
is awesome and we also give you those

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,950
package analytics so you know where that

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,160
package came from who wrote it and who's

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,590
using it and where it's at now the best

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,480
part of actions in our code to cloud

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,400
workflow is to apply all the real-life

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,910
situations you're bound to encounter and

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,410
some of our community has created some

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,790
of the most important actions to date

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,260
that I'm about to tell you about

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,570
so get your notebooks out because you're

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,280
gonna need this one that's right in

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,780
action to order your pizza because I

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,960
don't know about you being the lone

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,360
developer I needs my pizza but here's my

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,459
favorite action that's been created

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,110
that's right you can now use this action

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,570
to change all the pictures in your

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,900
repository to my favorite actor Nick

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,630
Cage have you actually use that one it's

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,200
awesome but let me get serious for a

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,540
minute

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
all of these open source projects that

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,560
you're seeing here are using github

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,660
actions to power their CI and CD and

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,610
their general automation the problems

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,200
that every team has encountered and are

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,239
faced by millions more people all over

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,330
the world are the ones that these teams

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,769
have encountered and we all have to get

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,480
our code into production because that's

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,120
what we do it for to share it with the

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,940
world and now some of us do this

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,070
multiple times a day million times a

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,630
month are we deploying because that is

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:06,510
what our customers and our people need

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:08,580
so a couple of cool companies I am a

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,230
huge Pinterest fan believe it or not I

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,280
have a whole dinosaur board if you all

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,040
want to go check it out

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,810
look for me it's there but just take

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,640
Pinterest for instance they were able to

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,310
reduce their build time from 80 minutes

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,380
to 10 with the use of github actions and

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,780
packages and it's just incredible how

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,910
you can take and connect your workflow

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,470
in any way that makes sense for you and

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,420
your business like I said github being

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,730
the ecosystem and the interconnected

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,770
community it's not just about the open

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,630
source projects these amazing partners

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,610
have also built and shared their actions

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,280
for us to use so you don't have to start

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,200
from scratch and so take a look to go

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,580
see what you can already reuse because

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,530
that's what it's about when we do code

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,680
it is the ultimate team sport it's

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,540
sharing our mind share but don't take my

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,050
word for it to show you more about

00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:02,090
actions and packages live let me

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,090
introduce my friend and colleague Jeremy

00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:13,470
thanks Dana so who here is ready to jump

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,400
in and see a live demo of actions all

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,680
right so what I have here today is a

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,300
repo and I've gone ahead and set up node

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,370
module in here and I'm gonna show you

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,110
how easy it is to get started with CI CD

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,690
and a bunch of different other workflows

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,310
with github actions so as you heard

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,780
today yeah everybody's gonna see this

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,940
actions tab and you can just go ahead

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,130
and click on it right there I'm gonna

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,030
click new workflow one of the things

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,220
that you'll notice is we've

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,320
automatically detected that this is

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,360
using JavaScript as its primary language

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,950
so we have a set of starter workflows to

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,110
make it really easy for you to get

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,820
started in this case we're suggesting

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,710
two of them one of them's to build and

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,290
test a nodejs project this could be an

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,570
app a module web service or deploying or

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,510
another one to do CD which will deploy

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,340
to get packages as well as NPM but

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,050
obviously github cares about a lot of

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,760
languages beyond just JavaScript and

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,990
node so we have starter workflows to

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,360
help you get started with just about

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,450
anything we have support for any

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,460
language any platform in any cloud so if

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,220
you need to be able to deploy to Google

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,870
cloud to AWS or to Azure we have easy

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,490
workflows to help you get started and

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,740
get those deployments going if you're

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,680
using other languages like rust Python

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,990
Ruby go we have support for all of those

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,300
as well if you click here you can see

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,070
the tens of templates that we have for

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,750
just about every single language you can

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,490
imagine out there and these are actually

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,230
all open source and we've already had

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,110
people contributing to these templates

00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,970
as well but get up actions is more than

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,780
just see ICD one of the great things

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,030
about it is you can automate any of

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,310
that happens on github so it could be

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,960
maybe a new issue created you want to go

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,280
ahead and have an automation kick off

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,540
and look to determine who that issue

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,460
should be assigned to or to

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,290
automatically label it maybe you want to

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,460
close stale issues maybe you want to

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,620
greet new contributors to your

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,000
repository we have a set of workflows to

00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,680
help you get that going and get up

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,870
actions is really the glue that connects

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,310
all these experiences together and it's

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,200
not just events that happen on github

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,120
it's events that happen with any other

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,830
tool that integrates with github so

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,840
maybe Prometheus is generating some

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,760
health events for you that you then want

00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,560
to kick off at rollback or a redeploy

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,680
again you can connect that all together

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,120
with github actions so let's scroll back

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,040
up to the top and actually just get

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,290
started here with node so I'm gonna

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,760
click set up this workflow and as you

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,890
would imagine we went ahead and created

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,750
a gamal file directly in your repo so

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,960
you can manage all of your CI CD and

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,310
configuration Rytas code you'll notice

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,900
that this template gets you set up with

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,790
a matrix build as Dana talked about a

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,890
second ago I'm testing across multiple

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,200
different versions of node I'm testing

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,880
on Linux and then doing way to expect we

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,710
check out the code set up the

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,720
environment and run some scripts

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,430
directly in line but if you're like me

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,260
has anybody ever made a mistake in yeah

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,750
Mille maybe you've gotten the spacing

00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,180
wrong haven't got it all right well we

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,200
have come to your rescue one of the

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,510
things you'll notice is we've added

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,060
autocomplete directly into the editor so

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,890
you can easily learn our gamal syntax

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,390
and how to go in and edit that so maybe

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,820
instead of running directly on a Linux

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,950
VM maybe I want to do a container I can

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,460
specify my image and have that all done

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:15,220
right there directly in the editor but

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,010
as Dana was saying we now have over 1200

00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,300
actions people have added and over here

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,710
on the right hand side maybe you don't

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,790
always want to build it yourself because

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,350
we want to stand on the shoulder of

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,630
giants just like we do with open source

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,100
we want workflows to be the same way you

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,860
can go ahead and see many of the

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,780
different popular actions right here and

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,969
go ahead and search for them maybe I

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,349
want to deploy to kubernetes you can see

00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,089
there's multiple different actions

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,580
different partners and people have

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:42,190
contributed maybe I want to use Chrome

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,700
for headless testing or I want to deploy

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,950
an extension to the chrome store or to

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,780
Firefox or a word plus plug-in the

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,580
community's created tons of extensions

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,470
to be able to automate all the CI CD

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,610
scenarios and a lot more maybe just

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,380
sending a slack message

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,720
or sending something off on Twilio it's

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,790
all supported right there and also we

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,730
have an easy link to documentation right

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,410
here so it's even easier to get started

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:14,140
let's go ahead and go ahead and commit

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:15,459
this file and start a pull request so

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,170
just like you would imagine as soon as

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,300
the pull request is created we have

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,040
actually automatically gone ahead and

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,990
kicked off CI just like you would expect

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,000
so the merge box right in your pull

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,440
request is right there you can see we're

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,510
going ahead and queuing up those three

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,000
simultaneous builds and they're already

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,589
in progress so let's go over here and

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,120
just like you can have a conversation I

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,250
can just go over to this checks tab and

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,810
right when I'm there you'll see live

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:46,959
streaming logs directly in github come

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:49,060
on there we go you can see we have emoji

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,860
we have syntax highlighting everything

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,630
that you expect maybe if there was a

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,339
failure I want to copy a link right to

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,290
this line and share it with someone that

00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:58,300
makes it really easy to go do that we

00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,980
have search directly in there as well if

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,779
I want to search through all my logs and

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,579
I can see all these jobs that quickly

00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,500
pass because we have really fast hosted

00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:08,949
runners that are free for all public

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,690
repos now let's go over and look at a

00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:11,980
little bit more complicated setup here

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,570
if that was kind of a starter set up

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,010
I'll go over to this other one this is

00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,970
the same project I've just kind of built

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,199
a larger CI CD workflow in it one of the

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,160
things you'll notice is again like we

00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:22,570
talked about before you can have

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,459
multiple different events so in this

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,589
case I'm looking at a pull request

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:28,240
that's targeting a master branch you

00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:29,470
have lots of different filtering options

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,649
on here whether you want to include

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,740
branches exclude branches have matching

00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:36,970
specific patterns down below here I have

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,500
a couple different jobs so I have this

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,959
build job that's kicking off a matrix

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,550
but this matrix is even larger so it's

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,680
not just testing across multiple node

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,089
versions it's multiplying that by all

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,339
these different operating systems as

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:50,410
well so I'll actually have 12 different

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,820
builds kicked off simultaneously each

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,290
one of these operating systems will have

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,750
three different a can get that full

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,390
parallel test coverage all at once right

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,279
on github and I'm also happy to announce

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:03,329
that we have self hosted runner support

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,329
now directly in there

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,540
so if you want to be able to run on your

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,490
own hardware that is all supported

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,959
directly in github and it's completely

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,399
free of charge because you're already

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,870
paying for the hardware yourself whether

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,360
or not you want a VM in the cloud or

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,279
you're using on prim hardware or you

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,970
just want to run it on a Raspberry Pi we

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,560
have support for everything down below

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,079
here you'll notice that I'm doing a dual

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,149
published so I'm also publishing to NPM

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,220
and then I'm also publishing to get hub

00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:31,899
packages and you'll also see here

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,120
obviously I need an auth token if I want

00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:35,860
to deploy to NPM so we now have a secret

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,819
store built directly into every single

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,350
github repository and all you have to do

00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:43,000
is jump over to settings and configure

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,009
those secrets nice and easily

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,730
but now let's look at what happens when

00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:50,410
I actually go ahead and run this so

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,790
let's go over here and we can go to

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,079
actions and just like you would expect

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,519
on the actions tab once you've been

00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,329
using it for a while you have lots of

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,439
different builds that have been

00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,949
triggered everything that you would

00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:01,990
expect great filtering options let me

00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:04,060
jump down here and you can go ahead and

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,410
see earlier today I ran all these tests

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,589
in parallel they've all deployed

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,600
successfully we've also went ahead and

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,110
published this package so I'm gonna jump

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,910
over here and show you the package that

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,410
was deployed and again we have github

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,759
packages so right next to your code

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,250
right next to that repository you can

00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,319
have your whole CI and then your CD and

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,050
your packages right there so in this

00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,639
case I can click on fib tools and I can

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,889
see how easy it is to get started I can

00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,240
see the readme I can see some stats the

00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,560
different versions everything that you

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,839
would expect to see for a package that

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,699
you're publishing I can even go up to

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:37,720
the organization and see all the

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,370
different packages that this

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,680
organization is doing and we have

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,910
support for many different languages

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,990
just as Dana was saying whether it be

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,730
docker maven Gradle nougat NPM Ruby gems

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,939
you can publish lots of different types

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,870
of packages and then share that code but

00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,189
I know one of the things that matters

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,899
the most to you is you really want to be

00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:58,600
able to save your time so I'm also happy

00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:02,129
to say we now have caching support built

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,129
directly into github actions

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,990
it's just as easy as going ahead and

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,610
adding a simple caching action on there

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,080
and I always feel like the proof is in

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,480
the pudding when you look at a real repo

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,430
so recently rails actually has been

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,350
using github actions and they've

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,690
switched over to now using caching so

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,430
you'll notice up here takes about six

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,560
and a half minutes once they added the

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,910
caching action now down to one and a

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,770
half minutes it's a five minute

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:31,480
reduction in their builds and this isn't

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,010
just for Ruby you can cache anything

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,779
that you need any packages that you have

00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,420
from any language binary outputs

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,950
anything like that but finally it's not

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,950
just all about packages you can also

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,750
deploy to the cloud as well so what I

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,060
did here was I created a multi cloud

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,350
deployment as you would expect I have a

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,900
couple different workflows that can

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,210
deploy to Google Amazon and Azure all

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,620
right there and then also right in my

00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,570
pull request I can actually see the

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,040
environments that these are going to as

00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,720
well so you can get one-click access

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,660
right to that environment right from the

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,370
pull request then if I go back over to

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,720
code you'll notice just like your

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,430
packages are there your pull requests

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,779
everything else that you expect you'll

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,089
notice we now have a set of environments

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,890
right there as well so I can see a

00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,300
history an activity log of all the

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,420
different deployments that I've done to

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,420
all my different environments as well so

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,680
let's jump back to the slides that gives

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,029
you a quick look at everything that

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,860
we've been doing recently you know

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,170
recently we just announced artifact

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,640
caching as well as self hosted runners

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:32,200
with arm support and x86 support as well

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,610
with packages you saw that we now have

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Gradle packages in addition to

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,850
everything else I showed and we also

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,490
have proxy supports if you want to port

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,020
your NPM r/c directly to get her

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,190
packages we'll go ahead and look on get

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,959
our packages if there's something if not

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,959
we'll fall back and grab it from NPM

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,940
directly and if you want to learn more

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,620
about what's going on with actions and

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,420
packages feel free to stay right here in

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,279
this room and Samina and I are doing a

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,460
talk immediately afterward thank you
