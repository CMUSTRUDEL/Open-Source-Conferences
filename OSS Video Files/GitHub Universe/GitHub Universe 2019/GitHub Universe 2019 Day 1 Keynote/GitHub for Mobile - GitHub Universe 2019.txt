Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 Day 1 Keynote
Description: 
	GitHub for mobile gives you the flexibility to move work forward and stay in touch with your team, wherever you are. There’s a lot you can do on GitHub that doesn’t require a complex development environment, like sharing feedback on a design discussion and reviewing a few lines of code. Now we are making these tasks easy for you to perform, no matter where you work, with a beautifully native experience.

GitHub for mobile is available now in beta for iOS—and coming soon for Android.

hi everybody i'm ryan Nystrom director

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,610
of engineering here at github and it is

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,599
so exciting to be here to share with you

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:21,180
a brand new product and that is github

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:24,090
for mobile that's right today we are

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,609
announcing new fully native apps for

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,410
Android and iOS

00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:30,779
like NAT mentioned earlier there are

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,840
over 40 million developers using github

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:37,140
today when github started over 11 years

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,600
ago everything revolved around get and

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,870
that meant you needed a computer lugged

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,690
around with you nowadays we don't just

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,469
write code we collaborate as team

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,390
members and we review each other's code

00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,539
today it's too hard to keep things

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,539
moving without a computer and that's why

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,180
we built github for mobile now you can

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,270
truly take github with you anywhere in

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,540
the world we put so much care into this

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,119
app so that it fits your workflow and

some of our favorite features the first

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,130
thing you'll see when you open github

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,530
for mobile is the new home screen here

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:23,340
you have access to all of your work at

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,150
the top we have issues and pull requests

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,549
that you created or assigned to and more

00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,970
jump into repositories and organizations

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,759
that you interact with scroll down and

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,009
you'll see a new section we call

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,650
favorites for those of you that

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,600
contribute to tons of repositories we

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,210
added this section so you can pin

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,450
favorite repositories and jump back into

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,399
them right from your home screen scroll

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,310
down a little more and you'll see all

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,799
the recent activity on issues and pull

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,680
requests that you created or commented

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,140
on it has never been easier to pick up

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,310
on your work from where you left off on

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,799
your browser at the very top of home you

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,599
can tap this plus button and file a new

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,870
issue to any repository on github we

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,299
also have a new

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,909
AB for your notifications when you're

00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:24,340
done with notifications simply swipe

00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:26,650
them away we partnered with the

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,140
notifications team here at github to

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:33,959
build a unified experience everywhere

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:37,629
and that includes iOS github.com and

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,819
Android all of the amazing features you

00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:43,900
just saw Becca demo will be available

00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:47,019
across your devices save done and so

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,819
much more you can find the notifications

00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:53,049
that you care the most about with

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:55,000
filters either by repository or all the

00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,879
custom filters that you create on

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,209
github.com they will sync and go with

00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:04,030
you across all your devices now one of

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:07,269
my favorite features are push

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:10,269
notifications we know some of you get

00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:12,099
tons of github notifications and we

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,590
don't want your phone constantly dinging

00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:18,639
and buzzing and it's too easy to miss

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,630
sometimes the really important ones we

00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,239
will send you a push notification

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:25,930
whenever somebody mentions you in an

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,799
issue pull requests or comment that way

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:32,829
you know it's important now let's drill

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,220
into a pull request here I can see

00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:39,040
everything I need to know the author

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,980
status branches and more I can scroll

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,799
down and read comments reviews and other

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,049
timeline activity I mentioned before

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,150
that these apps are all native that

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,940
includes this rich markdown rendering

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,859
you see behind me we put a ton of time

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,959
and care into this to make sure that you

00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,480
get the best possible experience on your

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,519
phone if you want to see more

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,669

I want to see what changed in this pull

00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:15,220
request I can tap into the files changed

00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:18,389
view and here view all of my code

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,389
changes in the poll

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:24,810
again this is all rendered natively

00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,229
including this gorgeous syntax

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,699
highlighting but we're not done there

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:32,879
you can also swipe up from the bottom

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:35,909

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,379
to unblock your projects while being

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:48,449
nowhere near your desk now if you want

00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,810

you can view if there are a chain if you

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,400
have approvals if there are conflicts

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,500

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,690
all of your CI or CD from anywhere in

00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,180
the world I'm telling you this app makes

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,849
me feel like I have superpowers and we

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,849
are geeking out so much over this thing

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:22,139
and speaking of geeking out I'm also

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:28,289
really excited to bring github into the

00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:31,590
dark we built an incredible dark mode

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,539
experience for both iOS and Android free

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,610
night elves out there this is way easier

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:38,250
on your eyes during those late night

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,770
hack sessions and we didn't just stop

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:47,099
with dark mode but we also built an

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:49,680
amazing iPad experience we didn't just

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:52,590
make things bigger but we built entirely

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,050
new user interfaces and custom gestures

00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,509
we even have most of the same keyboard

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,389
shortcuts you'll find on github.com

00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:05,490
this is the best github experience for

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:07,710
iPad and we designed our iPhone iPad and

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,979
Android apps to have absolute feature

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,560
parity they share a design system so

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,870
they look familiar but at the same time

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,509
we want to respect each platforms design

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:20,550
conventions these apps are built native

00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:25,080
we want to make sure they feel native

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,599
too so that's just a taste of github for

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,479
mobile there are tons more features that

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,969
I don't have time to go through github

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,590
for mobile is the best way to be

00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,320
connected

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,570
