Description: 
	GitHub for mobile gives you the flexibility to move work forward and stay in touch with your team, wherever you are. There’s a lot you can do on GitHub that doesn’t require a complex development environment, like sharing feedback on a design discussion and reviewing a few lines of code. Now we are making these tasks easy for you to perform, no matter where you work, with a beautifully native experience.

GitHub for mobile is available now in beta for iOS—and coming soon for Android.
