Title: Supporting the Community - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-14
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 Day 1 Keynote
Description: 
	Open source projects can now receive funding through GitHub Sponsors. When we launched GitHub Sponsors in May, there was an outpouring of enthusiasm for funding open source. We also received lots of great feedback, with one consistent theme in particular: the community wants a way to fund people behind projects too. So starting today, open source projects can receive funding through GitHub Sponsors!

We’re partnering with the Stanford Libraries, the Long Now Foundation, the Internet Archive, the Software Heritage Foundation, Piql, Microsoft Research, and the Bodleian Library to preserve the world’s open source code. We’ll protect this knowledge by storing multiple copies across various data formats and locations, including a very-long-term archive designed to last at least 1,000 years called the GitHub Arctic Code Vault.

About GitHub Universe:
GitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world. Sessions cover topics from team culture to open source software across industries and technologies.

I'm really excited about putting github

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,970
in your pockets and also excited about

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,830
the huge investments we're making across

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,290
nearly every aspect of the daily

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,450
experience from from get up desktops and

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,670
notifications to code search code nav

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,619
code review this is something we take

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,260
really seriously we know those little

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,279
moments those bits of friction can

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,900
really drag you down when you're

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,760
experiencing them again and again and

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,050
again and so we'd love to hear your

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,570
feedback and we're going to keep making

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,429
these types investments okay now

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,969
bringing it back to the heart of github

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,649
the open source community last May we

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,770
introduced a new program called get up

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,540
sponsors in beta and get of sponsors

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,010
allows you to financially support the

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,350
developers whose work you admire or

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,840
depend upon in the open source community

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,880
and so for an update on github sponsors

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,179
please welcome Devin zukul Devin

00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,179
[Applause]

00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:58,670
big fat

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,680
hi everyone I'm Devin the product

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,739
manager of the open source economy team

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,540
here at github we're building github

00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,450
sponsors because we envision a future

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,860
where open-source is a professional

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,509
lucrative career path these developers

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,550
maintain our critical digital

00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,570
infrastructure which is only becoming

00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:22,100
ever more important every single day

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,500
open-source developers build the tools

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,910
for the rest of us so it's our job to

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,110
build the tools that they need to

00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:32,180
succeed too as a reminder sponsors is a

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,619
new way to financially support the

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,700
developers who build the open-source

00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:40,340
software we all use everyday for example

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,410
I really admire maryadas work on the

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,640
Python core team and I used to used

00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:49,160
Python and my old job so now I can go to

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,479
her profile click the sponsor button and

00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:55,460
show her my support with vien of

00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,110
sponsors developers can sponsor each

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,009
other directly from their everyday

00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:03,380
workflows when we launched the beta just

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,350
a few months ago we also announced the

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,549
github sponsors matching fund doubling

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,830
the contributions you make to

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:13,010
open-source developers jump starts the

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,019
program meanwhile this empowers you the

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,860
members of the community to decide where

00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:21,260
the funding goes developers have already

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,720
begun doing some amazing things with

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,549
sponsors and I've been really excited to

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,799
see some of the great projects that have

00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:30,049
been in the program I was personally

00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:32,570
thrilled when Daniel Stenberg joined

00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:35,480
stop sponsors he's the founder and lead

00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:38,239
maintainer of curl with 10 billion

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,459
installations worldwide curl is one of

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,730
the most widely used software components

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:46,459
in the entire world like many developers

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,920
I've used curl for years so it was so

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,760
cool to see someone who I've depended on

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,690
for a long time

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,610
finds my work useful too I'm also

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,739
learning about loads of cool projects

00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,780
that I had never heard about before I

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,030
recently stumbled across a profile for a

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,850
guy named David who has this really cool

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,310
project and then in his profile he said

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,459
that he's been coding with his voice for

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,140
five years

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,659
and that blew my mind because I'm

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,909
someone who really likes programming and

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,400
I also use voice to text all the time

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,590
but I had never thought to code with my

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:30,450
voice so I was really excited to check

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:31,739
this project out so we've heard a lot of

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,829
great feedback from this project

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,370
throughout this entire summer and we

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:39,719
have seen some amazing things that

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,159
people have been doing and it's been

00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,859
really exciting to see people be able to

00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,739
sponsor individual developers we've also

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,599
gotten a ton of great feedback we've

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,780
gotten feedback that teams want a way to

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:56,159
sponsor their work as well so starting

00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:03,810
today teams can receive spon funding

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:05,430
through github sponsors - if your open

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,409
source project has a corporate or

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,109
nonprofit bank account you can apply to

00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:13,620
receive funds as a team rather than just

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:15,479
as an individual we're thrilled to

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,389
partner with amazing open source

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,669
projects like homebrew Numb focus Babel

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:23,099
the e-book foundation and many more as

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,830
we kick off the beta and we cannot wait

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,419
for more to join you'll see their

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,550
sponsorships when you go to any of their

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:33,060
team's projects or to their organization

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,650
page you'll see a sponsor button at the

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,389
top of the page where you'll be able to

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,280
see how to sponsor them whether it's

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,900
through github sponsors or through other

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,180
awesome funding tools like open

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,320
collective patreon tide lifts and

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,870
community bridge project level funding

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,720
is the natural next step for github

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,690
sponsors and it gets to the core of what

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,979
open source is all about we're all

00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:01,770
standing on the shoulders of giants with

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,750
new features like meet the team project

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,940
level funding reflects the deeply

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,800
collaborative way open-source is made

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,509
this is still just the beginning and we

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,820
are listening closely for more of your

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,219
feedback we're committed to helping the

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,229
community fund developers who work in

00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:20,510
open source and we're excited to keep

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:23,210
building new ways

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:26,150
make that happen so head to github.com

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,950
flash sponsors to get started thank you

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,830
all and thank you especially to the

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,020
open-source developers you are the heart

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,810
of the open-source community and we

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:42,280
couldn't do any of this without you

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:44,420
back to you now right Thank You Devin

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,130
we're really excited about sponsored

00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,720
projects and I'm really proud of the

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,610
work that we're doing at github to try

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,280
to help open source communities continue

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,170
to thrive now we've been talking this

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,600
morning about the importance of open

00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,190
source but to put it in context and

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,040
maybe a larger historical context I

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,860
wanted to tell you a short story this is

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,320
Florence in Italy and this is the dome

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,270
of the Florence Cathedral it's the

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,280
famous Duomo that was created at the

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,320
height of the Italian Renaissance and

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,540
the story of how it was built is

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,000
interesting at the beginning of the 15th

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,880
century in 1418 the leaders of Florence

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,430
set up a contest to find a builder who

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,920
could create this beautiful dome and at

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,260
the time no one knew how to construct a

00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,670
dome of the scale because no such dome

00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,490
had been created actually since the

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,980
Roman Empire since nearly 1500 years

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,890
earlier that engineering knowledge that

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,810
came from antiquity had been lost but

00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,480
then a man who is named Filippo

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,730
Brunelleschi who lived in Florence and

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,460
wanted to win the contest took a trip to

00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,740
Rome and he went there to study the

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,260
Roman ruins and some of the ancient

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,670
texts from Vitruvius and others to

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,860
rediscover these ancient engineering

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:58,430
techniques and he learned from them and

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,440
he was inspired by them and used what he

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,830
learned in the construction of this

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,840
beautiful cathedral that ancient Roman

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,350
knowledge that he was able to find in

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,870
Rome helps power the Italian Renaissance

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,280
now when we think about our world today

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,740
the knowledge required to build a dome

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,990
is not that different from the knowledge

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,640
of how to build a container or how to

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,400
create an accurate machine learning

00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,220
model or to make an app that works for a

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,030
billion people there's this long history

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,640
on earth of humanity where big things

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,230
happened without software you know

00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,440
algebra was invented

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:41,340
gun powder was discovered empires rose

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,720
and fell and that's over nothing big

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,660
will ever happen again

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,880
without software it's almost crazy or

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,680
outlandish to say it but but human

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,290
progress actually depends on open source

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,210
so the code you write is important it

00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,490
matters and it should be preserved and

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,950
so it github we decided we should do

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,080
something and to be honest we might have

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,220
gotten a little carried away but let's

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,220
just see for yourself

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,340
deep in the Arctic Circle

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:22,240
in archipelago covered in ice

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:26,319
small barred home to the northernmost

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,620
town in the world to thousands of polar

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,620
bears

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,349
and it is here you can find the global

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:41,080
Seed Vault millions of seeds have been

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:44,320
sent here from across the globe first

00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,800
secure long-term storage in cold and dry

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,290
rock vaults just down the road is a

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,310
decommissioned coal mine that has taken

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,310
on new life

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:06,750
this is where we will protect open

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,750
source software for future generations

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:16,339
deep within the permafrost layer which

00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:17,959
can stretch up to 400 meters thick we

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:21,739
will store the world's open-source

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:24,019
software on silver halide film the data

00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:27,110
is encoded on frames with eight point

00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:32,149
eight million pixels each and designed

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:34,579
to last over 1,000 years in our initial

00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,589
deposit we archive thousands of the

00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:39,339
world's most dependent on open-source

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,339
projects

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:52,190
the work of hundreds of thousands of

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,190
developers from around the world

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,130
we will return next spring

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,120
during the perpetual light of the

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,120
Midnight Sun

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:14,330
to deposit every active public

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:18,940
repository on github for safekeeping in

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,940
the github our dick code vault

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:30,920
all right Wow a little bit crazy we know

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,410
so two weeks ago we traveled the

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,990
Svalbard to deposit the most popular and

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,240
most dependent upon open-source projects

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,880
into the github Arctic code vault and

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,060
they're there now and the beauty of this

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,460
place is just stunning it's so remote

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,250
there's fewer than 3,000 people that

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,590
live in Svalbard but we actually met a

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,410
number of github users they're using

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,450
open source software to drive scientific

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,030
instruments and interpret their data to

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,680
study the aurora borealis and I think

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,990
one of them is here somewhere Katie

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,820
wherever you are and so it turns out

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,720
software is everywhere even this crazy

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,640
remote place runs on open source and so

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,830
this is our code vault and to make sure

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,260
that your code is included all you need

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:18,140
to do is have an active public repo by

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,360
February 2nd of next year we will

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,000
snapshot every repo that's been active

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,270
in the prior year on that date and store

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,300
it in Svalbard now this effort was

00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,460
inspired by many people and especially

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,600
inspired by generations of people who

00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:38,210
have made archiving their life's work

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,010
archivists are so important and so this

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,480
actually the github Arctic code vault is

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,090
just one piece of the work we're doing

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,500
to preserve and protect open source for

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,290
developers who are here today and for

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,150
developers yet to come the broader

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,460
effort we called the github archive

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,140
program and I'm really happy to announce

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,790
that we've partnered with many of the

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,770
people and the organizations that

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,170
inspired us who are dedicated to

00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,630
preserving knowledge to make sure that

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,550
we store the actual code in different

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,100
locations and different storage media

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,380
around the world lots of copies keep

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,300
stuff safe and so a few of our partners

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,660
are actually here today the Internet

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,800
Archive

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,350
talking about how the wayback machine

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,690
will give you full access to github the

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,420
Arctic world archive software Heritage

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,580
Foundation long now Stanford and

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,470
Microsoft Research which is developing

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,540
project silica which is a 10,000 year

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:31,000
storage medium so they'll be here on the

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,000
