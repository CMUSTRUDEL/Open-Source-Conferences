Title: Supporting the Community - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-14
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 Day 1 Keynote
Description: 
	Open source projects can now receive funding through GitHub Sponsors. When we launched GitHub Sponsors in May, there was an outpouring of enthusiasm for funding open source. We also received lots of great feedback, with one consistent theme in particular: the community wants a way to fund people behind projects too. So starting today, open source projects can receive funding through GitHub Sponsors!

We’re partnering with the Stanford Libraries, the Long Now Foundation, the Internet Archive, the Software Heritage Foundation, Piql, Microsoft Research, and the Bodleian Library to preserve the world’s open source code. We’ll protect this knowledge by storing multiple copies across various data formats and locations, including a very-long-term archive designed to last at least 1,000 years called the GitHub Arctic Code Vault.
