00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:47,950
please welcome the CEO of github NAT

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,950
Freedman all right good morning

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,070

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,800
fantastic to be here with all of you

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,809
today in beautiful San Francisco I want

extend a special welcome to all the open

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,060
source contributors and maintain herbs

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,799
for all the work that you do let's give

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,409
these folks a big round of applause we

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,850
owe them a lot all right well it's an

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,369
exciting time to be together because

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,250
2019 has been an incredible year for the

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,560
github community in fact now there are

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,460
over 40 million developers using github

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,319
to build software 40 million and more

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,899
developers are choosing github every day

00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,080
than ever before just in the last year

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,580
over 10 million new developers joined

00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,220
github and started contributing to

00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,170
projects on github we also have more

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,349
enterprise teams using github than ever

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,429
before with more than 3 million

00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,649
organizations using github including

00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:00,989
more than half of the Fortune 100 and

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,599
these developers are all incredibly busy

00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:05,819
every day developers around the world

00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,789
make millions of contributions to

00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:12,180
projects on github and you can see them

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:16,200
here this is a visualization that we

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:19,680
created of 30 days of contributions to

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,410
github.com and on this globe each little

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,540
pulse of light each dot represents a

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,629
separate contribution to open source

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,519
made by one person somewhere on earth

00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,530
it's kind of an amazing thing to look at

00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,209
and think about because there's all

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,010
these people from all around the world

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,400
different locations with different

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,739
backgrounds who come together to solve

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,330
problems together and maybe in many

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,860
cases the only thing that they have in

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,290
common is that they don't want to solve

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,480
the same problem they do it together in

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,680
public and so the work of all these

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,739
people is the reason we're all here

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,830
today we owe a lot to that in fact today

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,019
ninety nine percent of all new software

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,120
projects have open source dependencies

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,750
so whether you're working in a big

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,210
company or in a startup

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,970
or if you're a scientist or a researcher

00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,250
or a student you rely on open source and

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,390
you rely on the people who build it all

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,970
around the world strangers that you

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,500
don't know every line of code that you

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,200
write is actually built on the work of

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,670
these thousands of other people and so

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,640
you kind of think about it this way when

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,340
you import a new open-source library

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,630
into your into your source code

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,400
you're not just adding code to your

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,040
project in a way you're actually

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,020
extending your team right each time you

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,970
type import you invite a whole new group

00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,550
of developers to your team and you

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,110
actually give them commit access to your

00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,850
production in a way you give them access

00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,400
to what you're doing thousands of

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,620
strangers but when we think about

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,530
software development these days we still

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,280
have this this image the stereotype of

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:55,000
the solitary developer right alone in a

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,670
dark room probably introverted them in

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,920
the code them on the screen you sort of

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,610
put slide pizza under the door and code

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,230
comes out gets uploaded to the cloud but

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,720
in reality software development is

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,239
deeply collaborative we all rely on this

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,519
giant global team of developers to do

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,440
our work it's it's in a way it's the

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,419
world's biggest team sport we're all a

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,350
part of this interconnected community

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:23,080
and this collaborative model is actually

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,820
better right because it doesn't matter

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,070
how big your company is how many

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,110
developers you employ no single company

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,660
can out-compete the millions of

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,700
open-source developers out there working

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,040
in public and so we all have to work

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,700
together and that's why we can say today

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,640
that open-source is one we should just

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,040
take a moment to recognize this where we

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,140
are this world we've created over the

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,220
last 25 years open-source is gone from

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,260
this academic almost fringe activity to

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,720
powering the infrastructure of modern

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,260
civilization if you told someone 20

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,610
years ago that by 2020 the dominant

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,530
paradigm for software development would

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,390
be strangers volunteering for free

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,160
online and that everyone would just

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,110
download their code and put it in almost

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,760
every product like they'd say you're

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,320
crazy that's not gonna happen software

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,450
is written by big professional companies

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,560
but that's the world we're in now every

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,060
time you pull your phone out of your

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,580
pocket to use an app

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,640
or visit a website or in many cases just

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,800
if you have a Nissan or a GM or many

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,780
other cars start your car yeah

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,450
open-source is part of making that

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,980
happen and so this is the world we built

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,240
in it and it's our responsibility to

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,210
take care of it because it's only going

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,850
to get bigger in fact running our

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,920
numbers we predict by 2025 there will be

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,410
over a hundred million developers on

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,130
github and the complexity of these

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:47,770
ecosystems scales with Metcalfe's law so

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,480
it's going to be a big crazy world we

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,090
have to build the systems the processes

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,700
the norms now to support all of that and

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,990
so today at this conference we're gonna

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,900
talk about the work we're doing at

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,760
github in three areas we're gonna talk

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,560
about how github helps developers take

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,500
their work all the way to production

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,330
from code to cloud about the work that

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,580
we're doing on the core experience of

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,350
writing code and collaborating on github

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,880
and we're gonna talk about the

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,530
investments were making in the continued

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,920
success and prosperity of the open

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,870
source community tomorrow morning we had

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,970
a little too much to fit into today's

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,230
keynote but tomorrow morning we're gonna

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,630
be talking about the work we're doing to

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,300
secure software development the open

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,650
source supply chain how can we make it

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,140
hub not just the best place to produce

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,390
open source code but the safest place to

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,130
consume it and I think you're gonna

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,480
really find that talk interesting so

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,890
don't miss it you'll also get to hear

00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,890
