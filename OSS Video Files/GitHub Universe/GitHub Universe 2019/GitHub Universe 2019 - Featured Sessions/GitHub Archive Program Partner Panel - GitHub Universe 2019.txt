[Music]

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,410
good afternoon everyone and welcome to

00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,110
this next set of talks about the state

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,090
of the art of long-term thinking and of

00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,800
long-term archiving my name is nicolas

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,590
paul reiser whit's i'm the director of

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,860
development at the long now foundation

00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:35,300
and i currently have the curious task of

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,550
condensing the next and last 10,000

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,930
years into the next eight minutes so

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,610
please bear with me if it seems like I'm

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,809
talking a little quickly I've got a lot

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,820
of cool stuff I want to walk you guys

00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:46,129
through and I'm excited to get through

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,010
all of it today so let's see if we got

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,320
this perfect so the long now foundation

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:53,930
is a non-profit here in San Francisco

00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,089
California that was founded in 1996 with

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,309
the hope of getting people to think more

00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:00,260
seriously about the long term so for us

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,260
in this case this is the next and last

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,239
10,000 years of human civilization so as

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,010
opposed to the short now of this

00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,659
conference or of this semester this

00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,070
election cycle this business quarter

00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,110
we're trying to get people to think

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,180
about this 20,000 year narrative that we

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,620
call the long now and one of the

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,479
advantages of this framework is that

00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,120
putting yourself in the middle of a

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,940
20,000 year temporal window like this

00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,220
means you're the inheritors of 10,000

00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,740
years of art culture science and

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,300
technology but it also means you're in

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,460
the middle of the story and at the

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,200
beginning of the next 10,000 years at an

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,600
extraordinarily leveraged point where

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,220
you have a lot of responsibility to be a

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,840
good ancestor to the next 400

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,100
generations of humans that are coming

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,770
after you but of course most people

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,570
aren't really thinking that far out and

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,070
that's where this guy comes in this is

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,750
Danny Hillis who some of you might know

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,090
as one of the people who was responsible

00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,250
for inventing massive parallel computing

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,220
and like so many technologists of his

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,780
age Danny realized in the 90s that the

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,360
year 2000 where they had always thought

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,040
of the future being being kind of out

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,540
there by the year 2000 that's when all

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,040
this stuff was gonna happen it was gonna

00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,810
come and go in the blink of an eye and

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,000
we didn't really have a replacement

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,830
symbol for the future something to get

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,690
people to inspire people to think long

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,670
term and so Danny being something of a

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,680
computer geek thought hey I should make

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,959
a mechanical clock the size of a

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,209
mountain that'll keep good time for the

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,069
next 10,000 years and will act as an

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,629
icon and a symbol for long-term thinking

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,030
in the future the same way that the

00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:28,850
Pyramids at Giza act as a symbol of the

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,170
past and so this is kind of a wild idea

00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,130
he started telling some friends of his

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,750
one of the people that got really

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,640
interested in it was Brian you know a

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,950
British musician of some repute who's

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,720
known for being a band member of Roxy

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,700
Music but then also inventing ambient

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,170
music and Brian realized that if you're

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,120
gonna go to the trouble of building a

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,770
mythic clock on this scale you should

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,600
probably also have a mythic Bell chime

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,580
and so Danny and Brian worked together

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,140
to hack out an algorithm that would

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,110
ensure that every visitor to the clock

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,850
on every single day in the next 10,000

00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,890
years would hear a Bell chime that no

00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,239
human being had ever heard before and no

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,560
human being would ever hear again so

00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,440
that's about three point six five

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,319
million unique Bell chime sequences that

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,030
are programmed into the clock and that

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,350
clock is now currently under

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,269
construction inside of this mountain in

00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,549
West Texas they've been building this

00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:15,769
thing for most of my adult life and it's

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,910
still under construction right now rumor

00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,920
has it it might be done within my

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,360
lifetime but we've never actually

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,920
offered up a completion date for it but

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,750
I did bring a really cool video to share

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,980
with you really quickly about some of

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,080
the installation work that went on with

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,549
the Bell the chime winder or sorry the

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,840
the Bell chime generator and the clock

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:35,110
winder last year and it does have some

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,110
sound

00:03:51,570 --> 00:04:28,490
[Music]

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,390
so the clock is currently under

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,980
construction but that's not the only way

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,540
we can get people to think long term for

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,040
some people the clock resonates and for

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,090
other people there's other ways we

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,130
should be reaching them and so we have a

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,480
host of other projects one of the other

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,670
personalities that got involved with the

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,170
long now foundation early on is Stuart

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,650
brand here a counterculture figure

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,060
American author started the well

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,990
published the Whole Earth Catalog Stuart

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,520
thought that if you're going to go to

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,960
the trouble to bury a clock for somebody

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,490
to find in a few thousand years you

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,680
might want to put something with the

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,330
clock that would get them inspired about

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,530
disguting this discovery so what kind of

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,360
cultural things could you put there

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,920
mostly he was thinking about a library

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,390
he was thinking of something where we'd

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,980
have all the books that you would need

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,600
to jumpstart civilization so

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,120
specifications for how to make good

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,890
steel Socratic dialogue Shakespearean

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,780
sonnets the whole works you want to put

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,100
this together and have it there for

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,030
somebody to find with the clock but of

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,320
course you get into these language

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,700
questions really quickly when you start

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,650
thinking about a project like this which

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,260
is you know do you put Bohr heyse in the

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,850
library in Spanish do you put Dostoevsky

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,380
in the library in Russian or do you just

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,570
put the whole thing in English or the

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,680
whole thing in Mandarin what we start

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,000
asking these questions about what kind

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,650
of languages people are gonna speak in

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,030
the future and one of the languages are

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,800
not gonna speak in the future is one

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,300
that's gone extinct so the Rosetta

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,980
project was one of our early projects

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,960
that was designed to collect data and

00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,760
documentation on as many languages

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,870
spoken on the planet as we could and

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,970
when I say documentation I mean

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,430
dictionaries grammars vocabulary lists

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,720
parallel text translations Genesis or

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,190
the Universal Declaration of Human

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,350
Rights and then we worked with Lawrence

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,300
Berkeley National Labs to use a focused

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,040
gallium ion beam that can etch nickel

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,080
disks like this one at the seven

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,400
nanometer scale so the disk you've seen

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,860
behind you is a little bit bigger than

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,140
your hand and it has about 15,000 pages

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,270
of language documentation edged into it

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,090
of course this is an homage to the

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,160
original rosetta stone and each page is

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,110
about five human hairs wide so rather

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,820
than actually encoding data digitally

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,710
we've actually just have a human eye

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,940
readable format it's very small but a

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,710
jeweler's loupe will get you there about

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,020
a hundred times magnification you can

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,630
read the whole thing in 2016 with the

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,700
help of the European Space Agency we

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,320
were able to land one of these archives

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,270
on comet 67p

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,280
and then we the summer we landed one on

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,480
the loop of the lunar surface as well we

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,800
also have a bunch all around the planet

00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,030
because in archiving there's this idea

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,430
called LOX loc

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,650
KSS which stands for lots of copies keep

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,880
stuff safe and so we have about a

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,280
hundred of these all around the globe

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,140
and of course if you're going all the

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,430
work to protect languages the question

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,680
is well could you protect and preserve

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,080
species could you use current genomic

00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,340
technology to D extinct species that

00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,870
have gone extinct like the woolly

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,010
mammoth or the passenger pigeon

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,290
so we have the revive and restore

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,790
project which is working on that we also

00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,290
invite experts to come talk about their

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,630
work in the context of the next and last

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,580
10,000 years once a month here in San

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,260
Francisco here are some of the people

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,030
that have talked for us just in the last

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,580
couple of years but we have about 230

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,870
talks now at this point of course

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,850
there's a membership group around long

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,620
now has about 11,000 members across 60

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,120
countries and then we decided we needed

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,410
a physical place to congregate so we

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,450
turned our headquarters in Fort Mason

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,430
center just down the street into the

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,540
interval where we have talks we have

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,710
some prototype parts of the clock of

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,090
course we have that library I was

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,800
talking about and it's also an

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,720
award-winning cocktail bar we regularly

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,890
grace a number of top 10 list in San

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,900
Francisco and across the United States

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,820
and the idea being that you would go

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,590
with a friend go have a cocktail in this

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,180
unusual bar surrounded by unusual

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,190
objects and you'd ask yourself the

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,750
really important questions from being a

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,250
good ancestor about the next 10,000

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,350
years like how can we be better

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,360
ancestors of course you know on long

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,400
timescales anticipating future need

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,470
becomes very difficult it's hard to tell

00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,490
what people in the future gonna need and

00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,880
how you're gonna get it to them when

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,650
they need it

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,850
so archiving projects like the one that

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,260
was announced this morning and like the

00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,060
other ones you're gonna hear about today

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,460
these archiving projects are their best

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,930
bet we've got at providing future people

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,480
with the resources they might need

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,550
possibly and so we're very excited to be

00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,700
part of the advisory team for the github

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,470
archive program and I'm very excited to

00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,720
introduce our next speakers which are

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,290
Patricia offline and Ben dick bride of

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,290
pickle

00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,099
good afternoon everyone so we are pickle

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,959
from Norway we're also the founders

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,509
behind the article archive that you saw

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,560
this morning so today we are gonna talk

00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:44,139
about our approach to the challenge of

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,940
of taking care of information into the

00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:48,190
perpetuity and how we use simple means

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,279
of technology to ensure the access of

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,139
that data so what you see here this is

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,199
our claim to fame this is our core

00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:57,880
competence it's digital time capsule we

00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:00,490
call it the pickle film so it's an

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,250
offline storage medium it's what we call

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,350
right ones read many mediums so it's

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,720
information cannot be hacked the

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,689
information cannot be tampered or taken

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,009
away changed on that storage medium when

00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,420
we started out we wanted to design a

00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,670
storage medium that could last for

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,310
centuries and even thousands of years

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,319
and coming from the film industry we saw

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,060
that while some properties with the film

00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:24,100
knowing that the history of film is more

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,720
than hundred years and had very good

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,759
characteristics on how to keep

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,769
information for the long term and so

00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,120
what we did is to do that with digital

00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,279
content and to be able to put that on

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,990
the robust medium so there's a few

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,420
important aspects so in terms of

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,519
authenticity so in the digital world

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,470
today with deep fakes and similar

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,660
technique of emerging technologies how

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,779
can we really ensure authenticity in the

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,370
thousand year perspective so from our

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:50,740
point of view we think the best way

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,209
would be to keep the the true original

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,829
of that of that file and keep it on a

00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,839
very long-term storage medium not

00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:02,230
migrating that information not changing

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,220
it from formative format in order to do

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,230
that we also need to be able to

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,120
future-proof to ensure that we can

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,529
access and read back that information in

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,810
the long term perspective and we're

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,550
doing that by using opens an open source

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,319
software and putting that documentation

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,699
on the storage medium itself and that

00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:17,680
brings us to kind of the most important

00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,870
part that we say that is self-contained

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,759
so we are putting all the information

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,620
about the decoding software about the

00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,819
file formal specifications about

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,439
everything you need to be able to

00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:29,139
retrieve the information in future in

00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:31,360
both a machine readable language but

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,360
also in a human readable language so

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,730
kind of gives the future use users the

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,199
opportunity without us knowing kind of

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,730
the the knowledge that we have in the

00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:40,480
future the software or the computing

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,730
platforms

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,020
still the opportunity to have several

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,610
options on how to read back the

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:48,040
information so it could be like a

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,380
low-tech visual proxy so you can just

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,350
read information by using light it could

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,090
be that you're using the source code to

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,370
reconstruct a decoder for a file format

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,620
that is that is the knowledge is lost

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,630
you can even we even include the file

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,210
formal specification to help that

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,690
process if the compiling of the source

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:09,400
code is difficult in the new system and

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:12,300
we are now also including a virtual

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,400
machine to help the process of the

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:18,310
recoating and rendering of the files for

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,020
the most used common of file formats for

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:22,690
preservation today to make that

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,060
retrieval process faster and more cost

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,490
efficient so what you see here this is

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,140
the storage medium so you see there's a

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,690
visual frame on top and then there's the

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,710
digital frame at the bottom so we're

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,990
using an optical readable 2d barcode so

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,060
we have developed a very flexible

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,250
barcode that we called the boxing the

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,750
boxing library so this is written in the

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,510
C language it's open-source and

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,390
published in our repo on github so the

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:51,670
idea of using the C language was that we

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,340
has been used for a long time it's quite

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,280
simple and very fast and it also doesn't

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,170
have a lot of dependencies around it at

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,550
the same time to be able to kind of so

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,170
we are dispersing the files through a

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,940
lot of these frames but they're able to

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,520
kind of put that together and organize

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,620
it we also developed something in we

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,780
call the archival file system so the

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,060
archival file system is also open source

00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,820
written in the C language and it's and

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,460
it has a table of content which makes it

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,010
possible to understand about the the

00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,140
visual file and a digital file and it

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,210
understands the file format and can

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,810
point directly to that specific file

00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:30,850
format decoder which is stored on the

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,620
medium for the retrieval at the same

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,230
time we're storing this table of content

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,810
both in a human readable and a machine

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,640
readable format so we think this

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,700
combination of the visual and the

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,220
digital really creates an extreme

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,580
resilience to the long term of the

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,220
storage what you see here is so we're

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,250
also including metadata representation

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,020
or position information in both formats

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,260
so what you see here is what we put on

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,910
the on the deposit for the get up in

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,500
this case that could be a mission

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,750
statement it's a file format

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,000
specification of deflate and gzip which

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,070
was used in this deposit to store the

00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,160
source code on our storage medium in the

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,470
article archive and then so how can we

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,510
retrieve the data so today you can use

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,260
addicted scanner so what you see here on

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,770
the on the right side is the pickle

00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,750
reader

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:25,270
so this scans the frames and then

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,980
convert it back to the original file but

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,990
we also wanted to create the opportunity

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,050
to get the information back which is the

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,640
most simple means so by us as we've seen

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,070
kind of including the information about

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,660
the decoding software the the archival

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,210
file system and the file form

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,740
specifications you are able to get back

00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,870
the information just by using a

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,570
magnifying glass some kind of capturing

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,950
device like a camera and a computer in

00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,720
the future to retrieve that information

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,860
and if you want to understand more about

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,460
the software tools that were using

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,230
please check out our repo on the on the

00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,320
github site so now I'm just giving it

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:02,500
over to appreciate so you saw in the

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,350
video this morning the github optic code

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,720
vaults is set inside our vault which is

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,180
called the Arctic world archive it's

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,980
located up on the remote Norwegian

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,790
Arctic island of Svalbard and it was

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,500
opened in 2017 so quite young the vault

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,120
itself is inside the decommissioned mine

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,950
you saw it on the video this morning and

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,839
the region is D Miller is a

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,520
demilitarized area regulated by an

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,370
international treaty making it a super

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,380
safe and politically stable area it's

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:35,770
not somewhere that's affected by natural

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:38,710
disasters and it offers the best

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:42,490
conditions for storage of film type

00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:45,130
medium or a polymer-based medium so the

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,950
vault itself is cold dark dry low and

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,960
oxygen and which is great because that

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,990
means no electricity to store this data

00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,600
for perpetuity for hundreds of thousands

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,030
of years making it super sustainable

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,589
which is really important and also

00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:03,760
actually extends the life of the film as

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:06,130
well and to be able to accurately

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,520
predict how this medium will survive

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,770
over time we've done a number

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,620
different testing on it so the key one

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,600
being accelerated aging which uses

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,870
temperature to simulate the aging

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,760
process it's an ISO standardized process

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,140
and it takes a really long time so we're

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,399
seven to eight years into the testing

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,529
process of this and we've passed this

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,930
seven hundred and fifty year mark for

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:29,360
read-back if it was stored at room

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,250
temperature so that dramatically

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,839
increases the colder and the drier the

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,200
conditions so we can say very

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,149
confidently that in other their data is

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,190
gonna survive a thousand years at least

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:42,140
two thousand years we're gonna continue

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:46,850
testing see how far we get but we've

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,709
proven right back so far we've also

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,330
conducted numerous stress tests both in

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:52,760
the medium and they differ frames to see

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,310
how it behaves after lots and lots of

00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,470
reading how it handles where scratches

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,320
we've even exposed it to quite a lot of

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,820
radiation just to see how it went and

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,529
it's proven to be an incredibly robust

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,990
and resilient medium which is great

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,870
because then we've got a very safe and

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,620
secure place in the Arctic Circle and

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:15,680
we've also got a really robust medium

00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,540
perfect combination so since the Arctic

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,329
world archive was opened in 2017 we've

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,930
had more than 30 global deposits with

00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:27,130
more happening all the time

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:29,480
quiet a lot of institutions want to make

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,700
deposits of their valuable donor

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,860
safeguard their piece of world memory

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,140
while we build a nice picture of the

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,360
whole so this is growing all the time

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,399
unicef this week announced that they're

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,110
making a deposit we've got the Vatican

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,579
Library the European Space Agency the

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,640
Norwegian National Museum National

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:48,020
Archives from several countries

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,420
corporate institutions contemporary

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,100
visual sound art scientific

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,529
breakthroughs political histories and

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:57,079
many many others and as I said growing

00:16:54,529 --> 00:17:01,209
all the time so it's an absolute

00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:05,150
pleasure for us to to formally welcome

00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:07,760
github and its archival program into the

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,880
Arctic world archive as digital

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:16,790
preservation enthusiasts and open source

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:18,589
nuts we we think it's really crucial to

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,209
have open source as a core part of

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,990
preservation for perpetuity and it's

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,329
it's

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,809
the premise that we've built all of our

00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:28,669
technology on so and it's you know it's

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:31,970
a nice to be able to say that as we've

00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:35,690
published our code for how to retrieve

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,950
and read back data and github now github

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,809
is depositing their source code in the

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,629
octa-core tacos a really lovely circle

00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:43,879
so yeah to finish off we're just like to

00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:45,619
formally welcome github in today at

00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,539
aquatic have community it's the first

00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:51,889
software deposit which is a really

00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:55,039
unique and valuable part of of world

00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:56,809
heritage so thank you please give a

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,679
round of applause to Patricia and Ben

00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,379
dick of pickle

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,270
next up we have Johann Stefanovic of

00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:09,759
project silica from Microsoft Research

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:12,019
[Applause]

00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:16,419
researcher Microsoft and I'm gonna talk

00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:19,070
about project silica so last week at

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:22,100
ignite Satya talked about our

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,279
collaboration with Warner Brothers

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:30,129
whereby we stored the classic 1978 film

00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:32,119
Superman inside a piece of glass and our

00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:33,980
partnership with Warner Brothers really

00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:36,440
reinforced to us the importance of the

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,720
so called third copy of your data so the

00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,850
third copy is essentially a copy of your

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,919
data with the property that if all else

00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,769
fails you want to have the guarantee

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:48,289
that you can always go back and reread

00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:51,919
and read your third copy and be able to

00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:53,809
safely recover your data and of course

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,159
there are a lot of different types of

00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:59,799
data for which we want this property

00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,210
this morning that Friedman talked about

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,639
the importance of preserving source code

00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:07,039
right think about the millions of people

00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:09,320
years worth of developer time and effort

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,730
that's gone into building and debugging

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,740
the systems that we have today right

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,350
it's a legacy that we want to be able to

00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,269
preserve for future generations right as

00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,490
well as you know Wikipedia the Internet

00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:21,289
Archive effectively the sum total of the

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,509
world's knowledge of course there are

00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:25,429
many other business areas where this is

00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,960
also crucially important and on a

00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,480
personal level where I think about the

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,690
number of photos and videos you have on

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,710
your phone of cherished moments from

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,790
your life that you want to be able to

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,290
safely pass

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:40,850
your descendants now the bad news is

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,400
that existing storage technologies are

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,100
inadequate for this the vast majority of

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,140
data today is stored on hard disk drives

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,240
and tapes which are magnetic media and

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,130
the problem is that over time the media

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,560
degrades and so you get failure modes

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:57,350
like bit rot or in the case of optical

00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,700
disks media rot and this is example of

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:02,240
what that actually looks like so this is

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,390
a laser disc from 1986 that was storing

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,760
the BBC doomsday project which was a

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:10,160
census of the UK with a bunch of other

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,500
information this was supposed to be sort

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,720
of future-proof way of storing this

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,340
information forever and it's now in the

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,690
digital obsolescence section of the

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,520
Cambridge computer laboratory and so the

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,860
way to counteract this problem with

00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,990
existing technologies is to essentially

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,270
copied the data over every few years to

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,160
a new generation to a new device from

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,480
the same type of storage technology and

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,280
of course the problem with this the

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,600
problem with this refreshing of data

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,560
every few years is that there's a huge

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,840
financial cost associated with keeping

00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,290
long-lived data around and increasingly

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,790
as the amount of data we have grows

00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,470
there's an increasing energy cost as

00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,960
well to doing this which of course is

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,160
not great given the other environmental

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,390
challenges that we're facing with

00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,850
dealing with right now

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,300
and so in projects silica what we aimed

00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:03,230
to do is to create a storage technology

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,820
that has that hat that attempt solves

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,770
these problems and gives you the

00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,410
guarantee that you're gonna be able to

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:12,050
store your data safely for thousands of

00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:14,360
years and then we want to leverage the

00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,740
economies of scale of the cloud to be

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,510
able to offer this as a service to

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:24,740
businesses and consumers and the media

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:27,650
for this is glass and I'm not talking

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,990
about any sort of exotic type of glass

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:33,350
this is a this is it's it's a pure form

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:36,650
of glass called fused fused silica or

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,870
quartz glass but its raw material is

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:42,170
sand it's very low cost to manufacture

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,360
at scale and it has a lifetime of tens

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,190
to hundreds of thousands of years and

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,690
it's a very resilient media an I'm gonna

00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,610
show you in a second exactly what I mean

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,309
by that

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:55,130
so this is a warm media right once read

00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,980
many and it's very persistent so what I

00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:00,320
mean by that is that in order to write

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,779
data what we do is we make permanent

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,880
changes to the physical structure of the

00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:07,759
media and so what that means is that

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,759
once data is written in it there is it

00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,840
does not degrade or it doesn't change

00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,929
physical structure in any way so there's

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,190
no bit rot there's no media decay which

00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:19,279
means that we don't need to scrub the

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,960
media and of course the consequence of

00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,570
all of these properties is that we can

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,700
now afford to leave the data in situ so

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,070
once written we don't have to keep

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,230
moving it over every few years to a new

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,049
device which means that we don't have an

00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,379
accumulated energy and find a financial

00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:39,590
cost and in addition to that we are less

00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:41,570
prone to suffering from data loss while

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,450
copying due to hardware or software bugs

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,500
so I'm sure if you talk to any archivist

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,940
that will tell you that this is one of

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,070
the main concerns is that when you copy

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,529
data over often what you end up with is

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,860
bugs in either and hardware or software

00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:56,330
that causes you data loss so I want to

00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,480
share with you a quick video to kind of

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,100
show you just how resilient of a media

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,419
glasses and kind of give you a sense for

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,590
why it's important to understand these

00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,299
things from an operational perspective

00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:09,230
in terms of how you might use this in a

00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:11,179
data center so water and humidity has

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,519
traditionally been a very big problem

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:16,070
for archival media in particular

00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,460
ferromagnetic media as you can see here

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:23,990
glass is waterproof we can it is

00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:25,789
resistant to electromagnetic to magnetic

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,429
radiation which means that an event of

00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:31,070
things like solar flares or solar storms

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:33,350
your data is going to be safe because we

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:36,080
store the data inside the bulk of the

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,909
glass material that means that surface

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,730
level scratches or physical interactions

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:42,919
are not really a problem for us

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:46,309
and you can even bake it and you can

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,110
even use a flamethrower on it but we

00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:49,840
didn't have time to be able to include

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,759
that in this video

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,230
DeeDee the takeaway there though is that

00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:55,879
you know if you have a fire in your data

00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,909
center for example you're right you can

00:23:55,879 --> 00:24:01,399
put out the fire with water even in the

00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,269
worst case you know you can always

00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:04,609
replace your elec

00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:06,080
tronics but at least you have the peace

00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,539
of mind and the guarantee that your data

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,929
is going to be safe so how does this

00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:14,209
actually work well in order to write we

00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,940
use a femtosecond laser so this is a

00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:19,489
pulsed laser the pulses are in the order

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,049
of hundreds of femtoseconds so that's 10

00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:23,749
to the minus 15 seconds just for

00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:26,330
reference and what we do is we focus the

00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:28,309
laser beam inside the bulk of the glass

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,049
material and at the point of focus we

00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:31,759
get these little voxel nano structures

00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:35,239
that are made of these parallel nano

00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:37,279
planes and by changing the amount of

00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:40,339
energy that we put in we can control the

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,229
depth or the strength of these voxels

00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:43,639
and by modulating the polarization we

00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:45,919
can change the orientation of these

00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:48,499
voxels and so these are two dimensions

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,919
across which we can encode multiple bits

00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:55,159
of data and of course we can write the

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,889
voxels in XY 2-d planes and then we can

00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:00,739
stack them in Z across hundreds of

00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:04,039
layers and so in a piece of glass you're

00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:05,719
really getting volumetric storage

00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:09,109
because you can effectively fill the

00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:12,649
entire piece of glass with data so this

00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:14,889
is a video of one of the right heads in

00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:17,899
our lab back in Cambridge in the UK

00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:19,099
writing Superman well you can't see

00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,589
anything because it's being written and

00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:24,709
infrared but you can see the glass

00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:26,089
substrate moving back and forth as the

00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:28,700
data is being written and you can see

00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:30,529
the seven different beam lines and the

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,829
little round things at the top that hold

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:39,229
the lenses that focus the laser light

00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:41,929
inside the glass substrate so to read it

00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:43,629
you use a totally different technology

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:48,259
you don't use a laser you use

00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:51,679
polarization microscopy and so the light

00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:53,929
source for that is a simple LED and the

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,619
readhead effectively has optical

00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:59,950
elements to focus the light to focus the

00:25:57,619 --> 00:26:02,749
light on the desired sector and

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,609
polarization components so now we get to

00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:07,639
how do voxels actually store data

00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:09,859
so when polarized light passes through a

00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:11,929
voxel the voxel will change its

00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:14,329
polarization across two dimensions one

00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:16,899
is phase and the phase is changed based

00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:19,629
on how deep or

00:26:16,899 --> 00:26:21,789
how strong the voxel modification is and

00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:24,490
the second is angle and the polarization

00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:28,419
angle will be changed based on the

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:30,340
physical orientation of the voxel in the

00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,840
glass material and so those are the two

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,149
dimensions that I mentioned during the

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,279
write process that you can modulate and

00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:39,210
so effectively in order to read the data

00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:41,499
back what you do is you focus on the

00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,539
layer that you're interested in you

00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:45,970
shine light with a known polarization

00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:48,399
into the medium and then you effectively

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:50,889
measure what is the change in that

00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:54,820
polarization that each voxel imparted on

00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:57,639
the light and to do that we use machine

00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,700
learning techniques state-of-the-art

00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:02,259
computer vision techniques and in the

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,139
picture that you see there that's an

00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:08,830
actual picture of data written read from

00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:11,470
one of our samples and we use machine

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,659
learning to extract the symbol values

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,659
that were encoded of course we also use

00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:19,269
error correcting codes to fix any

00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:21,850
residual errors from the raw reading

00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:24,730
process and using these techniques I'm

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:26,110
very happy to say that in the past in

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,269
less than three years since the project

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,570
has been going we are now the densest

00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:33,369
optical storage technology in the world

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:35,139
so with that I'm gonna wrap up you know

00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:37,090
have a look at our website if you want

00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:39,580
more details on the project if you want

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,110
to read a paper about it and you know if

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,429
you want to work on the coolest storage

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,499
project out there right now

00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:46,570
join us we have a number of career

00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:49,179
opportunities we have a number of SDI

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:52,149
roles postdoc researchers internships so

00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:59,379
come talk to me or send me an email so

00:27:52,149 --> 00:28:01,269
yeah thank you thank you Yohan next up

00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:08,289
we have Henry Lowood of the Stanford

00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:09,730
libraries so as the Harold hoebuck

00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:11,440
curator for history of Science and

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,659
Technology collections at Stanford

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,049
University I'm responsible for

00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:18,820
collections projects and programs

00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:20,860
notably the Silicon Valley archives and

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,789
a bunch of initiatives on software

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:26,289
history or preservation the Silicon

00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:28,359
Valley archives is the world's greatest

00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:30,030
repository of materials related to the

00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:32,770
history and development of silicon

00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:36,070
these collections include documentation

00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:39,490
in every format including historical

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:42,070
software this is all good but in the

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:46,420
immortal words of James Stockdale Who am

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:48,190
I and why am I here for starters I've

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,770
been engaged in software history and

00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:53,110
preservation for a long time here's the

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,420
invitation I received almost exactly 30

00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,940
years ago to attend the first conference

00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:02,590
on software preservation held in early

00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:04,630
1990 in 1997 stanford acquired the

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,670
massive steven cabron eddie collection

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,320
in the history of micro computing here

00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,960
being used by students in the Department

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,760
of Special Collections at Stanford this

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,710
was probably the first institutional

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,340
acquisition of historical software

00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:23,230
collections my definition for massive by

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:25,210
the way is 1375 linear feet of software

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,340
hardware publications and documents

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,310
that's more than four football fields of

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:33,250
archival boxes and to end and it's just

00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:36,910
one collection this is what you'd find

00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:39,040
in some of the boxes I think you get the

00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,680
point my curatorial work takes me to

00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,710
artifacts like floppy diskettes and two

00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:49,660
data cassettes and other formats back to

00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:51,430
the 1970s nearly 20 years ago in 2000 I

00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,430
co-founded a project called how they got

00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:56,500
game this is a hub for projects in game

00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:59,230
and computing history as well as

00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,600
software preservation so back to the

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,550
question why me well I work on software

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,010
heritage both as a curator trying to

00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:11,800
save it and as a historian writing about

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:13,570
it next question why github a few years

00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,970
ago I worked with a team at UC Santa

00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,560
Cruz to develop a unified approach to

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,630
preserving what we call cultural

00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,540
software objects and their development

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,520
histories we coined the term cultural

00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,440
software objects to express the

00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,410
importance of software for critical and

00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,330
historical studies we simply cannot

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,210
understand the late 20th and early 21st

00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,110
centuries without accounting for the

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:40,300
design production and impact of software

00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:42,400
as we said in our white paper future

00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,680
scholars and designers will need

00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,050
well-organized

00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,830
viable archives to understand the

00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:51,060
history of cultural software objects

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,830
open-source software is a critical

00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,650
component of our software driven world

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:58,440
and github hosts millions of code

00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,570
repositories it is de facto a

00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:06,120
significant archive for cultural

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:08,700
software objects what is documented by

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,710
software in github besides the obvious

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,860
answer of software development history

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,750
let's consider some other examples the

00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,430
virtual Apollo guidance computer project

00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,800
supports computer simulations of the

00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:22,980
onboard guidance computers used in the

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,630
Apollo programs lunar missions clearly

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,660
important for the history of technology

00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:29,880
generally the code repository for this

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,350
project is on github but a full

00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,610
accounting of the project includes other

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:38,280
documentation such as issues posts or of

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,530
course the project website researchers

00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,530
need access to context and documentation

00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:47,540
found outside github to fully understand

00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:49,770
the code deposited inside github

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,270
business history is another area in

00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,820
which github based software has played a

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:57,270
significant role Bitcoin and Airbnb

00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,100
provide two examples for business

00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,470
related projects we again depend on

00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,020
access to external resources to better

00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:06,150
understand these projects and we may run

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:12,510
across restrictions that limit access to

00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:14,820
code and documentation documentation is

00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:16,590
also deposited on github for example the

00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,050
US National Archives and Records

00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,690
Administration Nara put its digital

00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:24,660
preservation framework on github for

00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,610
public comment this framework presents

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,590
preservation action plans for a variety

00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:34,110
of digital record and media formats such

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:37,020
as email or audio files museums have

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:39,570
also jumped into github cooper-hewitt is

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,210
the Smithsonian's design museum they've

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,330
made approximately 75% of the documented

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:47,070
collection available online their github

00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,680
account is full of and this is quoting

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,980
them tasty bits and tools that we use

00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,879
including metadata concordances and the

00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,609
cooper-hewitt typeface

00:32:55,879 --> 00:33:01,339
and finally an area close to my own

00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:03,379
heart entertainment notably computer

00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,879
games freedoom is particularly

00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:07,459
interesting for my own research on

00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:09,739
player created content based on source

00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:11,719
code released by in software it lets

00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:14,419
players run the huge catalogue of mods

00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:19,519
replays and speedruns created over the

00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:21,799
25 his 25 year history of Doom now the

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,769
last question my last question why

00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:28,609
Stanford what can we contribute to the

00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:30,739
github archive well in a nutshell

00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:33,019
Stanford will produce curated

00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:36,649
collections documenting selected github

00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:40,219
projects in depth these collections will

00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:43,369
include code but only begin their code

00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:45,409
alone is not enough we will dive in

00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:47,809
beyond the code repository to harvest

00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:50,719
contextual documentation that historians

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,509
and others will use to make sense of

00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:55,249
these projects and their impacts we will

00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:56,899
include documentation harvested through

00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:59,749
github features such as issue tracking

00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:02,690
and wikis but also external websites

00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:05,029
media and blogs in order to make this

00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,669
documentation discoverable we will add

00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:08,960
metadata and provide access

00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:12,139
interpretation and preservation for

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,029
these collections the next few slides

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,490
introduce the IT environment that will

00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:19,819
support this project we start with two

00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:22,339
robust preservation systems SD are the

00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:24,710
Stanford digital repository and locks

00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:26,720
you already know lots of copies keep

00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,409
stuff safe both of these were developed

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,359
at Stanford we're investigating

00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:34,819
strategies for capturing digital objects

00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:37,700
for github project collections and may

00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:38,990
end up using a mix of methods a quick

00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,639
shout-out here to our friends at the

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,250
Internet Archive for the hair tricks web

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:48,139
crawler which is our go-to for capturing

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:49,819
website content if we go with locks to

00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:51,440
preserve github assets we will be

00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:53,500
relying on a community or network

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,539
approach based on peer-to-peer

00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,329
verification and polling to identify

00:34:56,539 --> 00:35:01,759
correct errors over time we need a

00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:07,069
minimum of three partners to perform

00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:09,200
these data integrity checks the SDR is

00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:11,420
the other preservation serve

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,280
at our disposal as you see here it

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,260
involves multiple layers and services

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,940
for management access and preservation

00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:22,160
of ingested objects SDR assets are

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,680
discoverable by a Stanford's online

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,839
catalog called search works which is

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,780
available on the open web and exposed to

00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:31,579
the usual search engines digital

00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,190
documents and software assets are

00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:35,990
accessible via search works by the way

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,640
Stanford was a project partner in

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,170
preserving virtual worlds a pioneering

00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,990
project sponsored by the Library of

00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,220
Congress about a decade ago this project

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,990
produced a few collections around

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,820
historical game software such as the

00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:49,430
Dame Co the doom collection that you see

00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,170
here the connection here with github

00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,359
based free doom which I mentioned

00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:55,280
earlier is one of several links between

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:59,930
Stanford preservation projects and

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,060
github repositories collection pages

00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:04,940
with permanent URLs lie behind

00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,280
searchworks access as this example of a

00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,980
perl page shows we operate a repository

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,320
for preserving code and data produced by

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,569
Stanford Research Projects which might

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,069
be a useful option for github project

00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:20,630
collections finally an end product for

00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:23,300
this collaboration could be online

00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:26,060
library exhibits that interpret github

00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:28,069
projects spotlight what you see here is

00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,170
Stanford's application for showcasing

00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:33,050
digital content and easy to produce

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:35,599
exhibits metadata added to the digital

00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:37,910
content we ingest from github and other

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,470
sources will activate search and browse

00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,079
features and spotlight to help

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:44,920
researchers students and visitors to

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,180
interpret the history of these projects

00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,069
well that's it if you have questions

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,260
about Stanford's Stanford's role in this

00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:53,569
important project please feel free to

00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:58,000
contact me via email or Twitter

00:36:53,569 --> 00:37:00,619
thank you very much thank you Henry

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:08,059
next up is Roberto - Cosmo of the

00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:10,490
software Heritage Foundation hey

00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:13,430
everybody I'm very happy to be here I'm

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:16,760
a longtime computing science researcher

00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:18,829
hacker developer open-source advocate

00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,109
and today here and here in my head of

00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:22,760
director of software heritage to tell

00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:24,950
you about what we are gonna do together

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,779
with github but let me start from a

00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,490
first point we were all talking about

00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:31,220
software so two is fundamental in our

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:33,079
awardees powers our industry fuels

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,750
innovation is a pillar of modern

00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,240
research is an essential mediator for

00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,160
access to digital information but as we

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,990
know well as developer software doesn't

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,420
come out of the blue it is written by

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,970
people and not only written by people

00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,490
that also written by people for other

00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,289
people to read it's a very special kind

00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:54,529
of knowledge actually which is human

00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:56,539
readable and machine executable when I

00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:59,180
was a student many years ago too many

00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:01,430
years ago I was using a book by Herod

00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,809
Abbas on the structure interpretation of

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,599
computer programs when you find this

00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:07,880
phrase programs should be written for

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,309
people to read only access sorry for

00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,990
machines to execute well of course you

00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:14,000
can say this is a professor telling

00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:16,880
their students if they turn in homework

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,250
they cannot be read then they will get a

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,569
bad grade but it's more deep than this I

00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,920
mean the person that can read the piece

00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:22,730
of software should be able to read the

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,980
piece of software

00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,710
maybe you next week when you need to fix

00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:30,200
it well when he was writing this many

00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:34,250
years ago there was not much source code

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:36,230
available to showcase today 30 years

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,970
after the beginning of this free

00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,920
software movement we have an incredible

00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:43,099
amount of software available here for

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,529
example you get an excerpt of the source

00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:48,440
code of the Apollo guidance computer you

00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:50,779
see even if you are not yet familiar

00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,180
with a assembler that I'm showing here

00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:54,740
you can read the comments and you see

00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,900
that these people were actually very

00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,640
very very careful in programming

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,009
actually this is a part of the module

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,440
that is asking the astronaut to tune

00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:05,180
around the lunar landing module and you

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,819
see the programming is very careful when

00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,069
you get the messages a proceed I mean

00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:10,880
they asked when a push on the button say

00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:13,100
okay I have to

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,140
I'm around well the programmer just

00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,880
checks if he is lying I mean you jump

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,070
back and check with the antennas writing

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,860
in the right position but then there are

00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:24,350
other joys we were heard about the doom

00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,700
but you remember John Karma's incredible

00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,350
developer he also world

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,680
quake 3 you remember one of the

00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:32,810
ancestors of Call of Duty immature to

00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,850
many people including my kids were spent

00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:36,890
too much time on and this is an

00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,480
incredible routine which was embedded in

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,060
the source code that allows you to

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,880
compute one over the square root of x in

00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,340
a particularly sophisticated way by

00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,380
avoiding all floating-point operation I

00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,330
will not read the comments because some

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,520
of the comments are forbidden to less

00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:54,710
than 18 years old but I mean you can

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:58,010
just check it out offline my slides are

00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:00,830
online by the way as a registered vote

00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:03,770
in a beautiful piece of article some

00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:06,080
years ago actually source code is an

00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,850
open window in the mind of the

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,530
developers and so it's an important

00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,390
asset and we need to keep it because

00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,090
even if you are not able to run the

00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:16,310
binaries we can still read it and learn

00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:19,100
things by reading it ok but

00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:21,590
unfortunately this source code is a

00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,110
precious asset otherwise we will not be

00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:25,460
here but he's also an n dungeon heritage

00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:28,010
if you look at the past

00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,020
there are many key people who developed

00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:32,150
the technology we are using today who

00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,950
are passing away and we are losing their

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:35,870
knowledge at the same time if you look

00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,510
at the future software development is

00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:41,060
skyrocketing actually looking inside our

00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:43,370
kind we can tell you that the amount of

00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,820
original content in developers around

00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:50,960
the world doubles every two years and

00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:53,420
yet we are missing key elements today we

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,680
are missing a global catalog I fully

00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,600
agree there is a lot of interesting

00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,890
software on github but the results a lot

00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,200
of interesting thought which is not

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,300
around eat up and start to move Sarah on

00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,200
the changed names in project diable

00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:09,530
start and finish and disappear and then

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,230
we miss archives I mean you remember who

00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:15,770
remember Google Code anybody remembers

00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:17,720
it I mean was shut down 2015 1,500,000

00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:19,670
project endangered and many other things

00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,850
IDs are happening we do not have an

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,200
archive for software and finally what we

00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,540
are missing is a research

00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,990
infrastructure one of my best friends is

00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:32,170
directing the James Webb Space Telescope

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:34,670
program here in 30 years 10 billion

00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,079
dollars spent to actually look at the

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,380
urging of the universe something that I

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,510
definitely love how comes as computer

00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,660
scientists technologies we are not have

00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:47,000
not been able to put together a common

00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,680
open infrastructure for analyzing all

00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,349
the source code which is developed today

00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,630
so it was urgent to take action and this

00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:55,070
is a reason why a few years ago we

00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,560
started a project the code name is

00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:00,380
software Heritage's office our heritage

00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,320
the mission is very at the same time

00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,170
humble and ambitious we are going to

00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:08,270
actually look out there to collect

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:11,720
preserve and made available all the

00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:15,470
source code of all software written ever

00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,450
written only the source code all the

00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,790
source code of the software is written

00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,280
it is not just looking at the past it is

00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,810
of course collecting the history and the

00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,880
heritage of the software that has

00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,040
changed that a world that it is also

00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,960
building an incredible telescope to

00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,359
observe the galaxy of the evolution of

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,540
software across the world how would you

00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:38,210
do something like this in a long term

00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,800
perspective well you did require some

00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,599
thought you know I'm old enough I made a

00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,700
lot of mistakes in my life so I even try

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,160
not to make the same at least me to vary

00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,829
it a little bit the pressure so first we

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,450
think first we need more people sharing

00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:52,130
the vision you need an international

00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,839
universe and initiative that's the

00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,569
reason we have a partnership with UNESCO

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,089
and many other people in organization

00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:00,859
supporting our work this is important to

00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:02,990
raise awareness of the importance this

00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:05,540
mission here on the other side this of

00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:08,089
course costs money and I do not want to

00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,490
depend on a single donor or a single

00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:12,800
organization or a single structure

00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,200
that's the reason we had a bunch of

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,970
different supporters starting from a

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,640
national research infrastructure in

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,859
France which is called in Rio many of

00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,970
you know it and then many many different

00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:24,980
compensation you know there is a lot of

00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,569
white space there so if anybody wants to

00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,650
join in I mean they're worried I want to

00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:33,530
come and how do you do this technically

00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,990
and why this is more difficult than any

00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,060
other archival product process project

00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,920
we actually know well think about

00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,770
we want to archive all the through

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,080
school or ever written over the planet

00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:47,180
well now you need to go and talk to get

00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,790
that we are here talk to them happy to

00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:53,510
hear but you also need to talk to github

00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:55,640
to beat packet to NPM to pi PI to many

00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,380
men to Debian today that many other

00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,540
places with South Dakota is actually a

00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,060
variable and unfortunately there is no

00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,950
standard there is no HTTP before the

00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:07,190
other feed on this platform so we need

00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:09,830
to build adapters for every single one

00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,570
of these and to be able to talk their

00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,920
language and enlist the number of

00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,170
projects which are on each of these

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,540
platform but that's not enough then you

00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,590
discover that a lot of people uses git

00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,300
today but you have it

00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,910
thousands of project which are under

00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,640
different a show control system

00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:27,710
Sudarshan mercurial bazaar CVS you name

00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,320
it and then you have different formats

00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:33,620
for packages etc for a long term

00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,750
perspective we cannot just store a git

00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:38,570
repo or just or a subversion or a

00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:41,390
project or a zip file so we decided to

00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:44,600
go one step forward and we actually

00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:46,160
decide to him to translate the history

00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,870
development of all this kind of

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,020
differential control system all of these

00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:54,370
packages all this format into one single

00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,670
unified form ax which is basically eight

00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:58,460
gigantic

00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:00,860
Merkle tree at the scale of the planet

00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:03,080
think as a git repository at the scale

00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,990
of the planet where everything is they

00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:09,860
duplicated so this is actually building

00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:13,730
one of the biggest public graph of

00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:16,850
social expected production that are

00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:17,870
available on the planet today it is 20

00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:21,320
billion nodes

00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:24,470
280 billion edges I can tell you for

00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:27,650
every single file you produce in how

00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:29,080
many places it can be found okay this is

00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:32,150
an incredible source of other

00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,080
information in only takes up four

00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,730
hundred terabytes

00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,340
because of course we are duplicating

00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:41,840
everything the factor of compression is

00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:45,350
300 and then some milestone and I will

00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:47,270
just come to the work of today I mean

00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:49,100
all these started in the summer 2015

00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:52,190
here we shall see a picture of the first

00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:55,480
server in our data center we went public

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:59,270
from June 2016 will first sponsors in

00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,790
2017 we've signed an agreement with

00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:03,800
UNESCO here we see that former president

00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,720
of friendship public and many other and

00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,940
the former director-general of UNESCO on

00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,010
preservation of software we opened their

00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,960
kyv last year to the world so you can go

00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:14,270
there please go there archive dot so

00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,920
treasure at all you will not be lost the

00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,960
interface is kind of similar to the one

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,460
on Geetha but you cannot make pull

00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,800
requests okay it's in archive not a

00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,260
development platform and finally in

00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,300
December last year we opened up a mirror

00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,579
program to have copies of their kind

00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,140
under different administrative

00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:34,849
responsibilities all around the planet

00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:37,849
in in February there was a paris call by

00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:40,190
40 expert clinic convene at UNESCO

00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:42,500
headquarters stating that software

00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,930
source code is important as a part of

00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,790
our cultural heritage now if you look at

00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:49,819
what is in this parish goal there was

00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:51,380
for example a call to support efforts to

00:46:49,819 --> 00:46:53,030
gather and preserve the articles

00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,970
negative of the history of computing and

00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:58,280
a universal archive of preserving source

00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,920
code over time and when delighted to say

00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,660
that thanks to the division that we have

00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,430
seen and get up today we will work

00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,339
working together with up on two things

00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:09,260
one improving the software heritage

00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:11,810
acquisition process which is the process

00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,730
we published a few weeks ago telling you

00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:17,060
how to recover legacy landmark you

00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:20,660
source code and we will massively

00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:23,329
improve the quality of our archival of

00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:25,300
katha making it easier and sure that

00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:27,530
your repository will be archived

00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,540
regularly and quickly and will be

00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,920
available for the wrong time so sorry

00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,079
for taking so much time that you see

00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,359
it's kind of a passion of me to be here

00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:38,079
with you and sharing this if you want to

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:46,940
know more about the project just go to

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:50,480
www.aqualoja.net in to our slides today

00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:52,730
and looking forward to hearing more if

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,900
you are interested I'll be here tomorrow

00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:58,900
also thanks a lot take your Roberta

00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,240
and the last speaker for today's this

00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,260
session surely needs no introduction but

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,970
please put your hands together for

00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,970
Brewster Kahle of the Internet Archive

00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:13,000
so I'm wrapping up today and what I

00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:15,849
thought I'd try to do is give you a

00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,390
little bit of an idea of what the geeks

00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:21,730
view is and how wrong we've been about

00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:24,609
the issues around long term heritage of

00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:27,339
this stuff Internet Archive what we're

00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:30,549
striving to be is the Library of

00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:32,770
Alexandria for the digital age but the

00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:36,849
Library of Alexandria is probably best

00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:39,640
known for what burning right for not

00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:41,619
being here anymore or it was the center

00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,339
of learning for five hundred years and

00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:46,990
it's just so completely gone as best we

00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:50,710
can tell there's eight pieces of papyrus

00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:52,779
that are around today that we're in the

00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,809
ancient library right it's just so

00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:58,029
frickin gone so um it's a little

00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:59,650
daunting way of trying to view this but

00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:01,779
you sort of say okay yeah we're geeks we

00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:02,430
can we can try to figure out how to get

00:49:01,779 --> 00:49:05,950
around this

00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:07,900
so I'm Brewster Kahle the founder and

00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:10,270
digital librarian of the Internet

00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,710
Archive and I thought I'd show some of

00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,849
the different attempts that are in the

00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,619
either my personal collection or the

00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,750
internet archives collections of this

00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:20,559
sort of long-term heritage thing and

00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:22,930
sort of how is it going this is this is

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,710
cool this is the Hayek Amani Durrani

00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:32,730
score scroll so japan the empress

00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:35,440
Shotoku in the Year 764 87 64 AD was

00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:37,420
became Buddhist was really into it

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,660
really wanted the sutras to last a long

00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:44,500
time so she set out the challenge to

00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:47,049
make 1 million copies of the sutras and

00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:50,289
it's a scroll on the bottom and that

00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:50,770
that pagoda that leaf pagoda she's about

00:49:50,289 --> 00:49:54,359
this tall

00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:56,770
is a cover it's it's a it's a book cover

00:49:54,359 --> 00:50:01,079
they made a million of these things um

00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:04,779
and they put them in on ten different

00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:06,579
temples around Japan nine of those are

00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:09,140
completely gone but one is still there

00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:13,490
and they have a ton of

00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:15,829
and they came on hard times at the end

00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:18,769
of the 1800s and so they sold off about

00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:20,900
3,000 of them and that's one of them

00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:22,519
which I'm kind of happy we have one

00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,650
that's actually not that one but we have

00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,869
another one but that was sort of an idea

00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:29,569
of lots of copies keep stuff safe so

00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:32,180
that's one one way to go this is a

00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:34,190
picture of that cool rosetta disk from

00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:37,160
the long now completely awesome and sort

00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:39,710
of about the right about the size of it

00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,559
you can sort of see how big it is and

00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:44,510
it's it's a good puzzle if you're trying

00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,279
to figure out and this was something we

00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:51,140
did a long time ago so try to say what

00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:53,240
spin-spin-spin a commute on it or or

00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,160
shower on it and or just sort of a

00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,390
friends conversation around if you were

00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,519
trying to make something last a long

00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:01,460
time you have three questions what to

00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:04,010
put on it what to put it on and where to

00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:07,430
put them and this is a really cool

00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:09,470
answer to it and they say that it was my

00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,390
idea which i think is true and to do

00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:15,940
this the Rosetta project but it really

00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:19,339
was pulled off by the long now folks

00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:24,740
okay test for you guys do you know what

00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:26,779
this is it's a picture of microfilm

00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,569
right okay so it's a little you know

00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:31,460
this was during the 20th century the

00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:34,579
idea of taking pictures of pages and

00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:37,279
having these sort of funky readers to

00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:39,109
tour to see these old things was kind of

00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:42,529
an idea of universal access to all

00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:44,930
knowledge and the medium was the last

00:51:42,529 --> 00:51:52,240
500 years and actually it can't

00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:55,880
and unless it's thrown out so this is a

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,099
a canister of print masters of the

00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,809
periodicals in the United States so it's

00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:02,210
each one of those is a year year year

00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:04,339
year year year year year year of print

00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,710
masters so these are the actual things

00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:09,500
that that was then copied to send to

00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:14,809
libraries so that's 20 years of some

00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:16,519
periodical this is a the vault and if

00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:19,700
you look really carefully in the center

00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:21,710
there's me I'm in in the in the center

00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,220
of that thing and that's just one row of

00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,830
one

00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:27,619
or of the vault which went from

00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:29,420
university micro films to bought by

00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:32,300
Xerox and then it was bought by penny

00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:34,460
bulls and then became ProQuest and they

00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,320
spun it off to an a publishing which

00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,240
went bankrupt and it went into a bank

00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,180
and was going to be thrown away so we

00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,099
bought it so the the moral of the story

00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,480
here is yes this medium could have

00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:48,650
lasted for 500 years

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:52,450
if you don't throw it out and so the so

00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:55,190
it's kind of a lesson towards how to do

00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:57,080
continuity this is a picture of the

00:52:55,190 --> 00:53:00,080
physical archive of the Internet Archive

00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:04,430
in Richmond California and it's

00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:07,280
basically in indoors it's it's books or

00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:11,540
records or whatever in boxes on pallets

00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,369
surrounded by protected by boxes it's

00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:16,430
protected by shipping containers

00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:19,340
protecting by a warehouse protected by

00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:21,230
nonprofits so it's basically sort of

00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,900
there's levels of shields to try to

00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:26,570
basically have this stuff lasts based on

00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:30,530
different forms of attack or decay or

00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:33,619
institutional problems or or the like so

00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:40,400
this is sort of a an approach towards

00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:43,180
having things last it then lets go for

00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,010
digital eras that's a younger me that's

00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:48,349
standing next to a tape robot okay let's

00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:50,420
talk about terrible technology let's all

00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:52,430
talk about tape robots okay so they suck

00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,010
but they were able to get us to 20

00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,560
terabytes of collecting the World Wide

00:53:55,010 --> 00:54:01,400
Web to become the wayback machine

00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:03,200
starting in 1996 and the ones behind us

00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,780
we were dreaming of having a terabyte of

00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,359
spinning hard drive on the Sun

00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:11,630
microcomputer era things and and other

00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:14,420
types of of computers to be able to

00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:17,570
start to do books music video webpages

00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:21,200
software and we've been working away at

00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:24,470
it this is a copy of the when the

00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:27,890
Library of Alexandria in Egypt they made

00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:31,040
a new one of these libraries it came

00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:32,510
they were inaugurating new year 2002 we

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,900
said let's give them a copy of

00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:38,299
everything and so we did and it took up

00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,770
of an airplane and it's these computers

00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:41,420
behind it and they reaaargh connected

00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:43,730
the first floor and they were

00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,829
celebrating this digital collection

00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:49,640
which is really tremendous so this is a

00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:54,380
picture of that era of there's about 200

00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:56,329
terabytes in at that time of the Wayback

00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:59,480
Machine and the movies which were the

00:54:56,329 --> 00:55:01,549
things that we had at the time this is a

00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,849
picture of a shipping container we I

00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:06,200
hate building data centers they look so

00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:07,670
we thought why don't we go and make a

00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,079
data center in a shipping container and

00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,960
then you can just put it places you can

00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:14,359
put it outside Sun ran with the idea

00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,819
they credited us with coming up with the

00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:18,920
idea which i think is true and so they

00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:22,069
gave us one and we put it on the Sun

00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:25,940
campus and this is a picture in from

00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:27,740
2009 2009 of the wayback machine so I

00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:31,309
can answer how big is the web but you

00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:35,029
have to ask me how big is the web the

00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:39,829
web is 20 feet by 8 feet by 8 feet and

00:55:35,029 --> 00:55:42,680
it weighs 26,000 pounds and that makes

00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:45,529
it up 80 micrograms a hit which I think

00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,569
it's kind of fun um so that was the era

00:55:45,529 --> 00:55:50,690
then and actually I think it's about

00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:52,970
that same size now given hard drives are

00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,680
getting larger but we're off of Moore's

00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:57,710
law so it's a little bit of a problem

00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:01,430
this is the picture of the current peda

00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:04,460
boxes so this is what we currently put

00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:06,640
the Internet Archive this is a cut this

00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:10,010
is about seven and a half petabytes of

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:12,740
the primary copy of the Internet Archive

00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:16,309
it's in a church we bought in Richmond

00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:18,200
California please visit and the idea is

00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:20,180
to try to have these this is the primary

00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,609
part of the primary copy of about 50

00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:27,349
petabytes of the Internet Archive it

00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:30,770
costs about $1,500 per terabyte to try

00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:32,809
to keep a terabyte alive forever right

00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:34,880
so it and that's sort of assuming still

00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:37,720
an exponential and we really need some

00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:40,460
help out there guys to keep going on the

00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,710
decreasing curve so that basically it's

00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:46,700
a finite amount of money to keep data

00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:49,099
alive and going but this is sort of our

00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,260
current approach and we have not just

00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:51,120
the

00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:54,330
primary copy you have other copies and

00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,610
then Alexander Egypt Amsterdam Canada to

00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:59,040
be able to have other copies or a

00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:01,500
partial copies of this data in in

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,810
different places but all of this I've

00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:08,430
what I've learned is really the way to

00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:13,350
make things live is these things people

00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:15,120
and people that care that really at the

00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:17,610
end of the day I don't think it's going

00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:20,760
to be a hardware hack I think it's going

00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:23,490
to be people that care about the stuff

00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:27,900
and this is a picture of the Internet

00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:30,870
Archive staff and these are the folks

00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:33,840
that are are caring at the Internet

00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:38,180
Archive what is really amazing to me

00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:43,830
about this whole thing is github cared

00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:45,720
github cared that they said we think all

00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:47,670
of the work that's going on all the

00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,130
software that's being built on top of it

00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:53,070
is important to keep around forever and

00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:54,960
when John Evans came came to the

00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,970
Internet Archive and said would you be

00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,980
interested in working with github to go

00:57:56,970 --> 00:58:00,660
and make sure that this is permanently

00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:02,460
available in a different way than what

00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,910
they were doing with the others we were

00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:08,270
just overjoyed right usually we get to

00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:11,430
pick up the pieces after people go down

00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:14,280
or we're trying to do it I asked but

00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:18,180
rarely do they think ahead like github

00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:21,480
has and where's John Evans oh it's like

00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:25,200
can you come out and I think it's

00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:27,980
amazing and rare the github went and to

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,930
do extra level to go and put together

00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:35,120
different solutions for how to make this

00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:35,120
whole thing happen hooray for github

00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:43,730
so what we're trying to do is archive

00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:46,369
the whole damn thing and we think it's

00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:49,009
about 250 terabytes we want it to not

00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:50,569
just be a sort of a you know you're

00:58:49,009 --> 00:58:52,339
gonna have these sort of in the vaults

00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:54,259
sort of approach we're gonna try to make

00:58:52,339 --> 00:58:56,329
it live we're gonna try to make it so

00:58:54,259 --> 00:58:58,789
that it's still there you can check in

00:58:56,329 --> 00:59:01,130
and out you can talk the github

00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:03,170
protocols but also be able to be used by

00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:05,119
researchers in new and different ways if

00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:07,759
you want to participate in how this

00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:11,240
whole program works please work with the

00:59:07,759 --> 00:59:14,059
Internet Archive volunteer help work for

00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,509
us donate money any which way thank you

00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:16,509
very much

00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:22,400
thanks Christy I think all thank you to

00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:25,640
all of you for attending this session we

00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,980
really appreciate it we're done I think

00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:56,460
we're done yeah
