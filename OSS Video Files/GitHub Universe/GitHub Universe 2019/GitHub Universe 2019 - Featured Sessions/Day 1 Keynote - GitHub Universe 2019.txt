Description: 
	It’s our favorite time of year: GitHub Universe gives us all two days to celebrate 40+ million developers and their contributions to the open source community. In the past year alone, over 10 million developers have joined from nearly three million organizations in over 70 countries. We also made several exciting announcements. GitHub Actions and Packages are now out of beta, we launched GitHub for mobile, redesigned the notifications experience, created a program to preserve the world’s code for the next 1,000 years, and introduced lots of other features we think you’ll love.

For more information on all of the announcements from Day 1, check out the GitHub Blog: https://github.blog/2019-11-13-universe-day-one/
