Title: Day 2 Keynote - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-12-13
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Featured Sessions
Description: 
	Today at GitHub Universe, we announced GitHub Security Lab to bring together security researchers, maintainers, and companies across the industry who share our belief that the security of open source is important for everyone.

As part of today’s announcement, GitHub Security Lab is making CodeQL freely available for anyone to find vulnerabilities in open source code. CodeQL is a tool many security research teams around the world use to perform semantic analysis of code, and we’ve used it ourselves to find over 100 reported CVEs in some of the most popular open source projects.

We’re also launching the GitHub Advisory Database, a public database of advisories created on GitHub, plus additional data curated and mapped to packages tracked by the GitHub dependency graph.
