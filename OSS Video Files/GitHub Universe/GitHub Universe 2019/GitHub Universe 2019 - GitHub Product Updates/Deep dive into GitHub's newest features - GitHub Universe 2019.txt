00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,300
lo how are y'all doing today I love

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,190
excitement in here alright folks my name

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,140
is Jared McCree and I'm a senior product

00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,360
manager here at github and today we're

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,160
gonna do a deep dive into some of the

00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,170
newest features we've released I was

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,559
able to do this talk last year so I'm

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,110
incredibly fortunate excited and happy

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,840
to do it again so in my professional

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,970
career I've been a developer I've been a

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,910
product manager been a start-up founder

00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,670
and a consultant I got to tell you I

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,220
love being a product manager

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,480
I love diving into the UX with a design

00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,850
team and then going through the

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,830
day-to-day with my engineering team but

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,420
all this starts out with my favorite

00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,030
part of the job which is talking with

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,739
customers like you fortunately here at

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,230
github I've been able to work with a

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,010
wide array of different customers some

00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,830
of them are students executives QA

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,870
security DevOps the works and part of my

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,820
job is taking the feedback from all

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,100
those conversations and distilling it

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,710
into a coherent story that I can tell

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,410
our design and engineering teams to me

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,270
product managers are storytellers too

00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,500
and it's probably what attracted me to

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,270
being a product manager in the first

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,160
place because I've loved I've loved

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,240
stories since I was a kid

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,520
video games movies fiction nonfiction

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,290
loved them all I remember when I was in

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,330
elementary school and the Scholastic

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,430
Book Fair came around I always asked my

00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,290
parents for a bunch of money so I could

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,760
get a big stack of books and somehow

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,560
they always had enough money for that

00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,660
but I really think that laid the

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,750
groundwork for me being a storytelling

00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,730
PM so again we're gonna go into a bunch

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,070
of our newest features and when I

00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,480
thought about how to shape this talk I

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,120
thought about what's the most coherent

00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,950
story I can tell you what is how can I

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,510
present this material in a logical

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,190
manner so that you're able to have

00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,619
actionable steps when you walk away

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,060
because the goal of this speech and what

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,190
I want you to all to be able to walk

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,470
away with is having actionable steps

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,209
that'll help you and your project or

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,940
your business so I'm gonna tell you a

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,920
series of stories a series of stories on

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,609
the features that we've made how we

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,159
built them and why we built them so the

00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:31,349
name of this talk is deepest dive into

00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,900
our newest features and we've released a

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,340
hundreds of things in the past year so I

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,409
can't go through them all so when I was

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,969
thinking about which ones to choose I

00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,370
thought about who's gonna be here in the

00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:43,590
audience you know we've got press we've

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,590
got developers we've got executives and

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,379
because it's github I know someone's dog

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,879
is stuffed around here somewhere but for

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,879
today I'm gonna talk about three

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,280
distinctive people three specific

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,730
personas the developer the project

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,750
manager in the enterprise owner now many

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,430
of the features that I'm gonna walk

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,700
through they apply to more than one

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,680
persona that's okay what I'm gonna talk

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,139
about is how this particular feature

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,900
applies to this particular persona and

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,939
I'm gonna start off with the developer

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,250
now you probably heard in the keynotes

00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,040
and the speakers before our goal is to

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,030
be the home for all developers not just

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,040
hobby devs

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,859
not just architects not just security

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,139
minded folks the home for all developers

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,720
and everyone in this room is a developer

00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,389
whether you code right now or not now I

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,459
get to talk with a lot of new developers

00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:38,639
and it's it's always sobering for me to

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,500
do that you know some are in school some

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,049
are trying to create a new product or

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,690
first startup and some are looking for a

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,870
career change now all of them have the

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,500
exact same question where do I even

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,750
start

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,389
now we have 40 million developers who

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,329
work who use github and it would be very

00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,729
easy for us to think that everyone knows

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,229
git or github and that's absolutely not

00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:02,909
the case

00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:05,790
github we have a responsibility to help

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,500
you regardless of your skill level we

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,359
want to help new developers take that

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,129
first step I mean the four things we

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,560
want to teach especially are you know

00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,840
how do you use git what's the correct

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,970
merging flow how do you use pull

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,510
requests and comments how do you set up

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,680
an IDE or what is an ID even so github

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,150
desktop is an open source cross-platform

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,479
application that brings github into your

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,070
local device environment and it's

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,650
available for the low low price of free

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,470
today and you can download it at desktop

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,930
die github calm now get up desktop isn't

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,029
a replacement for get up calm it just

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,659
meant as a tool to allow you to be more

00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:44,370
productive

00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,150
we understand that git can be

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,340
intimidating

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,500
especially for new developers and github

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,780
desktop is designed to make interactions

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,660
with get more approachable and easier

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,100
now the Godot desktop desktop team has

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,960
been doing a lot of research and do

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,260
their research they learn that most

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,920
people learn get from a buddy be it a

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,320
friend a co-worker a professor or even a

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,110
youtube video now based on that feedback

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,090
we created a git and github tutorial to

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,750
be your buddy and so let's take a look

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,540
at it right now

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,740
when you download get up desktop for the

00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,950
first time you're gonna see a little

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,720
button on top it says create a tutorial

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:25,020
repository at this phase we're focused

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,140
on two things one creating a repository

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,600
and two connecting an editor there's

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,150
many tools that you need to get set up

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,830
encoding but getting an IDE getting a

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,480
code editor set up is it's one of the

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,120
first things you need and if you needed

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,070
a any advice on one I highly recommend

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,140
Adam this little company called github

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,540
made it and maintains it so I highly

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,730
recommend that after that we're gonna

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,650
walk you through the github flow it's a

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,780
branch based workflow that supports

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,880
collaboration and the steps that you're

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,730
gonna go through after that are creating

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,100
a new branch making a change to a file

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,860
committing it and then pushing it up to

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,140
github now all of this is leading up to

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,930
the beautiful thing that we like to call

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,910
the pull request now I know we all

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,610
mostly probably know what a pull request

00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,070
is but just as a quick refresher

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,950
refresher a pull request provide a forum

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:20,250
to discuss proposed changes on a branch

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:22,680
before you merge them in now before pull

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,450
requests you know it's actually getting

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,400
new code into a branch was kind of a

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,990
pain in the butt if you worked on a team

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,840
you had to bring your changes and

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,150
locally you had to test them find out if

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,190
what changes you needed go to a meeting

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,470
in real life with your team discuss them

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,180
go back to your computer make those

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,700
changes and do that whole cycle again

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,550
before you actually were able to commit

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,940
that branch to master now meeting with

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,370
your team is in real life is wonderful

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,310
but you lose a lot of productivity and

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,940
the benefits of pull requests are you're

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,490
able to assign and make reviews add

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,729
integrations and we're

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,860
remotely it's a great tool for for a

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,620
remote team and to be a very distributed

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,509
team now all features evolve and pull

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,610
requests have been out for a long time

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:14,240
and the natural evolution of pull

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:16,699
requests were work in progress PRS now

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,780
work in progress pull requests there I

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:19,789
mean there's a couple different reasons

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,400
people did that you you would open them

00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:25,130
to show progress on on work but not

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,690
necessarily need feedback you may be

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,789
experimenting with something and you

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,009
don't intend to merge it or you open a

00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:34,039
PR with no code you know just to start a

00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:35,930
discussion now the problem with you know

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,340
work-in-progress PRS is you always have

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,610
to tag it you always have to add that

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,789
WIP in the top and a title if you have

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,650
code owners on a pull request as soon as

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:47,810
you open that PR they're getting paint

00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,400
and at that time you don't need them to

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,620
review so once you need them to actually

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,740
perform a grouper view you have to ping

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,599
them again and if you have CI running it

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,389
can be a very expensive and you don't

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,190
necessarily need it at that time so we

00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:04,220
wanted to save you time here at get up

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,650
so we created draft PRS now these are

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,940
available right now on comm as well as

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,099
github and a price server

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,630
there's many wins and many advantages to

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:12,770
this but there are three specific big

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,020
wins I want to talk about for

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,370
work-in-progress PRS one they

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,870
automatically tag it and you're

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,849
automatically showing your team that

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,219
this is in draft status and this is

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,199
something that you can you can use

00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,699
throughout every team if you use if

00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,849
you're in multiple teams or multiple

00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:31,880
orgs some may put WIP in the top someone

00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:33,829
may say do not merge but having draft PR

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,469
is a common practice did you be able to

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:38,360
use throughout all your organizations it

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,760
also prevents accidental merging you

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,099
cannot merge a draft PR it has to go

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,860
into ready for review status and it

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:49,250
obviously reduces unneeded notifications

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,070
so change is good the change is also

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,740
very hard and we wanted to reduce the

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,100
friction to adopt in this feature so we

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,660
put it directly in the same button as

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,270
regular PR just click on that drop down

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,770
on the right select draft PR and now

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,750
you've opened your draft pull request

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,490
and again this is a repeatable pattern

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,709
that you can use throughout all your

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,900
different orgs and your teams now this

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,460
doesn't break how you code it doesn't

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,320
break how you

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,720
commits all of that is exactly the same

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,399
as soon as you're ready to use a mark

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,589
that draft pull request is ready for

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,230
review you just click on ready for

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:25,089
review and that's when the the feedback

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,760
starts now

00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:29,350
I want to pull request as you all know

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,510
there's there's many types of feedback

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,980
you get sometimes people come in and say

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,140
this is great or you need a test

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,720
sometimes they're saying this is great

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,240
approved and sometimes it's not so

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,890
positive I think my favorite pull

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,510
request comment I've ever gotten that

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,779
was up to like three in a morning coding

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:50,470
one time and I woke up and the PR

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:55,330
comment was at Jared this is the hottest

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:58,930
of garbage smiley face emoji yeah but

00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,760
that's what happens now sometimes as a

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,529
reviewer when you come in you know

00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,930
exactly what needs to be changed like

00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:07,779
sometimes it's a typo sometimes it's

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:10,510
linting sometimes you actually know what

00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,399
code needs to be added in now adding

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,990
these changes can be cumbersome you you

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,600
have to copy that line put it in a

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,370
comment and then the author actually has

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,279
to come back go into their local

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,140
environment paste that code snippet and

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,880
then push it back up it would be great

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,220
if we could make that easier and that's

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,290
what we did with suggested changes so

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,480
what you're seeing behind me is in a

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:34,750
reviewer coming in and making a comment

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,310
on a PR at that time they actually found

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,170
out which line of code they want to

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,520
change so what they're doing here is

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,160
they're clicking on a button that says

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,320
insert a suggested change that copies

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,330
that line of code into the comment and

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,459
the reviewer at that point is able to

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,560
actually make the change to the code or

00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,459
suggest it rather on the flip side for

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,529
the author

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:56,470
I don't know wait till it gets caught up

00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:59,740
here with that that author is able to

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,600
see the diffident the reviewer made and

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,579
they're you they are able to either

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,500
accept that or deny it

00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,820
now if they accept it what's great is

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,860
that the reviewer is added as a

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,450
co-author so in your contribution graph

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,730
you actually get credit for making that

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,760
suggested change and this is available

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,290
today on enterprise cloud as well as

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,510
github Enterprise Server for all those

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,270
Enterprise folks out there this doesn't

00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:24,190
it doesn't break any existing workflows

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,050
it's just a great painkiller feature

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,589
this saves time for both

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,839
developer and the reviewer now again as

00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:33,580
I talked about earlier features evolved

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,339
and based on that feedback that you all

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,490
gave us you said that you love this but

00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:42,339
you want more now the feedback said that

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,230
there's a lot of noise when accepting a

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:47,140
lot of different changes for example if

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,880
you have 30 different suggested changes

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,670
in a pull request that's 30 different

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,040
commits and the universal feedback was

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,079
that you wanted to batch all of those

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,470
together so we we added the ability to

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,170
add suggestions to a batch this way if

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,940
you have multiple suggestions or maybe

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,440
three or four that actually need to be

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,230
added at the same time so you can have

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,110
clean history you can do that one of the

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,640
people one of the pieces of feedback we

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,040
got was that for certain functional

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,230
programming languages if you only commit

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,959
one suggested change but not to others

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,029
it actually breaks the application so

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,890
now you're able to add them all to a

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:27,010
batch and then commit them as one single

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:30,100
commit so at this point we talked about

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,380
get a desktop using PRS reviewing

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,620
getting them merged you're doing work

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:39,339
now for any developer you need to be

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:42,399
able to track that work and you do that

00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:43,360
using user owned project boards now why

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,100
the heck am i talking to you about

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,200
project boards there's plenty of apps

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,959
out there to do it project boards aren't

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,290
new well the feedback we got was that

00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,279
our project boards weren't enough for

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,050
example you need to manage your own work

00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,209
sometimes it originally project boards

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,770
were only tied to a repository so if

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,810
you're working on projects across

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,220
multiple repos it wasn't very easy to

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,160
use that especially if you're in

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,690
multiple teams and also the piece of

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,640
feedback we got was that you wanted to

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,680
manage in your own style if you're in a

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,149
repo not your own personal project

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,980
you're kind of tied to whatever style

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,440
they want you want to be able to manage

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,420
that work in your own way now the

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,370
solution that we made makes it so you

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,769
don't need to be tied to a repository

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,260
you can organize and plan in your own

00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:31,089
style you can do this all within github

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,709
we want to be the home for all

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,660
developers and if you have to go to an

00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,130
outside application to track your work

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,130
you're not at home anymore

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,259
so this is available on comm as well as

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,540
Enterprise Server it's super easy to set

00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:45,699
up go to your profile page which is get

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,490
up comm slash your handle click on the

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:50,199
projects tab on the very top from there

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,449
you're able to make your project boards

00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,519
private you can make them public you can

00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:57,190
add in automation with Kanban or Kanban

00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,110
depending on how you like to say it but

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,269
you can also link to any repository that

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,220
you have access to this makes it easier

00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:05,380
to add issues and pull requests which

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,240
are related to the repositories you you

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,220
work in and you're able to track this

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,810
work for both the open-source work you

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,459
do as well as the enterprise work now

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,670
project boards aren't meant to track

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:20,949
everything you get pinged on something

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,959
in a comment there's a new feature that

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:24,970
you found in a repo that you want to use

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,170
there's a person you want to follow like

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,430
you're not gonna put all that out and

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,920
then in a project port

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:34,690
that's not scalable so how do you track

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,880
that you have 90 million tabs open and

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,810
personally there's a huge problem for me

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,600
I have intricate setups in Gmail to

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:45,699
highlight stuff I've got too many chrome

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,459
windows and Firefox windows with a bunch

00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,350
of tabs and what this told us is that we

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:52,360
didn't have what you needed you need it

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,250
home you needed something better so we

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,310
needed to overhaul our notification

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,079
process now my my colleague Becca talked

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,449
about this in the keynote earlier but

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,430
we've released this and beta now the

00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:06,699
benefits of our new notification program

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,380
our new diffic notification feature or

00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:11,079
that it's a consolidated view for

00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,569
triaging and context gathering you can

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,850
also similar to email you can mark

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:18,459
things as read unread unsubscribe

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,290
archived and even save them you can also

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,089
filter by project we have a bunch of

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,439
filters that are available by default

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,290
but you can also create your own custom

00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:29,019
ones to track what you want to now let's

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,790
take a look at what this looks like so

00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:32,860
as you can see this is very similar to

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,509
email that you've seen before if you

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,490
look on the top left you can see with

00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:38,589
what's unread what's in your inbox you

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,899
can also save notifications to come back

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:43,569
to them later we have five default

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,910
filters added by straight out-of-the-box

00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,449
but you can add those custom ones as you

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,370
want

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:49,420
again this is made to help you eliminate

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,280
tabs

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,220
and hope you triage your notifications

00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,220
better now this is the first project

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,660
that I've mentioned that is in beta and

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,240
we have a good amount of features in

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,970
beta so how do you enable this this is

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,530
something you have to opt into so what

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,200
we did for this and it's a little bit

00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:11,320
different we created a feature to enable

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,480
this feature called feature preview now

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,610
feature preview we added and about two

00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,430
weeks ago and we did this to allow just

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,020
to have like a very consolidated list of

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,470
all the features that are in beta right

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,630
now

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,820
and what this is enables you to do is

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:27,400
actually give more consolidated feedback

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,140
on to humans like me and other product

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,900
managers on the features that we've

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,180
released in beta if you're happy we want

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,560
to hear it if you're unhappy we also

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,740
want to hear it because we want to make

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,750
things better here get up we staff staff

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,390
ship everything so we test all of it

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,450
internally but we also do early access

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:48,490
programs for maintainer x' and such but

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,900
we wanted to cast a wider net we wanted

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,870
to get more feedback from all of you

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,910
users so how do you set this up you go

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,040
to your homepage click on the top right

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,440
on your avatar and navigate down to

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,120
feature preview from there you'll see a

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,590
list of everything in beta including the

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,470
notifications that I just mentioned

00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,970
you're able to opt in turn it on turn it

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,550
off and you're also able to provide

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,589
feedback and that goes directly to our

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,930
our product team and our engineering

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,300
teams and this gives a centralized place

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,980
for all that feedback I was talking with

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,079
Katie who was the product manager for

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,300
this and she had a great line for that I

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,370
wanted to let you all know when we

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,290
released stuff it matters to our

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,360
community and we want to make sure you

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,040
have a voice this feature is here so you

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,960
know that when you're actually giving

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,140
feedback on a particular feature it goes

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,870
directly to the product manager so that

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,070
is for the individual developer now

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,900
we're going to talk about the project

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,490
manager and what we strive to be the

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,560
home for all developers we know that

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,150
more than just coders work here and for

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,940
project managers we need to make sure

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,530
that we're making tools to help them now

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,180
the duties of the project manager a

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,010
little bit different than the developer

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,920
and the project manager you're dealing

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:59,200
with resource planning budget monitoring

00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,450
risk management and organizing and

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,010
managing a team organizing and managing

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,420
a team on github you

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,680
do that through roles and permissions

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,990
now we only had three roles that you use

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,630
to manage to manage github who's we

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,760
read/write and admin and you all told us

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,470
that's not good enough we need more than

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,600
that we need more fine-grained

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,730
permissions and so it's satellite we

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,070
introduced two new roles the triage and

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,840
maintain rules which we've actually g8

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,870
now for both enterprise server as well

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,290
as on cloud now the triage role can be

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:34,090
thought of as read Plus users with this

00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,700
role are able to triage a repository

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,980
without having right access to it

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,130
they're able to open and close PRS and

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,620
issues request reviews from developers

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,480
as well as manage milestones on the

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,820
other hand the maintain role can be

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,890
thought of as right plus these

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,990
particular users are able to manage the

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,480
entire repository without having access

00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:58,600
to potentially destructive capabilities

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,190
like deleting a repository they can

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,960
manage the entire software development

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,390
lifecycle for that repo including

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,850
pushing the protected branches locking

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,860
conversations and managing interaction

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,380
limits and it fits directly in the

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,690
current workflow to get it set up you go

00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,370
to the Settings tab on your repository

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,260
and then click on collaborators and

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:20,460
teams on the left from there you're able

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,800
to apply these roles to both teams

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,690
members and actually as well outside

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,130
collaborators and very soon in the next

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,350
couple months we'll be releasing this

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,850
ability to add this as a base role so

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,330
that any new members who come into your

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,520
org automatically get that role now

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,190
another duty of the project manager is

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,200
project planning and github issues are a

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,230
super powerful feature to help with this

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,570
you use them to communicate requirements

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,910
deadlines and even ask for help on

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,100
particular subjects and here at github

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,170
we use get up we use github issues for

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,310
everything one of the problems with

00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,620
issues though is that there's no

00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:59,140
standard way to add issues and this

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,840
leads to a lot of unneeded cleanup for

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,020
project managers it would be great if

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,600
github automated that so we did we did

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,490
that using issue templates now issue

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,520
templates help guide users through the

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,770
correct path when creating users the

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,900
benefits of this are when creating

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:19,540
issues now the benefits of this

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,430
you get a higher quality content you've

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,110
reduced the triaging for the project

00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,850
manager and you also have better

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,470
onboarding for new users because they

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,540
know the style that they need to be

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,840
writing their issues in now how do you

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,690
use this very simple you navigate to the

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,720
settings tab on your repository scroll

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,490
down and click on issue templates now we

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,140
give two standard issue templates from

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,730
the beginning those are bug reports and

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,010
feature requests but you're able to

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,870
customize these as much as you want the

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:50,080
things you can customize are you can add

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,090
suggested titles for these for these

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,760
issues you can also customize the

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,040
markdown format in the body you can

00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,170
automate what labels get assigned to

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,660
these as well as who gets assigned to

00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,520
those particular issues this is another

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,280
way to further automate your software

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,010
development lifecycle process now issue

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,380
templates live in your repository and

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,510
the dot github slash issue template

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,460
folder now this is great because if you

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,110
have multiple replot and repositories

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,090
and you want to use those same templates

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,740
throughout you can just copy that folder

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,660
from one put it in the other and it's

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,140
gonna have the exact same issue

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:28,960
templates for all of them again all

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,570
features evolved and based on your

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,270
feedback there's two major ones that we

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,640
we needed to change a very common use

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,830
case for for maintainer x' is someone

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
will come in and write a question in an

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,330
issue there's nothing wrong with that

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,520
but it would be better suited to be

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,710
asked in a slack question there's gonna

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,470
be a slack channel so you all asked us

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,930
how would can we direct our users to our

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,910
slack workspace or channel another

00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,940
common thing that happens is someone

00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:00,250
will go into a repository and create an

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,730
issue and it'll be blank it'll just have

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,530
a title thanks to super cool but that

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,510
doesn't help anybody and that just leads

00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,880
to the project manager I'm gonna go back

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,890
and ask more and more questions so we

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,200
added more control with issue templates

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,640
and a llamó file so this yellow file

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,290
lives within the issue template

00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,420
directory and it gives you more control

00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,250
over your issue templates so you can see

00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,830
here on the top left I've turned off

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,290
blank issues so people are have to use

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,820
issue templates or one of the provided

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,820
templates you had and there can't be any

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,289
more blank issues you can also link to X

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,320
Journal resources what I have shown here

00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:37,630
is linking to the get up community forum

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,029
as well as the bug bounty program but

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,659
you can link to a slack slack workspace

00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,820
as well

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,130
and being that all of this is and get

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,950
its version so you can audit this as

00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,169
well as any whoever changes it another

00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,409
problem that we have and we ran into is

00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:54,880
duplicate issues much as you set up

00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:57,070
issue templates people are still gonna

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,259
put in duplicates there so we introduced

00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,299
this small sexy little feature called

00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:03,669
similar issues so what you're seeing

00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:06,399
here on the right is I'm going in to the

00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:09,850
rails org and I'm gonna add in a bug

00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:11,799
report Grails uses issue templates to

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,840
shout-out to them but what I'm doing

00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,450
right now is I'm trying to add in a bug

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,049
for an invalid argument as soon as I

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:24,220
start typing invalid argument what shows

00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:26,019
below is a about four different other

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,330
bugs that have already opened up been

00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:29,860
opened up for that invalid argument now

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,230
what the benefits of this are it helps

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,850
users find existing issues that already

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,590
have pertinent details if you're gonna

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,480
open a bug report and it's already been

00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,220
made you actually may be able to find a

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,409
workaround and help you and you don't

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,570
actually have to log that bug report so

00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:45,639
second thing again helps project

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:48,429
managers and maintainer Xand triaging

00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:50,200
duplicate issues so that's another

00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:54,220
problem that we help solve something

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,659
else is is incorrectly filed issues so a

00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,669
lot of project managers they have

00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:59,950
multiple different repositories and as

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,870
much as you try and get issues in that

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,210
right repo they're not always going to

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,950
do it and for the project manager what

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:08,110
you're having to do is delete one issue

00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,929
copy the content here put it in another

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,120
repo tell people to go to this issue not

00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:15,490
that one and it's just a lot of wasted

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,250
time so we wanted to reduce those manual

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:20,830
steps it takes to transfer an issue and

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,379
that's why we created transfer issue now

00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,870
transfer issues don't just navigate the

00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:28,090
content of the issue but in it migrates

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,980
all the associated metadata as well the

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,379
assignees the labels all of that also

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,509
goes over and there's no need to update

00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:36,850
users on the new location of the issue

00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:38,620
they're automatically redirected once

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,750
that issue is transferred this is

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,610
available on github.com as well as

00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,530
enterprise server now how do you use

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,270
this super easy

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,950
navigate to the issue that you want to

00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,540
transfer and click on that beautiful

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,640
button on the right that says transfer

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,650
issue from there you're able to choose a

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,480
repository that you'd like to transfer

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,360
it to you can transfer it to any

00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,090
repository that you own or any one that

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,040
you have right access to once you've

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,750
done that click on transfer issue and we

00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,880
take it from there in terms of migrating

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,070
all that content this is just something

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,430
another thing that just saves time for

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,720
the project manager now that's all I'm

00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:17,080
going to talk about with issues right

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,420
now another another duty of the project

00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,490
manager is setting up new projects and

00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,440
typically something that we find with a

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,230
lot of organizations is that they have a

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,360
quote/unquote blessed scaffolding for a

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,490
particular for room for how they want

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,350
repositories they know how they want the

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,850
file and directory structure to be set

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:37,180
up they have the issue templates they

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:39,820
want but a lot of time is spent getting

00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,800
that set initial scaffolding set up it

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,650
would be great if github could automate

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,290
it so we did and we did that with

00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,510
repository templates now repository

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,760
templates allow any user with right

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,490
access to a repo to mark it as a

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,080
template after that any user that has

00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,660
read access to that particular

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,700
repository can come in and use it as a

00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:03,580
template and it'll have this exact same

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,620
files and directories as its base this

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,690
is available on github.com as well as

00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:11,290
Enterprise Server and setting it up

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:14,260
super easy navigate to this settings tab

00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:18,160
on your repository and click on Markus

00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:20,710
template done now any user that wants to

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,970
go in and create a new repository with

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,830
that template can just go to that

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,440
repository and click use this as a

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:30,580
template or use the URL to get it set

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,530
back up so folks we've talked about now

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,750
the developer we've talked about the

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,640
project manager and now I'm going to

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,800
talk about the needs of the enterprise

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,210
owner so the needs of the enterprise

00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,250
owner a little bit different because

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,510
your responsibilities are different the

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,840
enterprise owner is thinking about

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,250
effective DevOps automation security and

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,740
compliance continuous integration

00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,510
they're also thinking about how do how

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,660
do I make sure that all the platforms

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:57,160
that my employees use are easy to use

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,210
you're trying to make sure that those

00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,740
platforms are cost

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,660
efficient because we all have a finance

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,850
department and we want to make sure that

00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,450
we're able to easily enforce policies

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:08,380
across all of your applications

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,960
ultimately you're trying to maximize

00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,750
innovation while reducing risks

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,940
now here github what we do focus on

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,100
enterprises getup was built on open

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,810
source and the needs of and while the

00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,820
needs of enterprises differ from the

00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:24,130
open source community there are concepts

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,770
that can be applied to enterprises to

00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,390
drive innovation now new applications

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,580
regardless of where they are are made up

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,430
about 80 to 90 percent open source

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,470
software so enterprises are reliant on

00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:38,410
open source whether they know it or not

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:41,410
a common issue for organizations is

00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:43,720
working in silos now silos prevent

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,030
collaboration both internally within

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,830
your teams but also externally within

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,140
the community and your community and an

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:53,170
enterprise being your enterprise team

00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,090
now the open source community teaches us

00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,940
to foster more collaboration and a

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:01,150
concept that we call inter sourcing now

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,890
inter sourcing applies the the lessons

00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,200
of open source to all software

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:08,800
engineering it does this to increase

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,990
quality speed and developer joy and the

00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,900
fundamentals of inter sourcing are open

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:16,480
communication transparency and internal

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,400
collaboration now internal collaboration

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,500
isn't simple you know it's often

00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,960
multiple teams working across multiple

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,780
projects can become disconnected and

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,300
this results in duplicative work a loss

00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,690
of cross team communication and a loss

00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:34,210
of knowledge sharing now at best this

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,650
creates a drag on productivity but in

00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,840
the worst case it creates security

00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:40,420
exploits there's a very common one that

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,160
happened where a bug was found in a team

00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,930
and they fixed it but didn't tell the

00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,190
other team that they worked with and

00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,560
this actually created a very large

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,500
exploit which we all have had to deal

00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,690
with now get up has been known to help

00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,580
distributed teams collaborate for a long

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,500
time and we're trying to do that to just

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,930
better drive innovation within the

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,390
open-source community as well as within

00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:04,330
enterprises now we're continuing to

00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:06,030
enable enterprises by building this very

00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,860
cool feature we called internal

00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,510
repositories now internal repositories

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,090
add the ability to see the same

00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,970
repository across any

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,130
organization you can search for discover

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,230
reuse code and contribute to those

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,450
high-value projects all within your

00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,070
enterprise for the enterprise owner this

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,169
gives you peace of mind because no

00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,600
outside contractors will be able to see

00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:30,360
these internal repositories none of your

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,340
IP will be released and it's very simple

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,279
to set up a new repository with a

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,830
setting click on new repository you'll

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,850
see a third setting called internal and

00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,029
you'll set it right there

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,640
this is all done through the enterprise

00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:46,710
account now the enterprise account gives

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,809
administrators a single point of view a

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,159
single point of visibility into the

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,740
management of their of their

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,090
organization and a big thing for the

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,789
enterprise owner and the enterprise

00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:59,220
admin is managing policies and you can

00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:02,100
manage policies at this level you can

00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,690
set the repo creation permissions do you

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,299
want people to be able to create public

00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:09,090
repositories private internal or

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,799
combination of both do you want forking

00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,289
on your organization do you want your

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,960
users to be able to fork from private

00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:17,850
and internal repositories you can also

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,590
control invitations if you don't want

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,539
outside collaborators in your org you

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,909
can set this at that and set this policy

00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:26,309
at this level as well as repo and issue

00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:30,210
deletion you can turn this on or off at

00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:32,760
this level now security is also managed

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,289
at this level you can enforce two-factor

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,960
authentication throughout your entire

00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:39,059
organization you can set up sam'l either

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,279
your own custom one or a proprietary one

00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:42,779
as well as view the audit log data we

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,340
have a very cool little GUI that

00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:48,120
actually shows you where your your

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,649
instances are being accessed from now we

00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,140
have this concept called enterprise

00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:53,820
fundamentals it means that we actually

00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,010
need to be that we need to deliver

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,080
certain functionality to our enterprises

00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,190
to allow them to innovate and through

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,929
that feedback and through the

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,000
conversations we've had with enterprises

00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:06,659
you said that we needed an IP filtering

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,179
so an alpha today we've allowed IP allow

00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:11,520
lists now IP allow list allows github

00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,440
enterprise cloud customers the ability

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,649
to filter traffic from specified IP

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,470
addresses you can filter the log in of

00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:22,200
course but also sam'l SSO it also

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,659
filters private personal access tokens

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,860
as well as that's a sage keys all done

00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:28,230
all done through the

00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,270
enterprise account it's very easy to

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,950
enable this go into your enterprise

00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,960
account and click on settings on the

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,570
left from there navigate down to

00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,610
security and you'll see IP allow us in

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:40,730
the very bottom from there you're able

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:44,070
to restrict or filter IP addresses

00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:46,410
individual IP addresses or an IP range

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,090
as well as adding in a description now

00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,530
this is available in alpha and we'll be

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,049
releasing it in beta in the next couple

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,700
weeks but if you'd like to actually get

00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:55,770
involved in that beta there's a

00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,480
gentleman right there in the hoodie you

00:31:55,770 --> 00:32:00,630
can talk to him and you can get on the

00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,010
beta list now we've talked a lot today

00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,750
we talked about a couple of different

00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,790
things so let's review we talked about

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,250
the developer the project manager and

00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,049
the enterprise owner for the developer

00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,059
we got you started with github desktop

00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:13,860
and then you open your first draft pull

00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:16,679
request once you made that pull request

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,750
your reviewer gave you some suggested

00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,460
changes and you track your work on your

00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,290
project board from there you are

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,140
actually triaging notifications that you

00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:27,510
enabled through feature feature preview

00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,370
for the project manager we gave you more

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,260
fine-grained permissions with triage in

00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,850
the main chain chain rule you set up

00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,380
issue templates the guide your users

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,299
better and how they want to start and

00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,790
how you want them to set up their issues

00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,500
you reduce duplicate issues with similar

00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,630
issues and then you transfer it issues

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,220
with issue transfer and it gets started

00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,830
up with projects better

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,510
you have repository templates for the

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,520
enterprise owner we talked about the

00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,620
concepts of inner sourcing and how

00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,610
internal repositories drive that now

00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,559
it's all controlled through the

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,870
enterprise account I told you about our

00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:01,650

enterprises more folks I told you a

00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:05,730
series of stories on the features we've

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,590

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,750
all and what I'd like you to think about

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,160

built the build now and build in the

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,210
future and in the spirit of open source

00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,630
whatever you end up building github will

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:24,150
