co-founder of red Munk a company that is

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,790
focused on software practitioner and the

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,860
developer research he has been over a

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,720
decade trying to help developers to

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,330
understand the broader trend in the

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:28,020
industry by analyzing who's using what

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:29,610
and why welcome Rachel and Steven it's

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:36,120
so great to be here Kat who you had to

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:37,880
have you Thank You Kathy sure I started

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,310
yeah

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,440
okay hub our mission is to be the global

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,380
platform for developer collaboration and

00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,650
today we're home to over 40 million

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,870
developers from open source project

00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,210
maintainer x' two contributors to

00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,460
researchers and scientists from

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,400
enterprise users to students and

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,010
teachers this vibrant growing community

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,400
in the last year alone has created over

00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:08,129
forty four million new repositories 87

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,819
million pool requests and closed over 20

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,400
million issues today github is also home

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,430
to over 1.7 million students and a

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,489
31,000 teachers they use the platform to

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,530
help learn software development and the

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,290
developer collaboration and also best

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,780
practices and these are real-world use

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,880
case where college and universities

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,330
helped to embolden the community

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,490
of our future developer Rachel from your

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,610
perspective how do you think this trend

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,740
of helping how do you think of the China

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,630
to using our platform for learning and

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,300
how do you think this will impact our

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,700
future generation of developer well

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,290
first of all Kathy I want to give a huge

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,640
call out to you and a thank you to you

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,950
for all the great work you did and

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,050
helping pull the data for this year's

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,570
October's report you know I've only been

00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,460
at github for just over a month but I

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,230
had so much fun working on this report

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,630
with you and the fantastic team behind

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,370
it and it was just really inspiring to

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,250
me to see all the great work being done

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,020
in communities around the world so that

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,450
was really exciting but I must say I

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,270
feel particularly enthusiastic and

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,420
inspired by these education numbers

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,580
which are really special because as you

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,040
noted in the intro I feel really

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,560
passionate about the idea of making

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,930
careers in technology more accessible to

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,090
more people and the work being done by

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,700
our education teams to help grow this

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,420
these communities is really really

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,580
phenomenal so you know I think back to

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,220
when I was a new software developer and

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,320
the first job I had in industry and it

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,470
was super overwhelming and super

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,870
intimidating because not only was I one

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,320
of the only women in the room but I was

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,690
also exposed to entirely new software

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,960
development stack and new developer

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,540
tools new workflows new processes I had

00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,770
just never seen before in an environment

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,770
where I was actually pretty

00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,630
uncomfortable asking questions so I look

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,420
at these numbers and I think wow I'm

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,610
really hopeful that this is a big group

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,290
of students who are able to ask

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,970
questions of one another who are

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,739
learning together with the real-world

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,380
tools that they're going to use to be

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,640
successful in industry right and you

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,170
know as doing some research for the

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,450
October's report I spent some time

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,740
talking to the education team I'd really

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,600
like to give a shout out to them they're

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,780
an awesome team doing really great work

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,910
and so not only are they doing work to

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,990
grow these communities of students

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,000
they're also doing work to support

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,430
teachers you know we understand that

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,220
teaching is an incredibly difficult job

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,800
so if we can provide industry standard

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,560
tools

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,060
teachers for free and help them sort of

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,009
make their lives a bit easier and how

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,659
help improve their teaching outcomes

00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,400
that's something that's really great too

00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:53,050
so as you can tell I care a lot about

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,520
this topic I could probably use a whole

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,490
session talking about it I would just

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,080
mention one last thing that the Vanessa

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,659
the lead of the education team told me

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,520
which was she was explaining to me how

00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:07,090
the campus experts program works and

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,639
this is a program where you know we're

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,250
really empowering experts around the

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,650
world on campuses to build inclusive

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,750
communities of developers for learning

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,460
and you know the thing I really like

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,639
about this this program is that we

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,840
really recognize that it's the people on

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,719
the ground who know best what their

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,770
communities need and so vanessa was

00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:31,719
telling me about you know in some cases

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,219
spending funds on a pizza party might be

00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:35,379
the best way to grow an inclusive

00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:38,560
community right now in other places and

00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:41,680
there's examples of people using github

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,169
funding to pay for generator hours and

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,120
so you know I think is really inspiring

00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,680
to think of the creativity of these

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,690
campus experts who are really helping

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,979
grow the next generation of software

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,620
developers and helping them do their

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:55,180
best work definitely as a former data

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,099
science student myself I want to give a

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,219
shout-out to the birthday data science

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:02,080
program we use the github extensively

00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,870
through our master program and we

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,370
benefit from that tremendously Steven we

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,699
would want to hear yourself on this as

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,930
well sure so you know for anyone in the

00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,639
audience who knows read monk and more

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,840
particularly for those that don't you

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,870
know read muck has argued for a long

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,389
time that developers are empowered in

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,669
ways they have never been before you

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,590
know in a they manifest this sort of

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,719
this this power that they've accumulated

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,940
in many ways throughout their individual

00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,529
careers and their enterprise one of the

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,569
reasons for this of course is the

00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,370
difference in education so Rachel talked

00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:35,469
about you know when you know she was

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,060
getting into the business as a you know

00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,529
cutting her teeth as a developer you

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,229
know I had that same experience you know

00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:44,469
when I got started much longer ago than

00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:46,270
I would care to admit this fight and you

00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:47,949
know I didn't have the resources that

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,409
are available to developers today right

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,149
there wasn't this wealth of open-source

00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,979
software available that I could go and

00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:55,479
pick up and learn from

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,860
you know the tools you know to allow

00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,749
that kind of collaboration weren't there

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,939
online courseware

00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:03,249
you know was not a thing so you know it

00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:06,759
was much more difficult you know back in

00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:08,110
my day you know you know to learn you

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,399
know certainly it is today the

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,189
institutions themselves have also

00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:14,110
evolved right you know many of you in

00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,059
the room who you know graduated from

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,949
from computer science programs you know

00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:19,059
sort of over the last decade had a very

00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,339
different experience you know perhaps

00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:22,869
you know then those of us who took

00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,779
computer science you know 20-30 years

00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:27,189
ago the institutions have evolved right

00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,649
the institutions the curricula

00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:31,119
associated with them are night and day

00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,149
different in terms of the way that they

00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:35,559
teach computer science today and in a

00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:38,259
sort of you know perhaps lastly and

00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:40,209
maybe most importantly we have seen this

00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:41,949
new class of educational institution

00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,360
emerge in these these boot camps right

00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,219
and this is near and dear to my heart

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,349
cos you know when I am you know when I

00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:48,669
graduate from college and I started with

00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:49,930
the systems integration firm

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,459
you know I effectively went through a

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,189
you know the equivalent of a boot camp

00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:56,709
it was an eight-week residential program

00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:58,479
and so it's great to see you know so

00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,279
many educational opportunities which can

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,080
take you know so many more people and

00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,029
get them into the industry get them

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,620
familiar with you know computer science

00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:07,569
and get them contributing to software

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,939
around the world very interesting thank

00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,399
you for sharing now I want to switch

00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:14,490
gears to working professionals our data

00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,379
indicate an increasingly interconnected

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:20,589
community and that of course including

00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,930
our developers at work in fact both the

00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:24,849
diversity and engagement metrics around

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,119
are among our enterprise users are

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:30,550
trending up in the last year alone 70%

00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:32,349
of the global fortune 50 companies have

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,229
made contribution towards open source

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,399
project on github so Rachel and Steven I

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,069
love for you guys to walk us through

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,459
this trend of open source at work how do

00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:44,709
you expect that to grow yeah so I mean

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:46,839
this trend is growing and you know

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,760
there's no signs of it slowing down and

00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,800
I think you know companies big and small

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,660
around the world recognize the value

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,189
that's out there in the open source

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,980
community there's just millions of

00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:59,199
people working and some of the brightest

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,819
minds in the world and you know when you

00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:02,590
just have that many people you know I

00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:04,690
firmly believe that more eyes

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,930
code and more heads thinking about a

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:11,680
problem leads to more robust and sort of

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,480
more creative solutions so for sure you

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,680
know this is something that enterprises

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,590
are getting on board with I actually

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,750
lived this firsthand because you know I

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,420
spent over the past decade of my life at

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,490
Google where we really moved from sort

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,750
of a more walled garden software

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,990
development approach to really

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,000
recognizing the value of open-source but

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,580
you know I really like to think about

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,950
human beings so so one one thing I would

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,980
attribute to this trend as well is also

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,380
the motivation of individuals so you

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,380
know I remember many many years ago as a

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,500
software developer manager the first

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,150
time I had someone on my team contribute

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,670
to open source and so it was long before

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,940
github existed but this is a person on

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,140
my team who wrote one line of code and

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,930
submitted a patch to the Linux kernel

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,270
and the amount of pride and excitement

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,560
that that individual got from doing that

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,480
this is a person who was writing

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,610
thousands of lines of code inside our

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,890
company but like not one line of code

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,410
meant so much to this person and you

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,370
know it's part of being bigger you know

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,070
part of something that's bigger than

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,480
then then you being part of you know a

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,760
movement that's changing the world

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,230
affecting people all around the world so

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,090
I think there's some real human

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,960
motivation to getting involved in in a

00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:28,300
resource we understand now too that you

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,220
know a lot of times technology decisions

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,290
and companies are being made at the

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,080
grassroots level so you know no longer

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,090
is it really the CEO or CTO who's making

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,380
the call and what technology to use but

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,960
it's really the developers and

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,550
development teams who you know see the

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,820
value and open-source see what's out

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,770
there

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,780
and then also I believe have this you

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,060
know human motivation to engage in this

00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:52,510
global community map this morning in his

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,430
keynote called open source at the

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,380
biggest team sport in the world and I

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,940
think it's really fun to be you know a

00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:03,280
part of that world yeah it's a great

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:05,620
sport Stephen what about you so yeah so

00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,230
I think the human motivation angle I

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,940
think is is exactly correct and I think

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,070
that can also work in in sort of the

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,540
opposite direction if you will so we

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,340
tend to think of companies in many cases

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,450
as he sort of phenomenon of us like

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,800
faceless you know sort of

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,230
these that are sort of divorced from

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,940
from human motion and the fact they sort

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,640
of exhibit you know very human traits in

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,740
many cases so you know when we talked

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,600
you know we still use this today but you

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,340
know certainly you know as company

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,840
started to sort of approach open source

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,880
one of the things we talked to them

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,520
about was the pattern that we have seen

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,130
play out in sort of in the past right so

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,020
if you go back to say circa 2000 right

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,150
what we all now take for granted in

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,370
software-as-a-service was introduced as

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,260
this idea and companies looked at this

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,150
and said absolutely not

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,190
I mean this is insane you know they had

00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,300
up to that point been accustomed to

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,760
buying their software owning their

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,200
software sort of in perpetuity and you

00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,550
know sort of this new model coming in

00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,090
and saying well you're gonna rent it and

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,560
so on it was just too much over time of

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,660
course is any but you know sort of user

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,460
of github.com you know knows right now

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,170
software's and services become

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,600
mainstream right as regular everyone

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,160
does it everyone uses it and we see sort

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,320
of much the same trend at work with open

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,670
source in the sense that in the early

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,860
days when companies looked at this they

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,750
said no no I can't do it because I don't

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,130
want to fund my competitors I think this

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,230
is some you know sort of writer

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,760
advantage you know they focused on all

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,950
these sort of perceived risks and

00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,230
downsides you know in a very again human

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,330
fashion when you know what we've seen

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,490
sort of and it's a gradual process it's

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,530
not a you know there's no unfortunately

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,540
sort of you know overnight epiphany that

00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,860
companies tend to come to but when they

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,680
look at this sort of over time what they

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,990
find out in most cases is that there are

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,180
many many more benefits that outweigh

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,190
easily this sort of perceived risks and

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,210
downsides so we end up seeing today is

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,460
is that you know from a trajectory

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,780
standpoint you know it's just you know

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,250
we see more and more contributions

00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,010
coming from you know these sort of

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,670
fortune 500 fortune 100 organizations

00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,250
simply because it makes business sense

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,110
right you know the upside is again just

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,240
much greater than the downside it's just

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,620
you have to you have to be patient as

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
they get through that process yeah

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,520
definitely when I come to software

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,070
development many of our users wear more

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,960
than one hat

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,390
okay hub our mission is to be the home

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,060
for all developers so that's why when we

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,130
segment our data geographically we see

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,650
millions of our users are creating

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,850
repositories commenting on issues making

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,190
poor requests in the making

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:31,699
contributions from just about anywhere

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,649
in fact as we noted today nearly 80% of

00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:36,680
our contributors come from outside of

00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:39,410
United States ratio I'm curious to see

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,389
yourself on this contribution diversity

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,740
that is happening on github can you

00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,459
share something yeah well first of all I

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,439
love it

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:47,740
I mean github is the home for all

00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:50,209
developers and that's not constrained by

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,279
geographical boundaries so I think this

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,800
is really excellent and you know if you

00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,870
if you dig in to the octopus report

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,529
you'll see we have some statistics

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,480
around contributors by continent and at

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:05,480
this point at North America is actually

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,189
third after Asia and Europe which is you

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,920
know really what you would expect from a

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:11,660
population and perspective so I think

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,389
it's really nice to see that increased

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,089
global representation and a very

00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:19,490
positive thing this here we're talking

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:22,009
about not just open source contributions

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,750
but we're talking about contributions to

00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:26,089
both public and private repos and so I

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,620
think there is one factor that made a

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,829
bit of a difference here over the last

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,290
year which is earlier this year get have

00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,360
released a free private repos that's

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,069
right allowing developers to host a

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,459
private repos for free as the name

00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,720
implies and so I think you know that's a

00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,019
really interesting trend because we've

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,319
seen adoption and engagement with that

00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:50,959
feature all around the world I think you

00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,939
know we shouldn't underestimate the

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,670
difference that in some places around

00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:57,019
the world a few dollars can make towards

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,009
actually being able to start a business

00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:02,660
right or not right so this is really

00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,089
removing a barrier to entry for some

00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,009
people where you know they want to start

00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:10,370
a business they want to maybe keep some

00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,720
IP private or they're not yet ready to

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,329
share what they're working on with the

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,240
world so this is really an enabler to I

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:20,389
think global diversity which you know I

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,309
really like a lot another another point

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:24,019
I'll make is a trend that I'll want to

00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:28,490
keep an eye on for the next year or so

00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:30,980
in in today's keynote nat mentioned and

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,209
went over the mobile developer

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,240
experience something I'm really excited

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:37,670
about because we know that at certain

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,010
places in the world mobile phones are

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,480
critical for access to technology and

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,709
you know in some developing countries

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,709
you wouldn't expect people to have

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:48,180
laptops or desktops everywhere and you

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,790
know phone is just a really great

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,860
enabler so I'll be really curious to see

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,040
how this trend evolves and I hope that

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,290
we'll see even more representation from

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,000
developing nations in these steps one

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,639
fun point I will point out from the

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,160
numbers is free private repos was

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,980
literally in every continent right and

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,610
we even saw as some free private repo

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,660
usage in Antarctica yeah I'm going I'd

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,139
love to know where they're doing down

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,320
there yeah absolutely

00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,050
and speaking of grossing Asia I want to

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,910
focus on China and India for a moment we

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,769
have seen users from these two country

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,050
grows significantly in the past few

00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:30,089
years we're so happy to see them

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,000
leveraging our open-source community and

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,860
making contributions at the same time so

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,350
Steven from your research and experience

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,899
is that something you think elsewhere

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,670
yeah so you know really what we see are

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,380
in a to Rachel's point I mean the

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,880
numbers that were beginning to see look

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,560
more like what you would expect based on

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,329
population right

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,820
they've been artificially constrained in

00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:52,079
many cases you know due to you know sort

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,240
of a variety of barriers they can be

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,370
language it can be procedural it can be

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,870
you know essentially attitudes or

00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,100
philosophy towards open source there's a

00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,690
lot of different sort of potential

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,959
impediments what we've seen certainly in

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:06,059
recent years is sort of the the active

00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,280
elimination of these in some cases the

00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,589
some of them have just subsided sort of

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,530
more more naturally more gradually but

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:16,290
you know basically for you know both the

00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,510
sort of the projects themselves are

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,160
better positioned today they are

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,589
designed in many cases to be more

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,089
accessible to global audiences you know

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,380
in both directions right so in other

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,270
words you have projects that start in

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,640
sort of a broad I'm thinking things like

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,130
tid be that position themselves you know

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,049
sort of expressly with an attitude to

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,110
try to bring in contributors from North

00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,240
America and vice-versa but then it sort

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,490
of just as importantly you see outreach

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,290
from individual communities so in other

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,350
words you see many many more foundations

00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:49,080
participating in and organizing and

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,570
putting on and in fact events you know

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,700
in China in India in different locations

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,720
to try to make sure that the expectation

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,100
isn't always well

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,320
yeah if you want to participate you have

00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,790
to come to us right instead we will come

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,890
to you and we will bring these projects

00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,960
in our expertise and our people abroad

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,210
so you know really what we end up saying

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,160
is is that the demand for development

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,960
talent is such that you know people will

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,570
go literally all over the world to get

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,790
it and part of that you know part of

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,370
that process and part of that is sort of

00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,660
bringing them on board is again trying

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,090
to ease some of those restrictions

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,240
trying to ease some of those those

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,560
factors that would otherwise in sort of

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,030
limit you know the participation in open

00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,250
source communities so we expected to

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,140
continue yeah absolutely we see user

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,920
from those two countries are catching up

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,670
very fast

00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,190
yeah our community at github is both

00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:40,050
diverse and interconnected and that's

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,640
why as this year's report we want to

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,560
share with you how millions of our

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,780
developers are interconnected with each

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,700
other when leveraging projects and

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,220
libraries on github which have become

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,680
the core dependency in their work on

00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,990
average a github repository can depend

00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,620
on two hundred three other packages an

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:01,200
hour top of twelve open 50 open source

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,610
project serve as dependencies for over

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,490
3.6 million

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,110
downstream project repositories it

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,120
should also be noted that many of these

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,310
packages many of these projects of

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,500
packages themselves in fact many of them

00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,350
host over Henders of packages in their

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,360
ecosystem Rachel from Europe's

00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:21,690
perspective how do you see this trend of

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,520
interdependency yeah I mean it's a

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,310
really exciting trend these numbers are

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,780
phenomenal and actually staggering you

00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,450
know obviously companies big and small

00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,210
are really on board with open source and

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,100
you know it it's it's easy to understand

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,010
why right let's say I'm writing a

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,260
product or project and I want to do some

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,760
string manipulation I'm gonna try to

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,470
write that myself and probably not gonna

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,180
test it very well I'm probably gonna

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,450
make some mistakes it's gonna be buggy

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,490
why would I not just depend on a very

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,990
robust package that's extremely well

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,750
tested that has lots and lots of

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,640
real-world usage out there right just a

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,920
much more logical thing to do so that I

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,170
can spend you

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,000
my precious time and all of our time is

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,890
precious right we can spend our time

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,200
working on the sort of core

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,150
differentiation differentiated value

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,210
that we want for our business so I think

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:13,460
you know that's that's really part of

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,550
the explanation of the interconnection

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,260
but another trend that I I see that is

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,060
very positive and this is something I've

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,220
thought about a lot in my career over

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,200
time and I'm thinking about a lot of

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,900
github as well is healthier dependency

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,120
management so you know for sure we're

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,610
always going to see lots of copying

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,650
pasting vendor dependencies that's not

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:37,160
going to go away anytime soon but I do

00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:39,230
really love the the trend towards better

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,750
dependency management and so using

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,550
metadata files to describe modules for

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,830
instance this is a evolution of the go

00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:49,790
programming language which I think is

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:52,250
extremely positive so you know these

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,410
evolutions can help give more visibility

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,510
to people into what they're actually

00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,220
depending on and a better understanding

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,010
of how their dependencies are changing

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,060
which is really important to establish

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:05,810
confidence in you know this

00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:08,180
interconnected universe and you know it

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:11,110
also enables features so for instance

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,520
when you understand your dependency tree

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,890
that enables features such as getting

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,570
alerts when you know package needs

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,210
updating or when there's a security

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:22,340
vulnerability to fix for instance and so

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,010
this is something that you know github

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,960
is working on a lot I will do a shout

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,160
out to add two announcements that were

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,770
made and then in the keynote this

00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,290
morning as well so I think github

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,300
packages is a really interesting product

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,820
in this space allowing you to do things

00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,530
like see a diff between releases which

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,870
is part of that being able to understand

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,340
what you're depending on right and then

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,440
the other one I'll call out is a little

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,560
different it's the github sponsors

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,690
program so I think one of the sort of

00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,690
factors that can cause reluctance to

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,400
rely on open source is this idea of you

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,980
know what if I build my business around

00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,960
this open source technology and then it

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,120
becomes unfunded the maintainer --zz go

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,340
away you know will I be in trouble so

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,890
github sponsors really provides an

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,290
avenue to add some stability to the

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:10,070
ecosystem by providing funding to key

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,510
maintainer

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,130
I think that'll be an interesting thing

00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:16,100
to track over time as well

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,410
definitely and speaking of packaging

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,600
even is there any best practice you can

00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,520
share and what and I'm curious to learn

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,080
the latest trend in the industry as well

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,900
yeah I don't know if it's so much the

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,580
best prime I mean well so the two things

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,290
I know early and my career kind of

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,760
startled me right so I had the

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:34,010
experience you know when I picked up

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,590
when I first picked up Linux I got

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:38,630
started on a distribution called Gentoo

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,090
Linux so I don't know if they're any gen

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,820
2 users in the audience here but

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,110
basically anybody's used of any you know

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,490
Linux distribution has had this probably

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,990
same experience at some point which is

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,940
you know you're introduced to the

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,700
concept of this package repository right

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,350
so in other words if I want MySQL if I

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,270
want you know sort of you know the

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,040
Apache web server whatever I want it's

00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,240
just a command way right and coming from

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,160
other operating systems you're like why

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,440
doesn't everyone do this I mean this is

00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,060
you know it's a revelation on the one

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,490
hand on the other it really shouldn't be

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,840
right it should just be the way that you

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,970
know things happen so had this

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,220
experience in a certainly learning so

00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,170
this technology way back when and yet

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,640
you know one in a sort of as an analyst

00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,870
we would go out and talk to sort of all

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,300
these difference off our engineers in

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,470
charge of projects and you know sort of

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,600
the importance of that moment really

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,610
hadn't proved connected to the actual

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
project so as an example I won't name

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,670
names here

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,260
there was a database project we talked

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,140
to and they said well you know hey we

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,340
think we have this better project and

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,810
you know we you know we're really

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,010
getting sort of outgained you know from

00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,960
usage standpoint you know why do you

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,430
think that is and we talked to them and

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,110
said well okay you know guess what

00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,030
they're in the Linux repository and

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,380
you're not and you know they had come

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,850
back and said well no no you don't

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,920
understand we have a better database and

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:51,170
we had to go back and say yeah I

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,020
understand that in your opinion but it's

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,700
in the repository so the point is it's

00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,680
basically that packaging really matters

00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,760
the industry I think as a whole has

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,830
really started to get this you know

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,420
certainly packaging you know is now

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,650
commonplace not just in operating

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,000
systems you know runtimes you know

00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,070
various languages and so and Rachel

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,990
mentioned you know go is sort of one

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,060
example I'd spend most of my time these

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,380
days and our our has a very very vital

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,350
you know sort of package system called

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,360
cran so you know that the net is is that

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,160
you know basically the best practice

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,660
honestly is is that think about the way

00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,550
that users are likely to encounter your

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,130
software and think about how best to

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,960
package it to make it convenient for

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,950
to use right because depending on what

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,150
you're doing in depending on how it's

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,770
gonna get used there's gonna be some

00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,050
different type of packaging mechanism

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,670
some different package network but you

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,080
really have to invest a time to think

00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,940
beyond just the boundaries of your

00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,440
project you have to think about how does

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,570
your project actually get in somebody's

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,340
hands because historically you know

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,990
there has been a tendency you know

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,460
Tennessee in the industry to say you

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,140
know and you know best engineering wins

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,820
and not only doesn't the best

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,860
engineering win every time it doesn't

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,630
win most of the time in most of the time

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,860
the best package then easiest to consume

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,380
software is ultimately what ends up

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,330
getting used so you know basically the

00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,740
best practice is make sure your

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,840
packaging however you you know that

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,910
makes sense for you to do that's very

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,240
simple but also very insightful thank

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:10,120
you for caring

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,540
our community is both interconnected and

00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:16,030
diverse however security is always on

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,160
our mind in the last year we have seen

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,620
your help to remediate over seven point

00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,930
six million security alerts and in

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,910
addition to that dependable has helped

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,880
to emerge over two hundred thousand

00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,590
automated fix via poll requests so

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,630
Rachel and Steven both a question for

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,240
both of you how do you view the relation

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,410
between interdependency and security and

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,440
do you think we can strike a balance

00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,570
here it's a great question Kathy because

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,080
so far we've been really talking all

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,730
about the value and the positive side of

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,190
source but for sure there's a risk

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:51,730
inherent on depending on the fast-moving

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:54,910
open source ecosystem and so companies

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:57,460
and individuals really need tools to be

00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,560
able to both trust and verify the

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,620
integrity of their software development

00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,870
supply chain and so that's everything

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,480
from commits through releases through

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,740
public packages and these stats you know

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,030
they're they're really exciting they're

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,920
really great step in the right direction

00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,930
when we think about you know where we

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,470
were last year but there's still so much

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,030
more work to be done you know that

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,620
security is not github x'

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,720
responsibilities alone but we really

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,880
want to enable the community and the

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,380
world to get better at security so this

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,810
is everyone's responsibility from

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,350
developers maintainer as to security

00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,430
experts and researchers and so on and so

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,550
we really want to build the ecosystem

00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,720
and the capabilities I'm sure it's super

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,640
stressful to be a

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,250
Tanner and you have to worry about you

00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,650
know what's going on so you know we all

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,540
play a role in securing the world's open

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,490
source I think there's going to be some

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,620
cool announcements in tomorrow's queue

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,750
you know focused on security but I do

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,090
feel like we have a really long road map

00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,920
to figure out so we have all sorts of

00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,250
ideas about you know we've started using

00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:02,050
ml to help identify bad actors sooner

00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,170
right and you know there's lots of

00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,820
technology advancements that can help

00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:10,330
you know one call out I did want to make

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,820
is I'm very excited that github has

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:15,070
recently welcomed the folks from Cemil

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,080
to the github family so those are a

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,360
group of people who are really good and

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,430
code intelligence code understanding

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,800
experts and great security researchers

00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:26,080
and they're certainly going to help us

00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:29,440
build the capabilities we need to help

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,410
enable communities to get more secure

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,640
code over time yeah I think from our

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,080
perspective really depends on who we're

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,310
talking to right you know so in other

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,260
words if I'm talking to an individual

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,150
developer you know look I've been in

00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,220
I've been in your shoes like the

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,560
security work is often not very fun it

00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,000
can be very tedious it's not something

00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,410
that you know you necessarily want to

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,870
you know spend time on you'd rather be

00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,920
adding new features and sort of doing

00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,450
things that are more intellectually

00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,660
interesting in many cases but the

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,250
flipside is is that you know the you

00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,600
know sort of prospect of being paged in

00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,830
the middle of the night because you know

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,200
hey you have this vulnerability that's

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:04,270
been introduced and it's causing you

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,670
know sort of X sort of issues you know

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,560
you really have to sort of be willing to

00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,850
invest in to take the time and more

00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,020
importantly these days to take advantage

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,280
of the tools and services that are out

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,010
there right so whether they come from

00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,310
github Burnie or anyone else you know

00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,600
you you know really need to be able to

00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,890
you know take that you know take

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,530
advantage of the resources that are

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,940
available to make yourself to make it

00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:27,010
possible I guess to deliver more secure

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,780
applications nothing is going to be

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,160
completely secure of course but there

00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,170
are some simple things that you can do

00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,910
typically again depending on sort of

00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,500
what you're doing you know to produce

00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,930
higher quality you know sort of lower

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,610
vulnerability output but then we're good

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,630
as a tional speaking for the flip side

00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,730
of it is is that when we talk to

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,500
managers and so on frequently it's they

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,610
give their team's time right because

00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,320
there's such a pride you know there's

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,810
such a priority place these days on

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,000
velocity understandably so then one of

00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,140
the things that sort of

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,990
you know something has to give somewhere

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,410
and in many cases one ends up falling by

00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,090
the wayside

00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,070
is that sort of attention and focus on

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,630
security so you know like I said you

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,770
know for for individual developers yes

00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,540
you have to care but you know the

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:06,150
managers themselves have to give the the

00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,710
teams you know enough time you know to

00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,500
go through and to do that the types of

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,650
analysis that's going to again read in a

00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,050
sort of result in in lower defect code

00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:20,490
definitely security is always our

00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:24,360
priority at github in 2019 there are

00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,670
over 370 language exist on github while

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,950
the popularity and usage trend change

00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,220
over time something special has happened

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:34,800
this year for the very first time in our

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,720
history python has all ranked a java

00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,400
became the second most popular

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,170
programming language on github by the

00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,420
count of repository contributors so

00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:45,800
Rachel what do you think is behind the

00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:48,840
growth of Python well this is super cool

00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,850
Python you know it's just easy to learn

00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,180
it's a flexible and it's just an

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,830
extremely useful language I mean I think

00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,950
Python was probably the last language

00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:01,710
that I used you know I spent a good

00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,500
chunk of my career focused on research

00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,420
in engineering productivity and as part

00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,060
of that the teams I I worked with did

00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,400
research into language adoption and

00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,800
language productivity and you know we

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,780
would often find that while Python

00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,050
wasn't you know the most people's

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,330
primary software development language it

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,490
was a lot of people's second language

00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:26,070
meaning that tons of people are using

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,540
Python some of the time which makes a

00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,090
lot of sense given how you know

00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,920
practical it is and how easy to use it

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,500
is right that being said there's

00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,150
something else behind this uptick in

00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,010
Python right which is really this

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,710
explosion of work in the data science

00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,600
and machine learning space so yourself

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,060
as a data scientist I'm not sure we rely

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,910
heavily on Python which is you know part

00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,700
of that story tensorflow is also one of

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:53,430
the most popular open source projects on

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,740
github right and you know for tensorflow

00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:57,060
we see thousands of direct contributors

00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,980
and when you look at the dependency

00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,070
graph we see tens of thousands of

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,860
indirect contributors so you know that

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,570
is you know

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,780
part of this story of the growth of

00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,580
Python there are also lots of other

00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,730
packages frameworks and tools that are

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,620
that exists in the data science space

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:16,630
about natural language processing and

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,700
machine learning and so on that are all

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,370
leveraging Python so I think that's part

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,170
of the story definitely as a Python user

00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:25,809
myself like you said I was very excited

00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,010
I've made my fair share contribution to

00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:29,350
this result yeah

00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,480
and finally we also want to share with

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,830
you some other language was impressive

00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,770
growth in the last year for instance

00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:38,410
dart which has grown over 530 percent

00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,700
and other language with impressive

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:43,000
growth including Russ

00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,710
HCl codling typescript and more so

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,820
Stephen one last question for you what

00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,679
do you think is behind the growth of

00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,710
this language and do you think these are

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,320
just fast so the short answer is no

00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,400
they're not fads you know as as I sort

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,470
of talked about at the top you know red

00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,460
mark is is a company that has long sort

00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,990
of preached you know sort of the

00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,400
empowerment of developers and frankly

00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,140
there's no better evidence for that than

00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,360
a term like this right so in other words

00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,620
if you go back 20 years you know with in

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,200
most enterprises there were one or two

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,730
sanctioned languages you know that we're

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,740
permitted to be used in sort of business

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,940
applications and so on and now I mean

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,780
you can have a single application that

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,190
might have three or four or five

00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,440
different languages in one application

00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,090
right and why is that it's because

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,010
developers have now become empowered to

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,630
say you know what this language is not

00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,460
the best tool for this job I can use

00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,679
this other in a sort of this other

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,610
runtime it's more appropriate so you

00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,200
know sort of that being said you know

00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,400
basically we see three characteristics

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,040
two languages that tend to grow in our

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,250
rankings the github get on language

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,559
rankings extra or half of ours and the

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,820
three sort of characteristics that you

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,340
know sort of our most common and that

00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,230
the successful languages arise up the

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,360
charts are versatility so raychel refer

00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,919
to this with with Python discuss the

00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,090
fact that you know you can use it for

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,799
glue code over here you can use it for

00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,940
AI ml you can use it for data science

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,980
you know have lots of different sort of

00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,240
potential use cases and you know you see

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,500
this in languages like Java which is

00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,260
stuck around for a long time

00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,150
Java you know grew up is originally it

00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,610
was designed for cable set-top boxes and

00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,900
most people forget that it sort of more

00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,700
from there into hey this is how you

00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,380
build business applications but has

00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,110
since sort of you know grown out into

00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,790
you know there's whole classes of

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,290
databases that have been written in Java

00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,179
you know it has a mobile story you know

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,809
sort of via Android and so on so it's

00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,039
versatile

00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:20,110
enough to find in a sort of different

00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,080
homes you know so that tend to be in for

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:25,110
one factor in success recently more

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,190
recently a focus on security so

00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,629
specifically on that list rust and

00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,549
typescript you know which have come up

00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:34,179
and we typescript was one of the fastest

00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:35,379
cars we've seen ever in fact and what we

00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,090
you know we hear when we talk to

00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:39,159
developers is that you know they want to

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,049
use tools that are going to sort of make

00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,539
their applications more secure by design

00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:45,490
without having to invest a ton of sort

00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:46,779
of effort into them but then you know

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,220
particularly in type scripts case the

00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:50,019
third characteristic that we see in

00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,820
terms of successful languages are those

00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:53,889
that are able to piggyback on top of

00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,029
large existing communities right so

00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:58,029
typescript you know obviously can

00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:59,860
piggyback off of off of JavaScript

00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:02,080
Kotlin you know which is on the list

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,220
here can piggyback off of Java so when

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,539
you have you know when you're not

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,940
starting from scratch would you can

00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:09,310
intermingle with a large existing code

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,230
base or large existing code bases but

00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,149
also large existing populations and

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,490
users it just makes it that much easier

00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:16,839
to sort of get going so you know those

00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,490
are a couple of factors that we have

00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,800
seen sort of historically and we've been

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:23,139
tracking languages now for probably 10

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,700
years 10 11 years those are the things

00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,740
that tend to be most successful over

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,589
time that's very interesting thank you

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,720
for sharing the insights with us when

00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:33,490
putting together October's report we

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,800
were so amazed by all the work and

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,210
contribution you have chief last year we

00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,399
want to say thank you for continuing to

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,929
view the October's with us and thank you

00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:43,839
for giving us a chance to share the data

00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:46,450
with you any closing thoughts Kathy

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,069
thank you so much for this session thank

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,869
you for doing such a great job in

00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:51,609
pulling the data for the report along

00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:53,470
with your team it's been such a pleasure

00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:55,510
to be here today and Steven thank you

00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,640
for bringing your industry expertise to

00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,319
the table this has been a great talk and

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,060
I really look forward to seeing how the

00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:03,630
world continues to evolve over the next

00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,280
year thank you

00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:34,119
[Applause]
