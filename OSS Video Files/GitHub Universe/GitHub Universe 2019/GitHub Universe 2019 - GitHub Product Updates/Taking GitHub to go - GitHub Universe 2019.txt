00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:29,859
hey everybody thank you for joining me

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,480
today my name is Ryan Nystrom I am the

00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,300
head of mobile engineering here at

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:39,070
github and I'm gonna take you through a

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,629
deep dive of github for mobile so before

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,430
I get started I want to go through a

00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,839
quick agenda some of the things that

00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,570
we're gonna talk about we've got about

00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:48,670
30-40 minutes I'm gonna start off

00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,129
explaining a little bit about what

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,469
github for mobile is where it came from

00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:55,989
and and why we decided to build this now

00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:58,149
I'm gonna walk through a bunch of the

00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:01,210
problems that github for mobile solves

00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,769
and probably what is most exciting run

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,619
through a bunch of features and demos

00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:07,479
for you and lastly I'll end on a bit of

00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:10,060
a road map talk about where we are today

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,580
and where we see this app going in the

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,720
short and long term and then I think

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,619
we'll have a few minutes at the end for

00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,929
some Q&A as well so for starters let's

00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:22,330
recap what we announced at the keynote

00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:27,960
this morning we are launching fully

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:31,110
native apps for Android iPhone and iPad

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,960
these new apps will help you triage

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:38,920
collaborate and organize your work on

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,189
github we announced in iOS beta starting

00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,670
today at github calm slash mobile and we

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:47,229
have an Android beta coming very soon so

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,250
let's take a little bit of a step back

00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:54,250
and talk a bit about why now get-ups

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,500
been around for more than a decade we've

00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,530
dabbled in some other mobile apps before

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,780
but now we're making this huge effort so

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,840
why now why do we want to why do we want

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,149
to launch these apps when get-up started

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,440
it was based around one thing and that

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:14,049
was get-get was kind of a hard to use

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,000
tool if you saw Neha's presentation this

00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:18,040
morning I was the same way with like the

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,660
little post-it note on my laptop trying

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,459
to figure out what all of these commands

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,769
meant github made that simple over time

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:30,030
github has grown and added things like

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:32,470
issues pull requests code search

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,160
notifications and tons more stuff

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,570
including github actions so many things

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,270
there's been one thing in common and

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,960
that's to use any of the stuff you've

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:48,250
needed a computer and that's what github

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,530
for mobile is here to solve these apps

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,890
give you a connection into all of your

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,870
work on github as an engineer I like to

00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,730
look at our app almost like we're SS

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:03,610
aging into a really powerful machine so

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,590
we wanted to solve three problems the

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,130
first one and probably the most obvious

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,680
is how do you take github to go get up

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,320
like I was explaining is a huge platform

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,209
with tons of stuff we didn't want to

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,830
just try and squish all of those

00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:22,660
features into your tiny screen but at

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,540
the same time we wanted to build

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,630
something that was new designed and

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,580
engineered specifically for mobile yet

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:34,060
is familiar to the people that have been

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:38,350
using github for 11 years we also want

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,959
to help you stay better organized we all

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:45,700
use our phones for messaging email

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:48,070
tracking to-do lists it's we're all so

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:53,530
used to having the most important stuff

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:55,300
push straight to our but there we go we

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,739
want to make sure you can we want to

00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,100
help you stay in the loop with your work

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:03,310
on github and the last one which isn't

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,080
necessarily a problem today but is more

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:08,260
a problem introduced by adding a new

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,019
platform to github and that's how do we

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,420
fit your workflow with over 40 million

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:16,150
developers using github across the world

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,049
we have a lot of options with hardware

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:22,300
software environment configurations

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,940
not to mention all of the accessibility

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,340
needs that some of us have how do we

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,490
make sure everyone has access to github

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,650
for mobile wherever they are let's drill

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,740
into the first problem area and talk

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,600
about how we took get up to go like I

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,390
said there are so many things that you

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,360
can do on github what we decided as a

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:46,050
design and engineering is to focus on

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,580
giving you quick access to your

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:53,599
work we also know that a core part of

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,949
github is collaborating with your peers

00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:59,909
we want to make sure that you can

00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:02,430
handoff from your browser to your phone

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:04,340
seamlessly almost picking back up on

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,349
your work wherever you are

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,889
so for quick access we've done a few

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:13,680
things on the home screen you'll notice

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,050
this top section called my work here we

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,759
have issues and pull requests these will

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,949
be things that you are assigned to you

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,949
created even pull requests where

00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,900
someone's requested your review beneath

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,419
that will be your top or repositories

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,569
that you interact with and contribute to

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,729
and at the very bottom are organizations

00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:37,110
that you belong to this way you can just

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:38,969
open the app and tap into stuff below

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,940
that is the favorites section that I

00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:44,759
talked about this morning here you can

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,150
search for all repositories on github

00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,409
and simply pin them to your home screen

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,630
for those that contribute to a ton of

00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:55,289
repositories this gives you access to

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,060
the most important ones and then at the

00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,979
very bottom is your recent activity

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,190
issues and pull requests that you

00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,289
created and commented on I've been using

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,270
this personally whenever I create a pull

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,580
request to my computer and take the dogs

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,800
on a walk I can pull my phone out and

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,529
I'll see that pull requests listed here

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,659
at the top I can open it and see my CI

00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:21,029
status comments or if any of my

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:23,310
teammates have given me a review but

00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:25,680
that's getting to some of your work from

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,139
inside the app what if somebody's asking

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,270
for your attention outside the app we

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,340
also added Universal links so that

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,529
whenever you tap on a link for github

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:40,229
it'll open straight into the app and

00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:42,930
navigate to that content at the top of

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:45,360
the home screen is a plus button you can

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,029
tap this plus button and it'll open a

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,430
new issue creation flow where you can

00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:51,270
add a title description select a

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,029
repository

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:58,349
any one on github and then save the

00:06:54,029 --> 00:07:00,320
issue I think that my team will vouch

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:03,530
for me that I use this Khan

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,810
whenever I see bugs or I have feature

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,690
ideas in the app I am pulling the app

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,930
out filing a quick quick issue and then

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,390
putting it away this to me has replaced

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,460
the need to track all of my ideas and a

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,740
separate app and then later when I'm

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,480
back on my computer file them all as

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,770
issues I can kind of cut out the

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,960
middleman if you're not exactly sure

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,870
where to find something we also included

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,430
global search for all of github here you

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:37,370
can search people depositories orgs even

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,310
the issue and pull requests it'll show

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,530
up in these mixed results once you've

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,710
found what you're looking for we have

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,530
native views for all of these surfaces

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:51,020
here we're looking at a user profile and

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,960
you can even tap into more things in

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,900
this profile at the top there's metadata

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,800
about who they are what they do where

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:03,020
they are but you can also see this users

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,250
pinned repositories and tap into some of

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,920
their lists like items that they've

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,930
starred also I want to call out the

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,790
follow button which is really great so I

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:15,440
can keep in touch with all the people

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:17,600
that I want to follow repositories also

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,360
have native views you can scroll to the

00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,540
bottom read their readme Browns issues

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,280
pull requests search for things you can

00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,990
even browse through all of our

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:33,380
repositories code with this gorgeous

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:35,270
syntax highlighting on and right and

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,250
well if you're like me you spend a lot

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,320
of time reading through issues and pull

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,200
requests so we put a bunch of effort

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,730
into making this view awesome

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,100
all of the markdown like I mentioned

00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,500
this morning is rendered natively at the

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,570
top there's metadata about the status of

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,630
the issue or pull requests as well as a

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:57,560
timeline below comments reviews and

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:59,540
other activity if you need to know more

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,400
about the issue or pull requests you can

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,400
swipe up from the bottom and we have

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,680
this cool card where you can see the

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,190
labels and more you can also leave

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,290
comments at the bottom of the comment

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,940
bar we also have markdown helpers which

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,070
include image up

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,620
once again I think the team will vouch

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,960
for me this is how I leave bug reports I

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,120
take screen shots of the app or

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,450
something else that I'm seeing annotate

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,110
the screenshot and can upload everything

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,850
straight from my phone if you have

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,680
permission to edit the issue or pull

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,920
requests on this sheet will be edit

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:42,500
buttons here you can assign review at

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:45,500
projects and more we also have files

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,110
changed for pull requests if you want to

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,120
see the diff for everything in the pull

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,900
request you can browse here see

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,550
deletions insertions and changes once

00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:02,120
again with syntax highlighting I'm a

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:03,590
huge fan there it is and when you want

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,330
to leave a review on a pull request you

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,020
can do that too you can swipe up from

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,450
the bottom

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,260
leave a comment approve or request

00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:15,110
changes our team has branch protections

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,390
enabled which means that we can't merge

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,060
anything into master without an approval

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,400
on our pull request the great thing

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,400
about the app is when somebody is in

00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,990
need of merging a pull request maybe for

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,120
a critical bug or some last-minute

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,180
changes and I'll tell you in the last

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,470
month or so we've had a lot of those

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,890
we've had to merge all of these things

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,690
in and if my teammate is waiting for

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,480
somebody to be at a desk before they can

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,910
approve it slows the entire team down

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,200
now we can get a hold of each other and

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:51,050
unblock our peers from our phone and

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,160
then we also have our merge status CI

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:57,170
approvals and more and then the button

00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,050
at the bottom allows you to merge

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,490
straight from the app I mentioned this

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,430
morning that I felt like this gave me

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:07,730
superpowers and that's because you can

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,800
start your CI or CD from anywhere in the

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,810
world now I want to tell you a story

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,750
about us building this app where this

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,990
became really apparent and we have our

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:21,920
entire app backed by github actions not

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:25,730
just for CD or excuse me not just for CI

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,990
for running our tests but also for CD so

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,210
when the tests pass

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,400
we can deploy and distribute new

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,440
versions of our app and there was a

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,560
moment when we first added this merge

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,270
button where I tapped it in about 30

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,430
minutes later while I'm out running

00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,200
errands I get an alert on my phone that

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,660
I have a new build ready to install

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,700
which I did and could immediately start

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:53,420
playing with it and testing new features

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:57,280
I was nowhere near my desk the next area

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,870
is helping you stay better organized a

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,110
lot of us get a ton of github

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,000
notifications if you're like me you get

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,860
so many that it almost gives you this

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,660
like sense of dread when you get back to

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,240
your computer that you don't want to

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,160
filter through them then a lot of times

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,590
I've been out just knowing I'm gonna

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,450
have dozens of notifications that I need

00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,900
to filter through before I can actually

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,880
start working we worked with the

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,980
notifications team here at get up to

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:30,730
bring the new notifications experience

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:33,020
to calm us and Android you'll see

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,000
familiar features from the original

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,850
version of notifications refreshed

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,040
things like saved but you'll also find

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,090
brand new features and I'm gonna walk

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,950
through some of them save is a feature

00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,920
that existed on the original version of

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:52,070
notifications while it was useful where

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,750
this really shines is with mobile say

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,220
you get a notification for something

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,670
that you know is going to take at least

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,930
an hour or more for you to dig through

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,420
instead of trying to do all of this work

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,280
from your phone you can simply swipe to

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,110
save the notification and when you get

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,490
back to your computer and have a little

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:13,310
bit more time it's there ready for you

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:15,320
now we've also been listening to a lot

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:18,410
of your feedback about the state of

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,720
notifications I've developed this really

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,690
nasty habit where I will leave a

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,700
notification unread and not open it

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,350
because I'm afraid that once I've marked

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,810
it on red it'll disappear from me

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,870
forever we've listened to your feedback

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,540
and we created something new and that's

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,540
this feature called done instead of

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,250
leaving notifications unread you can

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,230
instead read them and they won't

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,450
disappear anymore and when you're done

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,120
with a notification you can simply swipe

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,700
it away now it's even easier to use

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,830
github notifications almost as a to-do

00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,700
list and finally reach inbox zero

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:57,470
and speaking of inbox zero we partnered

00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,630
with the illustration team here at

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,200
github to create these gorgeous inbox

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:07,520
zero states that really encouraged me to

00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,590
leave my inbox empty when you want to

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,620
filter your notifications say you have

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:15,380
too many you can open up the filters

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,150
tray we've got filters for save filters

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,940
for done like the things we just looked

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,800
at we also have filters by repository

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,280
which existed in the original version of

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:28,580
notifications but this new one is custom

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,790
filters on.com you can create custom

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:35,510
filters for your needs for your team for

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,880
mentions per repository and more all of

00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:43,190
those custom filters are available to

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,930
you on the app and the other thing we

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,680
announced this morning was push

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:51,230
notifications will send you a push

00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:55,270
notification anytime someone mentions

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:57,650
you in an issue pull request or comment

00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,830
when we started adding push

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,480
notifications it became completely

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,270
apparent that if we sent you an alert

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,040
for every single type of event on github

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,250
your phone would be dinging and buzzing

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,700
like crazy and that completely dilutes

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,839
the value of adding these features so

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,260
instead we will only send you a

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,570
notification for a mention you can tap

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:24,080
right on the notification and it'll

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:27,080
navigate you into what the notification

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:32,780
is from then you can let somebody know

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:35,510
that you've seen it the last problem

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:39,440
area I talked about was how do we fit

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:41,870
github for mobile to your workflow those

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,950
of us with phones have so many options

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:49,370
for hardware software operating systems

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:52,280
versions screen sizes and more and then

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,040
we can set up our phones for our needs

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,710
I want to walk through how we made this

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,510
app work for basically everyone and I

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,820
want to start off with the iPad version

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,530
of the app now like I said in the

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,540
keynote we didn't just blow things up

00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:08,030
but we created a bunch of custom

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,430
elements for the app one of the ones I

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,560
want to demo here for you if you recall

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,680
back to the slide where I swiped up and

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,660
was looking at reviewers the signings

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,660
labels and walks through the commenting

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,370
flow instead of stretching that bar

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,740
across the entire screen

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:27,440
when you're on an iPad will dock this to

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,860
the bottom right you can still swipe up

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,620
on this card to expose it and view all

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,690
of the information like before and when

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,990
you tap on comment it enters a

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,340
commenting mode but say you're not you

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,200
don't totally remember what you were

00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,780
looking at maybe you want to go back and

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,630
copy your text you can swipe down to

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,720
minimize this comment com copy something

00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,910
navigate away and then simply swipe back

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,820
up on the comment sheet continue your

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:58,970
comment paste and do whatever you need

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:04,579
to do then simply tap send

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:07,430
and it'll post your comment we also

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,020
added tons of keyboard shortcuts most of

00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,959
the same keyboard shortcuts you would

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,290
find on github.com will exist on your

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:18,020
iPad and instead of using the arrow keys

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,520
we give you them controls like J and K

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,850
so that you can navigate around your

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,850
inbox

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,799
in addition to building iPad we've also

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,330
added accessibility features for those

00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,669
that need to use the app with things

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,429
like screen readers brightness settings

00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:39,309
text sizes and more the app is totally

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,840
accessible in this demo we're walking

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,630
through the app using a screen reader

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,820
and there's no audio but the voice is

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:50,710
reading out all of the elements and you

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:52,750
can DoubleTap to navigate and then for

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,870
the night owls out there we also

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,580
announce this morning dark mode now I

00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,480
think our dark mode experience is

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,240
awesome

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,240
it follows operating system settings or

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,700
your own custom overrides we went

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,460
through every single screen of our app

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,399
and made sure that it was designed

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,620
specifically for dark mode and if I

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:17,379
haven't raved enough about having syntax

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,960
highlighting in the app we also built a

00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:29,019
dark mode specific syntax highlighting

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:30,909
theme forget up for mobile and we worked

00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:33,460
with our design team to create a color

00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:36,639
system for the entire app we support

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,799
light dark mode as well as high and low

00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:42,220
contrast modes if you need a little bit

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,409
more brightness to see and we didn't

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,830
just invert our color palette for dark

00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:50,379
mode we actually created a semantic

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,440
color system for things like text

00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:57,519
actions buttons even background

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,549
elevation our design team also created

00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,730
an entirely new icon set based off of

00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:05,649
github 'aa Ridge '''l octa cons and

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:13,450
totally vectorized for mobile they look

00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:16,029
amazing and we also announced this

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,909
morning that the iOS beta is available

00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:21,129
starting today so again can head over to

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:23,559
github.com slash mobile and sign up

00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:25,779
you'll get an email invite when your

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,389
signup is ready with installations of on

00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:31,870
how to install so a little bit more

00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:34,539
about our roadmap we have the iPhone and

00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,630
iPad beta available today the Android

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:38,520
team is hard at work

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,800
getting close to an Android beta that'll

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,810
be coming very soon and we'll be

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,250
reaching general availability for both

00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:50,520
apps launching together early 2020 but

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:54,120
what about beyond that we want to make

00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,490
sure our app stays extremely focused we

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,580
want to drill even deeper on our current

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,730
feature set we want to make sure

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,500
notifications become even more powerful

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,540
we understand that notifications can

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,790
sometimes be a nuisance and we want to

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,490
give you tools and controls to take

00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:14,730
breaks or silenced notifications during

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:17,730
the weekend we also want to go deeper on

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,290
code review when we started this app we

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,920
told ourselves there's no way we ever

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,240
want to write code or go line by line

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,130
but now that we have the app in our

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,770
hands and are using it every single day

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,990
we want absolutely more power and more

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,050
control to give better reviews to our

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,660
peers

00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:39,000
so that's github for mobile I'm excited

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,650
to see how taking get up to go will help

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,540
you stay better connected to your work

00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:52,860
and I'm really looking forward to your

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:54,810
feedback thank you and I think we have a

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,610
microphone running around so if there

00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:02,100
are any questions I am happy to take

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:04,680
them would the mobile app poll to

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,570
support get a better price the mobile

00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,640
app does not work with github Enterprise

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:10,620
yet we are exploring how to make that

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,140
possible it will work with github

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:20,870
enterprise cloud but on-premise it is

00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,870
being explored a couple over here

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,279
hey maybe it was shown but do github

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,570
actions show up in the mobile and can

00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,870
you interact with them if they're in

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,090
there when you're looking at the merge

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:39,690
status of a pull request you will see

00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:41,399
the results of all your runs so you can

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,549
see your github actions and if you have

00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:46,769
your own see our CD runs the Addis the

00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:48,840
pending success failure will all show up

00:21:46,769 --> 00:22:04,830
there and you can tap on them to jump

00:21:48,840 --> 00:22:07,230
into details one up in the front hi I

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,389
noticed that there was accessibility up

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,970
there is there anything in particular

00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:15,600
that the team is proud of when it comes

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:18,299
to accessibility built-in yeah there are

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,639
a number of features so the one that I

00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:23,070
demoed on stage is voiceover which if

00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:25,889
you haven't used it is a way for anybody

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,139
with a visual impairment to actually

00:22:25,889 --> 00:22:30,779
total blindness to still be able to use

00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:32,549
a phone so we made sure that the app is

00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,860
compatible with voiceover and you can

00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:36,029
still navigate without actually seeing

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,149
what you're looking at and just

00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:42,539
following the audio instructions we also

00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:45,389
have color and version support so if you

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:47,970
need to invert the colors you can text

00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:49,919
sizes dynamic text sizes and honestly I

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,230
would include dark mode as one of our

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,029
accessibility settings well it's kind of

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,190
a nice feature and it makes it's it's

00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:58,350
different and it looks pretty there are

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,419
those that need that the bright lights

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,760
of their phone is a puts too much strain

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:06,649
on their eyes so we're also very very

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,649
proud of that thank you

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,690
do you envision the app having a fully

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,730
featured IDE base capability so that you

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,300
can actually clone and actually make

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:22,970
commits we are really interested in

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,620
exploring having an ID in the app at the

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,780
moment though we don't have any code

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,570
editing features we wanted to start

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,630
really focused and making this an

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,550
amazing like collaborative app as well

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,800
as a consumption app so that you can

00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,630
read issues and pull requests and we

00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,540
want to start with some of the important

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,590
actions that don't require you

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,510
constantly being on your phone so

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,570
merging and commenting and those sort of

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,570
things

00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,280
are there plans to bring support for

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,159
repository and organization

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,890
administration into the app well that is

00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:07,990
a great question absolutely we will be

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:11,080
bringing administration controls for

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,730
orgs and repos absolutely well we wanted

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,370
to start with issues and pull requests

00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,600
so that you could do things like

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,789
assignees and labels which is more on

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,429
the triage space but you can also close

00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:24,159
lock and those sort of things with

00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:27,580
issues but yes we it is on our roadmap

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:35,710
to add more repo and work admin thank

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:37,950
you one in the back I saw that you can

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,510
comment generally but can you also leave

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,240
line by line comments in the code in

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,820
code view yeah so that's one of the

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,400
things I mentioned in our what snacks at

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,650
the moment in the beta today you can do

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,289
just a single comment and approve

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:56,679
requests comments or sorry comment or

00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:58,360
request changes but we actually are

00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,640
going to make sure that we have line by

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,470
line commenting available before we

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,470
launch to the entire public

00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:20,249
hi quick question how much of the

00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:22,559
information that the app uses is

00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:25,139
contained within the phone versus the

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,499
relying on the connection to the cloud

00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:30,360
that's a great question

00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:34,139
majority of the information that the app

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,509
is using is from github.com and that is

00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,860
honestly mostly a security feature we

00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:40,110
want to make sure that all of the

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,820
information all of the code and

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,740
everything is living on github and the

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,409
app is communicating securely with

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,600
github before we are like pulling files

00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:50,600
onto your system quite yet

00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:58,230
what about integrating with the phones

00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,460
mobile payment system can you expand on

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,399
that a little more so like github

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:05,129
sponsors or paying for your subscription

00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:07,619
for example yeah that's a great point

00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:09,929
it's something on our minds but we don't

00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:14,809
have plans for github sponsors or other

00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:14,809
kind of like payment OS integration yet

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,520
do you have a easy way to type out code

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,740
in the comments so the tilde to say this

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,990
is monospace this is another one we do

00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,530
if there's a on the markdown shortcut

00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:38,690
bar there's a shortcut so that if you

00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,809
select a bunch of tap texts you can

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:54,740
either do like a single line rap we also

00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:57,650
have code block quick actions does this

00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:01,130
support SSO and would I be able to

00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:03,530
manage my devices it does support SSO

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:06,260
I'm speaking from experience because

00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:12,049
github uses SSO and we've been using the

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:16,280
app to build the app was there a second

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:18,350
part do you repeat the second part would

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,549
I be able to manage all my mobile

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:24,500
devices in admin PI no and like

00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:28,429
deregister if I get a new phone for

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,200
example you can so the the app will

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:32,450
upgrade just fine if you're restoring

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,970
from a backup the app is also a no off

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,950
app and so if you ever had you lost your

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,130
phone or had security concerns you can

00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,320
revoke your OAuth token from a

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:48,380
completely different device and remove

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:50,840
access for that app are there any plans

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:54,049
to open-source the app or its component

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,120
good question we don't have any firm

00:27:54,049 --> 00:28:01,970
plans to open-source the app yet but it

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:04,340
is on our minds hi can you configure the

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,010
app to send more push notifications and

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,780
than just mentions absolutely yeah we

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,750
want it to be really careful when we

00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,760
started with push notifications but not

00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,890
only is adding more granular controls

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,410
and round schedule do not disturb in

00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,299
those sort of things we do want to look

00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,160
into other sort of push notification

00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:25,130
events so things that might be really

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,440
important to you for instance security

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:32,600
events new pull requests from particular

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,190
teammates and more I was wondering if

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,240
you guys have a document viewer like

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,270
PDFs and CSVs

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:46,590
oh yeah we do not yet we're rendering

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:48,000
images and plaintext so far what were

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,140
some of the biggest challenges and how

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,860
did you guys overcome them some of the

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,190
biggest challenges timeline was one of

00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:01,830
them

00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:05,490
we built this app really quickly this

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:08,880
was also a really major change for

00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:11,580
github actually having a client app we

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,520
have the desktop app but adding a client

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,200
app that people can have with them on at

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,120
all times it's almost able to

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,000
communicate with github at at any point

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:26,270
in time required kind of rethinking how

00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,270
a client would communicate via our API

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:35,190
have you been doing any thinking about

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:38,070
catalyst or any like Mac so if you are

00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,900
familiar with catalysts this is a new

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,570
technology from Apple which basically

00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,490
lets you take an iPad app theoretically

00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,390
click a button and then you can have a

00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,540
Mac app we've played around with it it's

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:54,120
a lot harder than Apple let on and

00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:56,190
doesn't totally work yet it's something

00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,020
that we would love to do to at least be

00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:02,280
able to use the app a little bit more

00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:04,170
often for ourselves it's not totally on

00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,440
the roadmap yet you know we have github

00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:10,140
desktop which i think is an amazing

00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,180
github product so we've played with it

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:17,040
it doesn't totally work as easy as we

00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:20,220
would like but that's about that one up

00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,350
front over here so yeah going off of

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,240
something you just mentioned how has the

00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:27,120
development of this app influenced the

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,550
github API oh that's a really good

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,680
question so we used the graph QL API for

00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:33,780
everything in the app we've been

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,800
actually contributing to the graph QL

00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:39,630
API improving things fixing features and

00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,310
will actually be I believe there will

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,800
actually be some graphical changes that

00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,660
we end up pushing public that we needed

00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,560
specifically for the app and I think

00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:52,930
make the API just better as a whole

00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,930
a couple over here

00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:05,450
question is is the app based on totally

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,370
public api's it is not not quite yet

00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,530
because we have the app still in a beta

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,330
stage we don't want to totally push

00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:14,900
these things live yet until we make sure

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:17,290
the app is stable hi how do you

00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,340
anticipate github mobile opening

00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:25,190
resources in emerging open source

00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:27,050
countries that's a great question I mean

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,150
at the end of the day we want to make

00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,760
sure that everybody is able to connect

00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:34,760
to github from from everywhere there are

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,530
a ton of Android users on github and a

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,940
majority of github users and

00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,010
contributions come from outside the

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,220
United States so want to make sure the

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,290
app is working on older Android versions

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,870
as well as in low bandwidth environments

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:51,250
I envision this gives a lot more people

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,250
access to using github

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,810
all right well thank you all very much I

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,430
will be here at the event if you have

00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,430
more questions thank you

00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:38,679
