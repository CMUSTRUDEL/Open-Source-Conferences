Description: 
	Ed Huang and Max Liu’s project Codis, a proxy-based high-performance Redis cluster solution, went viral in China five years ago. A year later, when they went to build TiDB and then TiKV, they used those learnings to their advantage—with the goal of building database solutions for and by developers all over the world. In this talk, Ed discusses the challenges they faced when building a global product, and their solutions, like using a bilingual content strategy and prioritizing global community governance and management.
