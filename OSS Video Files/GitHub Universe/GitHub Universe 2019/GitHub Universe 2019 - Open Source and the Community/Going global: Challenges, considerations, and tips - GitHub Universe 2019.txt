Title: Going global: Challenges, considerations, and tips - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-12-13
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Open Source and the Community
Description: 
	Ed Huang and Max Liu’s project Codis, a proxy-based high-performance Redis cluster solution, went viral in China five years ago. A year later, when they went to build TiDB and then TiKV, they used those learnings to their advantage—with the goal of building database solutions for and by developers all over the world. In this talk, Ed discusses the challenges they faced when building a global product, and their solutions, like using a bilingual content strategy and prioritizing global community governance and management.

source database corekai DB and you may

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:10,410
notice that my title is CTO so basically

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:14,190
I usually talk about technology and an

00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:17,460
attack mostly but today I'm going to

00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:21,149
talk about the community community and

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,110
open source and I'm working in

00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:28,229
disability assistance for many years and

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:32,459
unlike most of the engineers I start

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:39,300
started program programming when I was

00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:43,860
about 10 or 11 so basically and you know

00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:48,000
I first time I use Linux and join the

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,179
open source community I was about 12 12

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,440
years old and you know there is a young

00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:59,690
young little boy and we I don't have

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:05,509
many friends back then we can talk about

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:08,489
programming and and and the Linux so I

00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:11,390
so basically the programming and the

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:16,349
open source community is my video games

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:21,120
back then so I think that's the reason

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:25,560
why I started business start a start-up

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,800

vendors yeah basically we we are we are

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,490
we are using columns and rows the

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,220
programming language and I want do a

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,900
quick the way how many of you you guys

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:40,800
have heard about roster before okay not

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,960
everyone but yeah Russ is a is a great

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,980
programming language I think

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,669
you can can't be the great alternative

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:55,900
to simple applause so pink health player

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:59,760
I say pick up this company a player is

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,650
playing a important role in rust

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:07,530
open-source community because we are

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:10,389
maintaining a lot of open-source package

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:14,590
for building this beauty system while

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:17,320
rust like gr PC and raft and rocks TB

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:23,590
and permissions something like that and

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:26,889
also we are how we go users and we open

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:32,280
source all these components and software

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:38,410
in github okay this is the tech-heavy

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:41,740
now it's the CN CF project about the the

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:45,520
program we are building the name of the

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,450
database is tidy B and the system is is

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,950
inspired by Google Google spanner course

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:57,700
banner is globally disputed database

00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:02,169
which is widely used inside Google we

00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,599
read the paper five years ago and we try

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:13,389
to create the open-source implementation

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:18,419
of that system and basically we the

00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:22,570
entire base fix my scalp by a portico so

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:26,789
you can just consider tidy be as super

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:31,090
huge mysql if you need unlimited

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:34,030
scalability and you still want to use

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,539
the database via MySQL query interface

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:40,030
you can you can check out our DB and

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:41,800
yeah it is a distributed my secure

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:47,440
compatible with database we build it

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:51,550
from ground up for now this project is a

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,259
four year old project and it is very

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,210
young and

00:06:54,259 --> 00:07:03,979
the special thing is that this approach

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:06,919
is original is starting in China and you

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,930
can consider if you familiar with the

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,580
the database community you can consider

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:17,720
tidy B's there is a popular new single

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:24,740
database using Google spanner mode oh

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:29,750
yeah okay and currently we became more

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:34,610
than twenty K github stars and we have

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:44,539
more than 300 contributors or around the

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:49,520
world okay so my topics today is about

00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:54,199
how to run the open source community how

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:57,680
to run open source project start from

00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:04,759
China and and I want to share some

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:07,340
insights about the differences in open

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,849
source community and open source

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:15,009
marketing in China yeah

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:18,650
the the first thing important thing is

00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:21,949
in Chinese open source community we use

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:25,610
totally different communication tools

00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:31,069
and we we don't use slack and we use

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:35,599
WeChat and QQ everywhere and it is not

00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:39,469
good and the good content is even cannot

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:44,209
collect it by search engine but people

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:50,329
people use it so we we have to live with

00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:57,260
that and also we chat is more than just

00:08:50,329 --> 00:09:00,010
I am message app messaging app we you

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:04,610
know we shall have a feature called

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:06,780
public account so the company or anyone

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:11,250
else can post a blog post

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:15,900
while we chat and it is becoming the you

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,960
know the major marketing channel for

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,970
most of the the company being in China

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:27,360
which has public account so basically we

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:31,860
we consider our which had as our

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,980
official website official blog so it's

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,790
very interesting and in in China few

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:44,540
people use slack people don't don't use

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,540
slack at all I think but with us and

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,850
also the another interesting thing is

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,630
that we we we do that project governance

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:59,970
why why are we chat so yeah

00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:02,850
and another picture is is github Kidz

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,190
hub universe right and we also use

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,620
github in China it is like a

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:16,770
differential standard for all the open

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:19,920
source project yeah slack let's talk

00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:23,160
about and another important part is

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,280
marketing so you create a new project

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,390
if you want to do the marketing in

00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,380
Chinese market

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,410
II might you may you may use a total of

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:38,370
different ways to do the to the to the

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:41,820
to the marketing but I think the most

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:47,370
important thing the most important thing

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:52,050
to to me is is content marketing and it

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:54,180
really works and but just like I said we

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,710
are we are using totally different

00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,800
totally different channels to to post

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:07,650
your your blog post or to do the

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:12,330
marketing and yeah this is some this is

00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:14,520
some channels I think the the first the

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,950
the the most important channel is which

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,780
have public I just mentioned another is

00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:24,950
true come true who is like the core

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:29,030
in China and it is kind of lie another

00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:32,060
kind of social network so we basically

00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:34,760
our marketing team maintained two major

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:39,980
plat platform in it one is WeChat

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:43,460
another is true and the in the in the

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:46,280
third place is using some social network

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,520
platform like Weibo calm it is like the

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:53,630
the Twitter of of China and yeah and

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,630
some you know individual bloggers and

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,840
another interesting funny thing is that

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:03,530
few people read hacker news basically no

00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,650
one reads hack news I know that if you

00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:09,740
want you around the open-source project

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,990
in the United States maybe you if you

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,020
want to launch a new project the hacker

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,690
news is the the best channel you you

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:23,750
want to you know really announce your

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:27,350
your news but now in China and the folks

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,440
are really like reading techno stuff and

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,710
blog posts through which hat so yeah

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,000
yeah

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:38,810
and of course using Chinese content is

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:45,080
more Chinese content is more popular

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:49,660
yeah is obviously and also we we did a

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:53,450
lot of the the the conference like cucum

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,089
is very popular in China kind of like

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:59,420
the biggest conference you if you want

00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:04,210
to attend kill Kong is the biggest one

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:09,200
another is is is awesome it is another

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:11,870
famous technical conference biggest 10

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,520
year conferencing in China the third is

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,000
I think from my own practice is is cube

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,210
comp

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,420
yeah cube con Shanghai is very huge

00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:29,030
conference

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:33,520
yeah and also like many open-source

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,520
projects we do meetups and

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:45,560
in China the the most popular meetups is

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:49,410
always held by the the project

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:53,190
open-source project itself like ping cap

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:57,140
our company we are hosting the the

00:13:53,190 --> 00:14:00,480
meet-up core infrastructure Meetup and

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:06,690
in past three years we have already have

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:09,540
more than 100 meetups and inning in

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:14,270
Beijing Shanghai or other and other

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:19,529
cities in China and it is really very

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:26,029
useful and on the other hand another

00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:29,970
great meetups is held by some probing

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:34,940
programming language community like Cola

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:39,870
and rust but actually we don't have some

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:43,080
JavaScript meetups or Java we have

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:46,020
things like this and oh there's the

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:49,589
Tiff's and people never use method opcom

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:54,330
in China so you have to find some you

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:59,580
know local website like hold on machine

00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:04,130
calms things like this yeah and the

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:07,890
funny thing is that this is our our our

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:17,190
slack you can see we are using I have

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:19,740
TDD to up to to show all the the

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:22,560
keywords mentioned if anyone tweeted

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,010
about ID be orphan caps we have a pot to

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,740
you know showing our public channel so

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,740
we can reply or something yeah and

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:41,100
speaking of the the community and in

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:45,800
last few years Chinese commit a Chinese

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,800
open-source community and not is not

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
actively

00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,360
at the replay playing with the the the

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,170
foundations like Apache foundation but

00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:03,660
things are going going better in recent

00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:06,209
years like some biggest big companies

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,300
like Huawei and Alibaba are donating

00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:13,320
their their project to to the tooth

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:18,810
foundations like a SF and the CN CF as

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:21,270
you can see but like I said most of

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:25,860
active open source country contributors

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:28,100
are from big big companies in China we

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:36,330
don't have many individual contributors

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:40,890
and always I think from my personal

00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:43,290
observation Chinese company in these

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:47,910
foundations are more like the sponsors

00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:51,930
not the code contributors but I think

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:54,690
things are getting better like you can

00:16:51,930 --> 00:17:00,950
you can see Alibaba play important role

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:07,579
in in CN CF so I think things are

00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:09,329
getting better now and on the other hand

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:15,449
Chinese companies

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:19,140
I said why I said is like the end users

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:22,470
and the Chinese companies and users are

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:28,199
more like the open source adapters

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:31,710
rather than the contributors because the

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:35,790
you know the business of this companies

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:40,980
are growing really fast and the the

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:47,850
users and the company is very practical

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:51,570
and but since I think we are where we

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:54,120
are we are doing well and I can see the

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,350
things are changing because when I

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:00,010
running the TV community I am noticed

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,220
more and more and

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,520
users become the active contributors to

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:11,520
to the to the to the open-source

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:16,030
software that they are using and I think

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:20,830
because we know China have it got its

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:24,630
own culture and so so we have our own

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:30,190
local open-source software community and

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:33,280
I think a lot of popular open-source

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,350
projects in China may be completely

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:41,290
unknown to their to the US community

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:44,560
like I have example like CODIS I'm the

00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:48,850
I'm the author of of CODIS CODIS is

00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:51,910
disputed read this proxy so you can use

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:55,900
code is to create a disputed radius

00:18:51,910 --> 00:19:01,350
cluster and I created this project

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:05,740
before official read is supported

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:08,680
distributing mode so it is a cooler

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:15,130
feature and I think it is so popular in

00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:21,030
in in China and let me see we got a lot

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,030
of kidnap stars of this project and

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:32,140
yeah and this this project is more than

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:37,470
ten thousand case and hundreds of of

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,470
company using using this project but

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:49,030
besides Hina is bill completely unknown

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:52,240
and is yeah but on the other on the

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:57,220
other hand the the popular open-source

00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:02,669
software like communities doctor is also

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,669
very popular in China so yeah and

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:11,590
another another fact is that the users

00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:14,830
tend to believe the influencer and real

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:23,080
case studies and so if you are you want

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:28,330
you make your project you know get more

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:31,710
adapters you you may need to write some

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:39,450
you know something like use cases and

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:42,160
try yeah speaking of the

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:47,799
commercialization of open source

00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:56,080
software the business side unlike unlike

00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:58,330
the US and we are we making money by the

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,380
the business model is still the the UM

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:05,850
premier is there the mainstream but you

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:10,570
know SAS business is now very successful

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:18,520
in China in recent years unlike us you

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:23,020
know but because in China the the the

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:25,990
engineer cost is not as high as in the

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:30,880
US so people are tend to maintain their

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:36,570
own software stack and on datacenter so

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:38,560
and another big reason is the chest

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:42,480
because

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,780
right now the traditional uses

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,770
traditional companies are still not very

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:55,870
casual to the cloud based architecture

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:59,230
so still on premier is to the mainstream

00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:02,890
business model but I think think

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:06,660
things are getting better and this year

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:11,340
thoughtful thing cap we transfer or

00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:17,050
transfer or our business model to the

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:20,560
service subscription model and according

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:24,250
to my observation the things are coming

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:28,810
well and on the other hand I think

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:32,110
another important reason why Chinese

00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:35,620
market matters is if you are early-stage

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:40,000
open source project if you want to get

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:43,180
more users get more adoptions to polish

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,150
your your project and the Chinese market

00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:51,420
a China China is a excellent market for

00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:57,580
for a new open source project because

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:59,440
this is it is not a news that if you are

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,080
a US company if you want to try

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:08,280
something new you have to put a lot of

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:12,330
effort in researching or the or the

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:16,120
other projects in the same area so you

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,670
maybe you can do the you you have to do

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:23,550
the research for for ha half an year

00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:27,910
just to pick up the to pick up one but

00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:30,100
most of the the Chinese uses I just want

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,880
to solve their their problem as quick as

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:39,760
possible so if your purchase really can

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:44,440
solve the problem and people they just

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:48,160
use and so I think for for the open

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,830
source project Chinese market have more

00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,000
potential users and shorter adoption

00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,120
cycle

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,070
and on the other hand of course for you

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,530
for for us if you know we are we are

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:02,230
building a database it is a very hard

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:08,220
core project so that that means we have

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:13,030
few fewer competitors in China yeah I

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:18,870
will take a pink app and tidy B as an

00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:21,550
example to show how we we do the

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:27,750
community governance and community

00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:32,800
management in China and this is the

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:37,900
community organization tree we learn a

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:41,710
lot from the Apache foundation and in a

00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:45,640
sense EF but we do some some some some

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:51,550
new roles like reviewer and active

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:54,870
contributor because we we won won the

00:24:51,550 --> 00:25:05,910
organization like job later so you can

00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:05,910
everyone had had has their roles so yeah

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:19,210
our community work what workflow the

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:22,690
center is is is a slack even though the

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,360
outside community doesn't use a slack

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:28,420
but internally we use slack to connect

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:35,410
all the tools we are we are we are we

00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:39,460
are using let's take example for example

00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:46,330
internally we are we are using JIRA for

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:49,450
hours but for the backtracking but why

00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:53,440
why we use JIRA where we maintain the

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:57,970
internal JIRA is because it is because

00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:01,690
some of the the bug or issue is reported

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:04,090
by our paid customer some of these may

00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,030
contain some confidential information so

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:10,930
we we have to maintain

00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:15,240
we maintain the internal JIRA - to check

00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:18,220
the issue and box but what if the and

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,850
also we still have a lot of community

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:25,420
uses and community users may use github

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:31,240
issues to post the bug report or

00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:35,050
something so we write the boot robot -

00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:40,120
now to synchronize the keeper issue to

00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:50,580
our internal JIRA platform yeah this guy

00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:57,190
s re-put and the the workflow of

00:26:50,580 --> 00:27:00,490
contributor or or we can say if yeah we

00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:06,690
are we are running a color wheel in

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:09,870
github and in our case we have a lot of

00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:13,300
test cases test cases

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:16,530
internally we are we are not open source

00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:24,880
all the test cases because it is so huge

00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:28,500
we have testing farm we running in our

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,970
data center is composed by hundreds of

00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,660
physical knows it is a disability

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:37,120
assistance

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:39,760
- running disability test and yeah but

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,820
what if the contributor contributed a

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:48,160
new feature but they they want to run

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:54,690
they want to see the the tested result

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:57,820
so we also build a boat for for this and

00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:00,880
yeah I notice that this this morning

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:03,220
could have announced the github actions

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:10,950
so maybe we can use that feature in the

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:16,470
future but for now we we are using a

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:20,700
boot - - to check the

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:34,800
to toggle the the the internal test you

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:40,890
can see this yeah yeah okay and from the

00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:45,140
the content strategy in stipend cab we

00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:47,970
have ten people team focusing on

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:51,330
internationalization because people are

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:54,390
using Chinese in China of course but we

00:28:51,330 --> 00:29:00,210
still want our contain because you know

00:28:54,390 --> 00:29:04,040
a lot of users not is non Chinese so we

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:08,060
have to provide English content for the

00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:10,830
community so we we have a

00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:13,350
internationalization team most of them

00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:17,400
are technical writers to translate

00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:23,850
Chinese documentation and blog post to

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:27,630
to English and this team also maintained

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:34,200
the order marketing channels like hacker

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:40,890
news and treat her things like this yeah

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:44,490
and of course we the law if you you are

00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:47,310
a project you want your open-source

00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,520
project you want to go into China the

00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:53,490
localization is also important so my

00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,730
suggestion is not sing holy rewrites the

00:29:53,490 --> 00:30:02,190
content from English to Chinese or from

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:04,650
Chinese to English is I I suggest you

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:11,760
know you you have to write in the native

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:13,250
way yeah also beside the traditional

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,210
online

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:20,160
unlike marketing and project governance

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:24,030
we are also running some offline events

00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:30,000
light like training yeah this really

00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:32,550
works and recently we launched in

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,730
project we called Thailand plan because

00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:39,590
you know we are we are using last

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:43,580
programming language it is a very young

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:46,920
programming language so we found that

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:51,120
the big biggest blocker is that we don't

00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:54,810
have enough rust programmer in China or

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,990
all over the world so if want to grow

00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:00,180
grow if you want to grow the community

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:03,990
want to get more contributor the first

00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:08,180
thing we need to do is to you know to

00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:11,520
write some rust cause and the rust

00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:17,070
content to help people understand rust

00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:21,540
and help them to you know to Maiden more

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:28,830
predict practical rust programmer so we

00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:31,410
write tutorial help the engineers to you

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:35,010
know use rust to create writing

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:36,900
distribute assistance yeah this this

00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,810
life practical network application in

00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:44,220
rust we create a lot of tutorials to

00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:48,210
help users to have the community

00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:51,650
understand how to use rust or go through

00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:58,410
to to write each with assistance and

00:31:51,650 --> 00:32:02,940
also we had we held the the Hexen we

00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:07,350
have our hex on every year and I would

00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:11,790
say Haxton is a great event and it

00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:15,240
really works and I I think we can call

00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:21,060
ourselves hackathon driven company

00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:25,320
because most of our non most many of our

00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:30,330
important features is created in in

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:34,700
hackathon by our engineer or the the

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:38,280
community uses yeah and also another

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:42,960
important event is the project

00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:44,530
conference like github universe we have

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,040
our own

00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:53,470
conference court ITV Def Con is we held

00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:58,600
last like last year there are more than

00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:03,480
one thousand attendees to the 230 be Def

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:10,710
Con in in Beijing so it's very popular

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:15,340
and if you want to run the the the

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:19,480
Chinese open-source community I think

00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:25,720
you are you'd better to create a the

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:28,960
Chinese form we have one week all asked

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:34,120
who G is you the users can post

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:37,480
questions issues while this website in

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:43,030
in Chinese and we will periodically move

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:48,190
these questions to kidnap issue and in

00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:53,320
translated to English so that the users

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:56,380
can you know they can using search

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,960
engine search the the issue keywords

00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:05,650
they will have Chinese content and

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:10,750
English content at the same time there's

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:15,070
some tips to help have the project on in

00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:19,650
the contributor friendly community is my

00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:24,640
own practice the first thing is that

00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:31,000
remote remote first engineers like like

00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:34,900
us we don't like talking to real people

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:40,900
so we we always discuss discuss online

00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:45,880
so yeah another is of course put the COC

00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:51,040
on your or your project so yeah it is

00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:53,650
also very important and I think for the

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,720
the the biggest blocker of the

00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:06,070
the kind of new contributor is the the

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:08,410
first commit so for us for me I I will

00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:11,440
help on if if you want to contribute to

00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,840
our project I if you reach out to me I

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,200
will help you to hands on to get your

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,110
first contribution step-by-step so once

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,010
you finish the the first contribution

00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:31,420
and yeah that would be okay in the in

00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:37,570
the in the future and the another kids

00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:41,050
is be open share all the things you all

00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:44,710
things like code calm and style the the

00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:47,530
commit message tell write it in in in

00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:53,500
document we have the new contributors to

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:57,430
get into the community and I'm putting

00:35:53,500 --> 00:36:00,940
you know Peter hub support some poor

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:04,920
Chris and the issue template so you use

00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:08,460
these features and this is very

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,380
contributor friendly and of course

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,620
updates the project row maps and the

00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,690
design documentation to make sure

00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,960
everyone in the community know what's

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:23,560
going on and what will be next

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:27,790
and sometimes you can share the road map

00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:32,680
and feature design in a very creative

00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:36,610
way like recently we hosted shelling

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:40,090
challenge program account we host the we

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:42,040
started the event record it's an online

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:49,630
event we called the performance

00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:55,420
challenge we put some feature proposal

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:59,080
and the design talk in in in the in in a

00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:01,840
project can have issue page so the canoe

00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,869
the community and every issue have a

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:09,999
have a score

00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:13,599
on that so the contributor can if you

00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:18,339
finish this feature and your PR is

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:22,349
merged and you can have you know have a

00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:28,440
ranking board so is it is very

00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:36,940
interesting event yeah yeah this is some

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:39,789
takeaways I think the first thing is

00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,890
that Ronnie the the project only in

00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:47,229
China are boring the US United State is

00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:53,039
not important but keeping keeping open

00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:56,380
and transparent is is very important so

00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:59,140
we are trying our best to lower the bars

00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:02,259
for for the new contributors and they

00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:05,109
help them to and also help them to learn

00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:10,420
the necessary knowledge like like even

00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:12,640
like health health then to to to learn

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:17,890
the program we language programming

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:20,380
languages things like this and the

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:23,799
second second takeaway is that using

00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:27,430
some automation tools and creating some

00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:31,239
puts that may make made your life easier

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:35,499
if you want to maintain the large

00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:38,019
community and localization is very

00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:42,039
important and it's especially for

00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:45,190
Chinese market so I say the best if you

00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:48,599
want to run the open-source project in

00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:52,479
China you're entering store the rich hat

00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:55,839
ok the last thing I want to want to say

00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:58,469
this that we are we are living in the

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:03,160
complicating what sometimes is

00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:08,819
frustrated but you know engineers like

00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:10,349
us like you and me are working together

00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:12,910
every day

00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:18,520
collaborating every day to create better

00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:20,520
software so I think

00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,860
we are not consider ourselves is a

00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,830
Chinese open-source project or the

00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:32,530
United States open-source project we

00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:38,560
just open source project so thank you

00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:42,550
and this is my talk and you can check

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,150
out in github give me give us a star

00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,150
thank you

00:39:45,880 --> 00:40:19,539
[Applause]
