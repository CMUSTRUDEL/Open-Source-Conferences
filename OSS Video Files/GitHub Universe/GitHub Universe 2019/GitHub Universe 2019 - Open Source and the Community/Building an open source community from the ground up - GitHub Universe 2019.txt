Title: Building an open source community from the ground up - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-12-13
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Open Source and the Community
Description: 
	Presented by Stefen Fejes, UI Engineer at 30 Seconds

Wonder what's it's like to grow one of the fastest growing open source projects before graduating from high school? Since it's release, 30secondsofcode.org was nominated as the 6th fastest growing open source project by GitHub in 2018, gathered over 45,000 stars, made it to Hacktoberfest trending lists, and started series of education projects used by thousands of developers daily. Growing an organization of this size isn't easy, especially when a newbie is running it. Stefan will share some of his most inspiring and challenging moments of running the organization—and share tips for maintainers and teams starting their own open source projects.

[Music]

00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:22,029
thank you so much for joining in I

00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:23,800
really appreciate it

00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,410
it feels so awesome to be here after

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,469
more than 30 hours spent in the air and

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,599
flying from Serbia to San Francisco my

00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:33,129
name is Stefan and as few organizers of

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,110
this conference already told me I'm

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:37,329
actually the youngest speaker at this

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:41,769
year's good have universe conference so

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:44,079
that's kind of unique I know thank you I

00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:45,790
know the bio says I'm 19 years old but

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,149
as you all know time flies so I had to

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,009
turn 20 years old at some point as a

00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,049
front-end engineer I mostly worked with

00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,549
JavaScript and I usually joked that I

00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:56,080
have a black belt in JavaScript so

00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:58,809
there's a reason why this year this

00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,759
Karate emoji and the reason why I'm here

00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,739
today is actually to talk about open

00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,540
source and I'll be talking about

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:06,790
building an open source community from

00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,079
the ground up so here are some projects

00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,450
that have done in the previous two years

00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,130
season started by coding journey the

00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,130
last one is this called accessibility

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,710
guide it's just a guide to help you make

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,960
accessible websites and all this one

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,140
most popular one is this called one

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,260
called 30 seconds of code so today we

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,550
are going to learn from our mistakes and

00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,310
you're going to hear some tips and

00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:33,280
tricks on how we managed to grow one

00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,560
project from zero to more than 50 1000

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,200
github stars so when people in

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,140
conferences or meetups ask me Stefan

00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,790
what is 30 seconds of code about and I

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,530
usually tell them it's a curated

00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,210
collection of useful JavaScript snippets

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,970
that you can understand in 30 seconds or

00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,950
less and you know it's enough for

00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,400
somebody but for more people it needs a

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,860
bit more description so the way we saw

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,750
there is one problem in our community is

00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,970
that when people who are starting to

00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,520
code they usually solve the problems in

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,170
a similar way they found a problem they

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,580
just Google the error message or Google

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,900
the problem and the first thing that

00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,170
pops up is actually the stack overflow

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,629
link or some third party blog post so

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:15,640
they just copy and paste that code into

00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:18,099
their own editor and hope is going to

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,049
work out but unfortunately it doesn't

00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,090
usually work so they go back and copy it

00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:23,680
once again and you know once they're

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,859
finished they think they've done a great

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,329
job but in reality they didn't the

00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:31,150
problem from copying somebody else's

00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:32,829
code is obviously code consistency

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,049
and optimized solutions and most

00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:36,700
importantly the lack of documentation so

00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,099
when beginners copy somebody else's code

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,409
it might work but they have no idea how

00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:44,200
it works and overall we think it is a

00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:45,430
bad onboarding experience for a lot of

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,980
people including the ones who are

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,290
jumping to JavaScript so we created this

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,030
little resources called 30 seconds of

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,250
code it's just a collection of small

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,250
cards where each card represents one

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,260
utility function so if each car has a

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,569
name a description of what a function

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,180
does and a bit more longer description

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,280
on how it works and there is a code and

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,870
on the right hand side you can see a

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,909
copy to clipboard button so you can

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,500
actually copy the snippets into your

00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,540
code editor and use them across your

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,840
projects and we even went a step further

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,730
and added examples so people can

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,959
actually see given an input what is

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,629
going to be the output of the function

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,370
and how it actually works so when i say

00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:26,260
we' i actually mean the community this

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,109
is not a project that I have started

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,980
originally so in numbers there are more

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:35,680
than 380 snippets made by nearly 200

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,660
contributors now and together those

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,180
contributors made over 5,000 commits

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,459
merged more than 800 pull requests and

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,549
opened and successfully sold nearly the

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,440
200 issues so this number might be you

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,810
know big for me small for you but for

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,310
github it was pretty big we managed to

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,019
be the sixth fastest growing open source

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,780
repository of 2018

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,250
and most importantly for us this is an

00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,799
idea that started serious of our

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,169
education projects then gonna talk in a

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,690
second so the question after this

00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:06,760
introduction I get usually is how it all

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,319
started you know a lot of people assume

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,540
that I started coding when I was 5 years

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,720
old or that my parents are from

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,159
engineering backgrounds so I kind of had

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,260
some boost in the early career but the

00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,150
truth is done so let me ask you like

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,210
what was your dream job and you're a

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,210
child a lot of my friends they wanted to

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,280
be like policeman's doctors surgeons

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,560
actors my sister nowadays she wants to

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,960
be a youtuber and a lot of my friends

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,900
back then wanted to be astronauts and to

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,740
drive that those fancy spaceships and my

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:42,099
spaceship was this one so I just wanted

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,710
to be a garbageman I still have no idea

00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:45,040
why but I just like the fact that I

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,200
could

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,000
around the city and enjoy it at the same

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,880
time and doing something good for the

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,340
community and when I think better like

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,930
this is exactly what I'm doing right now

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,190
so I'm doing something that is

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,110
appreciated by the community everybody

00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,860
loves it and I enjoy it so this is what

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,590
fulfills me

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,930
but even then like my first day in tech

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,150
were not that great so originally I had

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,530
to pick a high school to go to and for a

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,750
long time I wanted to be a Lego brick

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,160
designer but my parents didn't know like

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,110
which school I should go to in order to

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,720
become one and back in Serbia that

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,910
school didn't even exist so it wasn't

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,650
worth it so I had to like pick high

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,320
school on my own and luckily there was a

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,830
computer science experimental class in

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,200
my school it was just 20 of us and it

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,090
wasn't great either so I started and I

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,300
had to cheat in high school because I

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,550
wasn't doing so well so the thing was we

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,430
were doing c-sharp and I was sitting in

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,810
the first row of the classroom because I

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,360
couldn't see sharp right I wear glasses

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,250
and back then I didn't work glasses so

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,080
that that was the that was the problem

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:51,790
so yeah I was sitting next to uh next to

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,130
my friend his dad was teaching computer

00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,200
science to the local university so at

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,450
age of 14 like he knew all the data

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,400
structures and algorithms so whenever he

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,500
wrote a piece of code like this I would

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,420
be very smart I would copy it erase all

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,910
the variables and exchange it with my

00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,980
own set of variable names and you know

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,580
it worked for two or three months until

00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:15,310
we were given exercise to to actually do

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,490
some array manipulation so it was I

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,290
think sorting exercise any word like

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,900
swept to elements we needed to introduce

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,520
a third variable called temporary that

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,010
is going to hold the value of the first

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,420
one and the way we do it is we usually

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,670
introduce the third variable called

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,730
temporary in English we short heading

00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,500
short-handed to the TMP but my friend

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,630
was not good at English so he just used

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,950
the variable name TRT and I copy the

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,070
same code exchange all the variable

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,750
names but forgot to change the trt

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,390
variable and that was the test where I

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,820
got caught so at that point I realized

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,260
you know I should get better at coding

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,860
start learning on my own and that was

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,630
the day I got into web development and I

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,490
did my first two internships and it was

00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,960
time for the third one and everybody's

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,090
like you need this tool called

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,069
have on your resume sounds like okay

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,020
let's start and I was browsing to read

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:07,509
it and found this awesome project called

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,880
30 seconds of code it got it just got

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,500
released on that day and I was like I

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,410
want to contribute so I made my first

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,710
full request and thanks to it I felt

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:20,080
like so awesome once I done so it was it

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,759
was awesome feeling so it was just

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,759
because of this guy and his fast and

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,500
responsive fast and supportive response

00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,539
and that was the day I said you know I

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,069
want to contribute to open source and I

00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:32,139
want to maintain this project called 30

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,940
seconds of code and back then you know

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:37,440
we didn't even have a website it was

00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,570
just a readme file with a bit like 20

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,160
functions so his name is Angelus he's

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,570
actually the original creator of this

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,759
project and the reason why I'm here

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,400
standing today so he was finishing his

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,650
master thesis and he needed to get a job

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,659
so the way he practiced it he'd and I

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,710
was lead called lead code and HEC ranked

00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:58,210
problems and he found out that most of

00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,979
those problems were just combination of

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,020
some utility functions so instead of

00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,599
copying them from other resources like

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,370
Stack Overflow he wrote them himself and

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,970
after some time he started collecting

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,220
them so once he got to 20 snippets few

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,440
lies why not just share it and see how

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,090
it works out he honestly thought it was

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,930
like a very stupid idea but it turned

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,300
out to be great

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,130
so the takeaway I want to to make from

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,810
here is to actually let every idea no

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,090
matter how crazy show its true potential

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,969
a lot of fast when we think about ideas

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,349
we think that our they are our ideas are

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:31,539
like very good in the first few minutes

00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,979
but then after that we think like it's

00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:36,789
stupid and nobody's going to like them

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,620
so some tips for finding an idea you can

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:42,700
for example open source some of your

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,810
existing projects and there is probably

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,220
something that you have worked on for

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,430
the last two years

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,170
also you can open source part of your

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,510
working project it obviously doesn't

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,430
make to make sense to open source the

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,980
the whole project because you're going

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,770
to get fired in under a week but if you

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,750
just open source one one portion of it

00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,899
is going to be beneficial for you and

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,120
your company so for example if you open

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,040
source wanting in the social community

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,079
you're going to be perceived as a good

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
company and also your hiring process is

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,930
going to be much much more easy

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,820
because you can just hire people who

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,980
contribute to your project and like it

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,440
already and last but not least you can

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,730
start something new and today we're

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,279
actually going to talk about all these

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,320
three topics and all the tips that you

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,380
are going to hear are applicable to any

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,269
of your projects so as I mentioned I

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,010
made my first commit it was the first

00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,170
day that that project got released and

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,079
the next few weeks were total chaos

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,060
so that reddit post went from zero to

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,519
two thousand kill half stars and it fan

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,230
it felt like a disaster there were

00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,209
hundreds of full requests to review and

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,950
tons of open issues there was no

00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,260
continuous integration and there was

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,820
like a lot of duplicate code and without

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,220
any contribution guidelines to guide

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,769
future contributors on how they can help

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,320
the project so at that point Angelus was

00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,540
like it's not doable for one person and

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,910
he had to form a team so the team was

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,339
formed in in almost no time we just

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:10,390
picked the people who are most engaged

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:12,579
in the early days and I mean obviously

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,500
you you it's okay to start alone and

00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:16,660
general started alone and I joined him

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,579
later on so it's probably the most

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,709
frequent way to start an open-source

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:22,300
project if you do not want to go along

00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,130
talk to people from the community or

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,190
your colleagues and friends and convince

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,290
them your idea is worth making and the

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,329
best thing for me is that if you like

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,130
somebody else this idea just don't join

00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:34,959
them so there are probably a lot of

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,240
projects that you're using that are open

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,100
source and it would be so cool if you

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,440
actually work on something that you're

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,209
using every day and the maintainer

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,820
subject project are going to appreciate

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:48,190
it a lot so I didn't want this talk to

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,930
be just about me so I created this

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,480
repository called killer universe talk

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,029
and invited all of my friends who joined

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,120
the organization early on to hear their

00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:00,010
opinions on it so next slides up till

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,019
the end are just opinions of all of us

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,459
so if you do not like the presentation

00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:08,350
just feel free to open the full

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:10,269
requester issue and yeah so we realized

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,620
that having a great people around you is

00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,899
essential you know through open source

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,180
we develop a lot of friendships and once

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:18,160
we reach like 50,000 stars I told myself

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,959
I would get the airplane ticket and meet

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,490
all the contributors who were active in

00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,950
the early days so there isn't luckily

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,990
that many of them

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,690
and there was one quote from one team

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,829
member his name was Atomics he said the

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,990
team was very helpful in encouraging

00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:33,120
which made the atmosphere to repository

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,279
very welcoming and I felt great to be

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,070
part of it and there specifically this

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,690
part that I really liked and for me this

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,940
is what open source should be like and

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,220
it's not really a secret and how we can

00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,870
get there so the way we get there is

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,930
actually building an amazing developer

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,430
experience around the project and today

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,220
I'm actually going to share with you

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,380
some tips and tricks that I found really

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,139
useful so this is my little checklist

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,630
we're going to cover all of these things

00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,220
and starting with code quality so the

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,370
reason why a lot of people join

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,050
open-source is actually to to learn best

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,120
practices learn on your language and

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,399
they want to actually see the good

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,250
examples of code and if our repository

00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,720
is not well structured it's you know

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,130
it's not going to be worked for them so

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,440
they're just going to skip it and you're

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,779
going to miss your users and the future

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,459
contributors so a few of the tips I give

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:27,750
is to actually stick to a coding style

00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:29,670
guide and be consistent so remove every

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:32,040
clutter that you do not find useful I

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,199
bet there a lot of like and use variable

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,029
senior project or unnecessary files that

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,680
are just making it hard for everybody

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,350
that is coming to the project to

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,120
understand what is happening and for

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,829
example to achieve all of this maybe you

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,560
can use something like code linters and

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,810
for matters on good hooks so for those

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,910
of you who do not but not know the git

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,649
hooks are like triggers for scripts that

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,399
are going to be run before or after

00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:59,220
certain get actions so for example we

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,890
added a linter on pre-commit hook so a

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,019
linter is going to listen for all the

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,630
unused variables or bad coding practices

00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,190
before somebody commits code so later on

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,420
you won't have a problem in reviewing

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,850
somebody else's code because it's going

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,660
to be as good as possible and we also

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:18,360
run for matters on hooks that are

00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,569
happening after the commit was made so

00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,829
we actually don't require people to use

00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:27,089
like spaces or tabs we just like do it

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,370
ourselves we have for matters

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,339
automatically and I'm not an expert on

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,110
code quality so that would be it and the

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,300
next advice that I'm going to give is

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,060
about documenting your code

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,880
it's like probably the most boring thing

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,620
that you you're thinking right now but

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,570
I'm actually not going to talk about

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,620
traditional stuff I'm going to talk

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,480
about writing good commit messages so

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,800
the way we write usually code is this we

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,350
just want to release the feature as fast

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,420
as possible and we usually end up with

00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,920
commit messages that look like this or

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,350
maybe not exactly like this but they're

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,530
usually like one-liners that include up

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,910
to like 20 or 30 changed files and for

00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,830
the next person who comes to our code

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,080
base they mean totally nothing it's just

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,580
a way for us to push the code and the

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,860
idea I had is that we should actually

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,600
tell stories throughout our commits so

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,970
there is specific structure that I found

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,170
out that works great for us and for all

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,600
the people who are contributing to

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,790
organization and this is actually it so

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,650
you start by having a short one-line

00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,170
title of your commit which is actually

00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,940
going to be up to like I think 50

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,190
characters because it's going to be like

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,250
short understandable and actually the

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:37,530
github UI shows up to 50 characters on

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,270
each commit message after that you want

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,100
to provide a longer description of what

00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,760
a change is doing you know if the title

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,050
is not enough if you're using a bit more

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,600
files in there so you should definitely

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,370
like include description of it you

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,320
should also add an explanation of why

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,820
the change is being made a lot of us

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,420
doing open source don't do it full-time

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,190
so when we contribute to a project maybe

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,900
for a week then we make a longer pass

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,580
and then come back to it it would be

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,860
very helpful to know why the change was

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,650
being made and perhaps you want also to

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,200
include a discussion of the context and

00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:11,430
alternatives that were considered

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,220
because we put a lot of effort into

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,110
writing our code and if the context is

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,580
not there the future contributor won't

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,590
be able to understand what is happening

00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,410
in your code and writing commits this

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:24,570
way is very good so for example for

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,090
power users you can just search the

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,980
whole code base and for average user and

00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,590
beginner like me you can install

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,660
extensions like guidelines which are

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,940
going to high so when you highlight each

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,800
line of code they're going to display

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,600
the commit message next to it and this

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,820
way I think you have like every single

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,160
line documented which is exactly what

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,740
you want in in your project and this is

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,550
not something that I came up with so

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,740
this blog post up here is

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,960
actually a very cool one it includes

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,830
like a longer story of what I told today

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,440
and link down there is actually a link

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,330
to repository called get flight rules

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,970
it's a repository that stores like all

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,460
the tips and tricks on how it needs

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,270
self-command github gets problems on our

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:13,210
projects so next in our list our

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:16,490
simplification of onboarding experience

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,560
so in order to like attract contributors

00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,110
you kind of need to to do it in some way

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,820
and the first thing that they see when

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,010
they enter your project is actually your

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,890
readme file so the idea here is to make

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,470
the readme file as appealing as possible

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:32,780
and you know this is our really file

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,160
it's not perfect but some things that

00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,750
you should take care of is definitely

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,300
like having a name and a catchy

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,470
description catchy description is the

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,600
thing that people are going to read it

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,250
first and if it's not good enough some

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,620
of them might just not continue reading

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,120
what the project is about you also want

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,190
to include some kind of fancy graphics

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,870
and those trust badges over there and

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,030
you do not have to be a designer for

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,430
that you can just download some free

00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,440
icons change the color of them add text

00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,850
and create the original order this is

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,030
what we did and it turned out to be

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,440
pretty good and once you include that

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,450
you want to include a QuickStart guide

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,100
so don't just link to Doc's

00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,170
include a Quick Start Guide telling the

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,540
your users how can they benefit from

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,010
your project and what they can do and if

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,450
they get interested by the QuickStart

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,370
guide then you should link like to the

00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,440
documentation so the documentation

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,120
should not take place in the individual

00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,339
file it should be either like in the

00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,660
github wiki page or some third-party

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:29,450
resource and so now they are using your

00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,430
project they figure out how to do so and

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,110
they might be interested in contributing

00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,890
so you definitely want to have a

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:39,340
contribution guidelines and it's a file

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,870
that I'm going to talk about next and

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,520
also you should have a code of conduct

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,410
and license I know a lot of people

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,090
forget about is but those two are really

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,920
important so if people are like

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,630
violating the code of conduct feel free

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,030
to just kick them out of organization

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,290
and also take care about the license on

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,970
the first day because if you don't

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,790
people can actually for the whole

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,680
repository and you know make profit out

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,090
of it so this is what happened to us a

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,700
while ago that it was definitely not

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:08,580
good time so as I said the idea is to

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,260
also write good country contributing MD

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,810
files so those files should actually

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,460
answer a few questions so first of all

00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,200
they should answer like what a projects

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,460
need help with so if I'm the country if

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,620
I'm the person who wants to contribute

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,200
to your project like what can I do in

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,480
order to help you so for example open up

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,800
will request which snippets for the

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,800
JavaScript open issues fix typos add

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,720
tests and a bunch of other stuff and now

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,660
that you told the user how to do what to

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,490
do you need to actually help them on to

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,080
achieve that so for example a lot of

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,940
users are like actually the first time

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,030
contributors so you kind of want to add

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,820
links to the starting guide and github

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,470
and actually github has a lot of like

00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,570
blog posts that are helping first-timers

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,280
contribute to open source so you should

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,070
just link to them and forget about

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,780
writing those on your own and last but

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,060
not least you should include who to ask

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,610
for help so a lot of people put a lot of

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:05,370
effort into composing pull requests and

00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:08,370
they might get stuck at like 95% and you

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:11,010
know it's going to make them feel sad so

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,380
you should just include some resources

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,630
and like who should I ask for help maybe

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,060
include your email or if you're not too

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:21,780
busy like I am offer one-to-one a

00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:24,150
mentorship classes and it would work out

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,920
definitely so when you have the

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,140
contributing MD file it's automatically

00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,090
going to be displayed in the indigent

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,340
hub UI so when somebody is trying to

00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,220
open an issue or start on your pull

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:38,820
request it's going to be up there and

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,440
the idea behind contributing MD file is

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,050
that you should explain everything like

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:46,080
on five so you're probably familiar with

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:49,080
that subreddit li5 it's basically the

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,360
idea of explaining everything to a

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,150
five-year-old and the way I solve this

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,610
is I'm a little diagram showing like

00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,560
what is the contribution process for 30

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,900
seconds of code like so what can people

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,700
do as a first step I can do as a second

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,610
step what scripts do they need to run

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,800
like what CLI commands do they need in

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,200
order to get a pull request and it took

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,750
about 30 minutes to make this but it

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,750
actually led us to more green buttons

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,090
and

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,169
successful prayer requests so this is

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,779
something that you should definitely

00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:21,429
invest time I know it maybe sounds

00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,289
obvious but a lot of people don't do

00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,970
this and because of that their

00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:28,750
onboarding experience is not even that

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:30,399
good and now you kind of want to to

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,179
welcome the first time contributors in

00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,710
some way and for me like the github is

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,429
perfect place to do this because you

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:41,320
have everything set up in one place so

00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:43,389
with over forty million users I just

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,100
think that github is writing I mean

00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:47,230
they're doing like all the marketing in

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:51,700
the social community and people just

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:54,309
seem to to know about it and some events

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,740
like Oktoberfest are a great place to

00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,059
attract the first-timers and I know a

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,570
lot of people that come to Oktoberfest

00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,129
because of the free shirt but you you as

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,889
a maintainer should make this experience

00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:07,419
more than just a free shirt you should

00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:10,149
actually show them what is open-source

00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:11,919
about and after that they want to ask

00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:13,480
this like stupid question if I make it

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,370
pull requests do I get two free shirts

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,379
and yeah so after that you you want to

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,649
know that contributing to open source

00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:25,480
for the first time can be very daunting

00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:28,389
it's so hard to like figure out and how

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,370
to to do so first of all people need to

00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:32,169
find a motivation and motivating

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,519
somebody to do something for free and

00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:36,370
spend their time like their most

00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,169
valuable asset is on its own very hard

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,330
thing to do so once they find a

00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:42,220
motivation like I did for the job

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,720
interview and having the github I need

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,779
to figure out a way on how to contribute

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,509
so a good tip is to actually add those

00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:50,799
good first issue labels to your issues

00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,330
so that people who are new to the

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,000
industry they can actually look up those

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,100
and try to sell some easier problems at

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,240
first so after that you know they figure

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,100
out the ways in which they contribute

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,990
they need to make this little next step

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,019
which is like forking the repository and

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,519
for a lot of people it's like very very

00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,350
strange thing to do so without some

00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:10,809
proper guidelines and introduction to

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,970
the github it's very very hard for them

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,679
to even come to this church step and

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,990
after that you need they need to make

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,639
changes and without good documentation

00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,039
and good contributing Docs

00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:23,180
it's so hard to do so and finally they

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,710
open the pull request

00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,300
you know it might be a good one if they

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,650
done all the steps correctly

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,940
but the chances are low because their

00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,070
first time contributing to open source

00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,110
and they probably missed a bunch of

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,060
stuff in the mean time and we as the

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,740
maintainer are responsible to keep them

00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,510
because it just takes a bit of

00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,790
negativity to remove the motivation we

00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,740
had in the first place so this place

00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,450
over here is the area where you should

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,580
shine you know when somebody opens up or

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,110
requests don't just blame their here if

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,490
they made a mistake point it out but

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,560
also point out on the good stuff they

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,800
made offer help if you think they need

00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,750
it or perhaps if they open up or request

00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,600
but never came back to it after your

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,580
review do a follow up tag them and see

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,940
if you can make it through to the final

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,580
steps and the idea behind this box is to

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,310
be nice to everybody so for example this

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,080
this autumn this October there was a

00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,730
Hector burr Fest and there was one

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,310
project called 30 seconds of interviews

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,740
that I developed and we kind of the idea

00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,690
behind a project is to provide questions

00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,010
and detailed answers for people who are

00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,650
preparing for their web development

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:28,200
interview and we didn't have questions

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,450
on accessibility so I kinda marked that

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,090
as a good first issue for somebody and

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,770
one girl from India she was like she

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,690
wants to contribute so she made her

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,000
first full request it was like really

00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,910
really good and you know this was my

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,670
response to her and you know after a few

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:46,080
days she responded with this and in the

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,330
next few weeks we had a full

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,400
accessibility category on our website

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:53,310
that she developed on her own which is I

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,500
think fantastic so also when

00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:58,230
communicating on a project you should

00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,810
use like the simpler language you know

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,460
from the github stats of this year I

00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,620
think more than like 80% of the people

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,720
are coming from the outside of us and

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,180
it's really really hard to communicate

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,740
well especially on our project my team

00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,170
was very diverse we were coming from all

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,850
over the world English was not our first

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,190
language so we kind of needed to figure

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,990
out a way so the best thing to do is

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,760
actually know as simple English as

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,650
possible without keeping everything too

00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,030
much complicated and also like format

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,690
text nicely so people can actually

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:29,400
navigate more easily around and the

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,500
takeaway from here is to actually tread

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,900
treat contributors like your guests so

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,299
the idea is to make them feel like

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,639
they're at home

00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:41,659
and you know if you do so I think you're

00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:43,549
going to cover all these steps and we

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:45,289
did so it worked pretty great for us we

00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,059
managed to be the first learn to code

00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:49,460
repository that is recommended by github

00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:51,950
when you're starting to learn code and

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,230
we actually managed to announce a lot

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,840
more educational projects such as this

00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:00,799
one called 30 seconds of CSS it's like a

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,720
collection of a bunch of CSS examples on

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,419
how you make like fancy spinners or

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,889
animations or gradients or bunch of

00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:09,799
other stuff for about developers

00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:11,809
I also launched the one called 30

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,730
seconds of interviews so because I was

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:16,009
preparing for a lot of job interviews

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,960
back then I collected around 200

00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:20,779
interview questions and carefully

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,100
written the answers for all of them so a

00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:23,809
lot of people actually got a job from

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,609
this website and it feels so good when

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:27,980
they message me and say like this helped

00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:29,629
us a lot and they're also a project for

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,940
community like this one called three

00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:33,710
seconds of knowledge so one day I was

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,139
browsing the product hunt and the first

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,269
training project of the day was 30

00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:40,850
seconds of knowledge it was a Chrome

00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:43,330
extension that took all our learning

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,909
resources and put them in like a new tab

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,649
space and we're so like upset on that

00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:51,259
day because somebody just took all of

00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:53,600
our ideas and made our Chrome extension

00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:55,940
out of it but soon I realized that the

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,710
guy who made it lives like 50 kilometers

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,440
away from me which is like a half an

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,720
hour drive so it was okay and he moved

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,340
the whole project to his to our

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,779
organization and he's right now

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,759
contributing to it as well which is

00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:09,889
awesome the extension also exists for

00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,570
Firefox if you want to check it out it's

00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:13,100
a cool learning resource it's like for

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,570
example every time you open a new tab

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,570
you're going to see something new from

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,609
our organization and the idea here you

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,859
see all of those successful projects as

00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:24,049
organization we made I don't know over

00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:26,539
like 80,000 github stars or something

00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:29,239
and the takeaway is not to be anxious

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:32,210
about numbers I mean numbers of commits

00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:34,580
stars traffic Falls issues you know PR

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,259
is going old it just doesn't matter like

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,960
you're here in the open source to enjoy

00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:40,730
your time and there's always going to be

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,249
like one subway station that is a better

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,720
programmer than you are so then there's

00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:47,119
like kind of no point in competing with

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,330
that and I was because I was searching

00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,360
for a job you know

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:54,120
I was doing github non-stop so for every

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,960
Christmas like your graph looks

00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,880
something like this

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,100
mine was getting greener and greener and

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,860
greener and greener so I made a tree

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,640
commits for a Drupal age 83 commits for

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,080
83 unit tests and it was like nonsense

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,210
so and you can even like fake the whole

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,040
github history graph is that your thing

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,750
they're like a bunch of websites that

00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,690
you can draw your own thing and just

00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,450
import that to github directly so there

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,250
is no way in competing with that and

00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:23,430
there is one little tweet from Jason I

00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,530
will look up to him he said the periodic

00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,850
reminder open-source maintainer czar

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,970
doing their best to keep up with a

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,920
firehose of questions bug bugs imperfect

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,810
Docs and so many other tasks that is

00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,950
easy to take for granted please thank

00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,990
them and be kind to open-source

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,990
maintainer usually they hear only the

00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,310
bad feedback and this is very true so if

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,510
you want to complain to something just

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,430
don't do it

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,080
I mean haters are always going to be

00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,670
louder and their approach and open

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,350
source is something like this you know

00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,360
they just want to fight your ideas even

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,280
though they're using your projects so

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,860
you know if they're hating on the

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,170
project just ignore them kick them off

00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,730
the organization and don't respond so

00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,800
for example this was one conversation on

00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,200
reddit about a little website I think I

00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,210
posted so there was one guy who works as

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,010
a senior front-end engineer in a big

00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,540
company in New York City and he was

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,160
complaining like how one question is

00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,980
very hard that he wasn't able to solve

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,470
it and he was sure that 50 of his

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,330
colleagues he interviewed were won't be

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,280
able to solve it as well and next day

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,050
there was a response from a recent

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,940
graduate from a good bootcamp and he was

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:27,420
like we could all answer that question

00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,220
and no it just makes no sense up to this

00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,320
day and the question was very very basic

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,260
for like the easiest category possible

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,540
so I didn't find like a best way to

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,190
close this talk I mean there is obvious

00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,470
like this quote from atomic from the

00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:44,790
early on that open source open source

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:47,040
should be this so we all want to be we

00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,380
all want to feel great to be part of it

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,630
and I found one gift that explains what

00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,150
we should not be doing so for example

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,800
this is your future contributor he is so

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,750
excited about your project he's in his

00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,080
playground and he just wants to

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,470
contribute to it

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:05,429
and you know he starts there and because

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,720
it's so complicated he just goes out and

00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:11,090
does nothing so this is definitely what

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,470
you should not be doing thank you

00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:43,869
[Applause]
