Description: 
	Presented by:
Stephen Magill, CEO at Muse Dev
Gene Kim, Author, Researcher & Founder at IT Revolution

In this session, you'll hear about the year-long collaboration between Gene Kim (researcher and co-author of “The Phoenix Project,” “DevOps Handbook,” “Accelerate”), Dr. Stephen Magill, (expert in software security and program analysis), and Sonatype (maintainers of the Maven Central Repository). They examined 10,000 open source Java components that were published to Maven Central and hosted on GitHub. They combined team and project performance metrics from GitHub, popularity data from Maven Central, and vulnerability and dependency data from Sonatype to examine what properties are shared by exemplary open source teams. They discuss these findings, including the differences we see between exemplary small teams and large teams, the fact that popularity does not predict security, and how remarkably difficult it is to keep dependencies patched while being “almost” up-to-date. They also highlight the organizational and technology practices they observe among exemplar open source teams, which release new versions 2x more frequently and remediate security vulnerabilities 3x more quickly, all while delivering a level of value that makes them standouts in terms of popularity and adoption.
