Publication date: 2019-12-13
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Open Source and the Community
Description: 
	Presented by Devon Zuegel, Product Manager of the Open Source Economy Team at GitHub

What can cities teach open source about governance, funding, and managing limited resources?

In this talk, we'll take a stroll through von Haussmann's Paris, the subways of NYC and Hong Kong, the streets of Singapore, and modern day San Francisco. We'll look at how the long history of the design, maintenance, economics, and politics of physical infrastructure can inform how we approach our digital infrastructureâ€”and where we'll need to draw a new map for ourselves.
