Title: The city guide to open source - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-12-13
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Open Source and the Community
Description: 
	Presented by Devon Zuegel, Product Manager of the Open Source Economy Team at GitHub

What can cities teach open source about governance, funding, and managing limited resources?

In this talk, we'll take a stroll through von Haussmann's Paris, the subways of NYC and Hong Kong, the streets of Singapore, and modern day San Francisco. We'll look at how the long history of the design, maintenance, economics, and politics of physical infrastructure can inform how we approach our digital infrastructureâ€”and where we'll need to draw a new map for ourselves.

00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:26,359
it is so good to see you all here I'm

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,099
Devin and I'm the product manager of the

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,980
open source economy team at github and

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,419
we run the github sponsors program and

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,150
do a lot of other things for open-source

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:37,040
maintainer --zz and so I'm really

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:44,930
thrilled to talk to you guys all today

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:47,030
so yesterday we announced that github

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,189
sponsors which as a quick refresher is a

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,210
way to financially support the open

00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:53,210
source projects that you depend on

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,820
yesterday we announced that we are now

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,030
able to support organizations to receive

00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,769
funding so if your projects like to

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,689
identify as a team as a group of people

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:05,210
as opposed to just an individual

00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:07,400
developer you can now receive funding as

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,670
a group so we're really excited about

00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,750
this in that theme today I'm gonna talk

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,570
to you about something a little bit more

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,450
conceptual around how groups make

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,060
decisions first and background before I

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,100
started as a product manager I used to

00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,009
be a developer but then I took up an

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,249
interim interim period where I was doing

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:30,259
independent research about open source

00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:32,240
communities and I was I dove deep and

00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:35,299
toq spoke to hundreds of maintainer x'

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,609
and contributors and walked away with a

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:40,189
lot of knowledge that i really am

00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:42,859
excited to share with you all today one

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,560
of the things that really kicked off my

00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:47,869
interest in this space is a good friend

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,649
of mine named Nadia egg ball wrote a

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:53,119
report in 2016 called roads and bridges

00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:55,189
roads and bridges talks about how

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,889
there's all of this unseen labor that

00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:00,229
open-source maintainer --zz do that most

00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:03,770
of which goes unpaid and is on volunteer

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,079
time and I'm somebody who is really

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,360
interested in cities and urban design

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,330
and urban development and I'm a big nerd

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,819
about land use policy so it really was

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,120
very interesting for me to see Nadia

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,220
talking about open source in terms of

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,190
city infrastructure that metaphor really

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:25,160
struck me and pulled me in

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,620
so today I'm gonna combine my two

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,020
interests my love of cities and my love

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,850
of open source and share a little bit of

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,100
the the parallels that I see between

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,900
them so what we'll do is we're gonna

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,320
talk about three parallels and one

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,850
really big difference so as a quick

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,440
rundown we're gonna talk about how

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,410
cities and open source projects make

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,660
decisions how they secure funding how

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,960
they manage congestion and when to

00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,120
define governance so this is all very

00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,500
abstract I promise I'll go more in more

00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,200
detail as we go through the talk so to

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,570
start both open source projects and

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,790
cities have to make really difficult

00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,990
decisions that often affect a lot of

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,970
different stakeholders who have

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,810
different goals and different opinions

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:14,180
about what should happen so to start

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,430
with cities there are I think it's

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,420
really interesting to look at this as

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,720
one primary dimension around how who

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,250
gets the decision-making power is it a

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,980
singular person is it a centralized

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,190
source that gets to make one call or is

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,320
it sort of more of a chaotic and you

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,990
know maybe democratic thing where

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,320
everyone gets to say everyone gets to be

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,720
part of the decision and a very

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:46,730
interesting instance of that first

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,500
extreme is Paris so Paris is one of the

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,840
most beloved cities in the world

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,380
it is really famous for these beautiful

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,030
boulevards that cut through the city and

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,790
the way that they got there was in

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,850
medieval Europe Paris was previously

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:06,500
this warren of very small streets with

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:08,570
no sewage people had were very sick all

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,730
the time it was incredibly difficult to

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,560
get across the city because if you can

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,080
imagine those little areas between the

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
big boulevards that was the entire map

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,770
and so if you wanted to cross the city

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,130
you had to go through this maze of

00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:25,790
little streets just to get anywhere so

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,640
during Napoleon the thirds rain this is

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:32,570
not Napoleon Bonaparte but hit one of

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,910
his sons Sons I think he was an emperor

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,260
and so he got to say exactly

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,700
what was going on and he was looking he

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,440
looked at his streets and he looked at

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,360
the people living in Paris and dying of

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,860
cholera and he said you know what we're

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,890
not going to put up with this anymore

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,320
so he put a man in charge named Baron

00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,810
von Houseman and Baron von Houseman was

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,580
given basically complete reign over

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,290
Paris he could do whatever he wanted and

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,340
one could argue that he had a very good

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,380
impact on Paris

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,500
they now have sewage that's definitely a

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,390
plus they also have these boulevards to

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,870
go through the city but at the same time

00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,360
to create those boulevards he just

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:16,430
sliced through the city with a red line

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,140
and tore down entire neighborhoods so I

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,180
think this is an interesting image

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,340
because you can see exactly where all

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,190
there were houses there were businesses

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,530
there were community centers at every

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:31,550
point where those roads now cut through

00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,060
and Vaughn Houseman just decided you

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,710
know what

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,410
it's for the greater good we need to

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,750
just cut right through an interesting

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,970
contrast is San Francisco which we are

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,490
all familiar with here here in San

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,410
Francisco we have a pretty serious

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,530
housing crisis that I promise I won't

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,690
run rants to you about right now but the

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,700
long story short is that we don't build

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:56,210
very much housing in San Francisco and

00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,940
this makes the prices go way way up and

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:02,180
a big part of the the source of this

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,430
problem is that every person in San

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,260
Francisco gets to have a say as to what

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,419
happens there's this thing called

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,970
discretionary review which effectively

00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,800
means that any given person in San

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,750
Francisco can say you know what I don't

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,090
like that building let's not build it

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:21,169
and this is makes it really hard to get

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:24,410
anything done so the there's a very

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,900
different sort of story here and with a

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,700
very different set of trade-offs and I

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,130
think in open-source communities you see

00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,990
it very similar things in open-source

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,510
communities you have some extremes like

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,250
on on Elm is a really interesting

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,710
example of a programming language where

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,080
there's a guy named Evan who just is

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,850
really talented and has really strong

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,970
opinions about what the project should

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,330
be and when he found it out he very much

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,520
set the tone

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,830
you know this is this is my thought baby

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,380
that I am going to make this my

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,150
brainchild and do it the way I want and

00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,880
I have this vision for what Elm will be

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,100
if you are with me let's go if you are

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,810
not with me that's fine but you don't

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,760
have to use Elm but don't complain about

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,440
it

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:12,300
javascript is on the opposite end of the

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,340
spectrum where JavaScript's is much more

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,810
community driven there's a committee

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,290
that makes a lot of decisions about what

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,850
goes in the formal language and before

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,710
even that you can you can get some

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,150
things inserted into battle battle if

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,630
you want to have your own little flavor

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,810
of JavaScript and this means that

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:33,360
JavaScript both can it can be harder to

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,000
make really major decisions that affects

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,830
everybody but it can also be easier to

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,160
make smaller decisions and have a little

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:45,690
local experimentation so to look at

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:48,030
these trade-offs I think in elm evan has

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,710
made some really hard choices he's

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,150
deprecated things he's made certain

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,440
parts of the language not backwards

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,090
compatible because he's like you know

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,620
what that thing that I built was a

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,450
mistake we're done or like we're just

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,979
not going to support this anymore and it

00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,940
was extremely controversial when he did

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,039
that

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,810
whereas javascript has to be a lot more

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,310
amenable to a lot of people when it

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,750
makes those big decisions because it's

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,000
affecting millions of dela and

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,940
developers all around the world at the

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,360
same time it's quite hard to get that

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,039
little experimentation inside of Elm

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,680
because you have to get through Evan and

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,949
if he's not excited about it or if he's

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,900
busy because he's one dude it's just not

00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,460
going to happen whereas in JavaScript

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,400
land you can play with your own little

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,260
flavor of JavaScript locally play with

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,479
it share it with your friends and if it

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,250
catches on then it could get adopted

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,880
into the formal language over the course

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,709
of years so I don't really mean to say

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,380
that one style is better than the other

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:45,750
and these are also sort of extremes and

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,640
there's a whole range of spectrum in the

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,709
middle but I think it's a really

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,290
interesting way to think about

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,360
open-source communities and when you're

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,400
making the decision of what projects to

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,140
adopt it's one dimension that you should

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,130
consider about which trade-offs that you

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,779
want to take

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:07,180
so San Francisco ended up this way and I

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,620
personally think that we should in the

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,199
case of San Francisco I personally think

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,759
that we should sort of centralized a

00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:15,910
little bit more of the decision-making

00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:18,040
just a little bit because if one any one

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,440
of the 800,000 people who live here can

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,880
can say that a project can't happen it

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,410
we're just not going to make any

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,110
progress however the history of San

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,569
Francisco's land use policy comes from a

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,540
very real place that is quite similar to

00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:38,889
the Vaughan Houseman situation so in in

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:43,329
the mid-century in the mid 1900s America

00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:45,250
was not very responsive to certain

00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:50,050
groups they that we did not really

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,149
listen to the certain communities and if

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,860
you look at this highway map of some of

00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,690
which these highways were built they

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,009
just cut right through minority

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,339
neighborhoods and they were not

00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:02,440
listening at all to people luckily

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,709
before they built all of these highways

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,420
and cut through the V communities San

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:09,639
Franciscans stood up and said you know

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,430
what we don't we don't stand for this we

00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,990
want our voices to be heard and this is

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,000
way too centralized in the planning

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,029
department we need to include more

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,009
people in the community so this is

00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,839
actually a lot of the history for why we

00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:26,170
ended up with the housing policy that we

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,880
have where any any neighbor can say I

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,490
don't want this happening in my in my

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,529
yard and so I actually think it's a

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,360
really hard balance to make and there is

00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:37,480
no right answer here because you are

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,889
always going to either be going over

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,560
people and saying you know we're gonna

00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,240
just centralize this decision and not

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,130
listen to you and that's going to create

00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,930
make some people mad at the same time

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,449
you get stasis if you have to listen to

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,850
every single stakeholder every single

00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:54,370
time and so again I think this is a

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,920
trade-off that communities have to make

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,560
for themselves and there is no right

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,600
answer and the more important thing is

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,829
just knowing which set of trade-offs to

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,829
expect when you go into a project so

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:09,880
this is this is sort of the results of

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:12,790
the

00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,130
these high highway revolts which cause

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,870
people to not be able to build very much

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,759
anymore and so I think that the pendulum

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,680
should swing a little bit more back to a

00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,259
slightly more centralization or slightly

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,029
more representation perhaps as opposed

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:27,310
to listening to every single person

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:33,880
because that creates a lot of misery as

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:36,190
well okay so how to secure funding this

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,199
is something that I think open-source

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,040
communities could learn a lot from from

00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:44,889
certain cities so in Sam in in New York

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,350
City there's a crumbling subway station

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:48,970
despite having millions of trips every

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,589
single day I think it's six million

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,589
trips are made on the New York City

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,509
subway every day and yet they don't

00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,519
really take care of this infrastructure

00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:00,190
at all some of the people in this

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,529
audience may see some parallels with

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,769
certain projects and open source or we

00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,459
just don't we don't invest quite enough

00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:09,910
by comparison

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:12,610
Hong Kong has this beautiful shining MTR

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,730
station MTR is the the company that runs

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,459
the the the the public company that runs

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,500
the railroads in Hong Kong and that

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,240
contrasts to go back to that slide is

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,220
just incredible to me when I when I was

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,810
in Hong Kong about a year ago I was

00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,759
amazed by this great train system and

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,310
the way that Hong Kong does it is also

00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:35,949
the way that Singapore does it they have

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:40,470
this funding mechanism called value

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:43,269
capture and what that does is the the

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,569
railroad company actually owns the land

00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:48,880
around the stations and so when they

00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:50,860
build a new station it increases the

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,449
value of land all around it right if you

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,339
could you could imagine if we were to

00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:57,339
add a new BART stop in some neighborhood

00:12:54,339 --> 00:13:02,160
that would increase the value of all of

00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:02,160
the property there because it's really

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Mozilla tea to the rest of the metro

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,709
area so Hong Kong owns this land and

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,449
then they rent it out and so they

00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,910
actually make money when they create

00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:18,279
value as opposed to just bearing all of

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,559
the costs of that infrastructure because

00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:23,560
again if you think about Bart if Bart

00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:26,020
didn't exist the entire metro region of

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,480
francisco of oakland of east bay all

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,010
this stuff would be much much lower

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,210
because we wouldn't all be able to

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,400
coordinate with each other and

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,110
collaborate and go visit your friend in

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,860
oakland it's really just such a quick

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:40,480
trip over that bay

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,930
unfortunately bart and the new york city

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,880
subway

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,790
don't actually capture any of the value

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,310
that they create their sort of bearing

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,170
all of the costs again and giving all of

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:54,070
the benefits away to the community and

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:56,470
so i think that this is most mostly a

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,420
good thing and we are able to fund some

00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,950
amount of infrastructure this way but

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,920
it's really missing a crucial piece

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,510
which is cycling that value back into

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,180
the infrastructure which is good for

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,650
everybody and so as a result Hong Kong

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,690
and Singapore have some of the best

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,820
transit systems in the world because

00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:17,200
they understand that they have to invest

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:18,940
back into their infrastructure so how

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,110
does this relate back to open source you

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,029
guys are probably all sitting in the

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,350
audience wondering why I keep going on

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:28,660
about cities so I think that open source

00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,910
projects should really start thinking

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,530
about things in these terms and the

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,589
people who use those open source

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:38,080
projects in the companies as well right

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:39,520
now we sort of see open source a lot of

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,530
people see open source as a freebie that

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,300
we can just take and we can take and

00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,730
take but the problem is that if we don't

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,200
put money back into that system it's

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,690
gonna make it a lot harder to take

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,520
things out of it in the future and the

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,860
best part of it of this is when you fund

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,980
your infrastructure you get a lot more

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,170
value out than you ever put in so I

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,240
think this is the mental model that we

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,339
should have for thinking about

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,170
infrastructure much more than sort of

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,510
the traditional route which frankly is

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,150
still born in u.s. infrastructure

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:14,200
systems that we are not investing back

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:15,910
in this is gonna take time New York City

00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,070
and San Francisco still haven't really

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,050
figured this one out it's it's the the

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,330
value capture model of Hong Kong and

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,550
Singapore is still quite rare in the

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,200
world but it's growing in popularity and

00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,580
so I'm just trying to evangelize it

00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,900
everywhere because I think it's the way

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,970
we should think about all sorts of

00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:35,260
infrastructure whether it's physical or

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:37,840
digital okay so a third thing we can

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:40,240
talk about is how to manage

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,640
so in cities congestion looks like

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,100
traffic right you you get on the road

00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,800
and everyone's blocking you and things

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,260
are moving slowly Street is congested an

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,020
open source congestion looks like

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:56,470
opening the pull request or opening an

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,150
issue and seeing that there are 500 more

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,580
in front of you and that the maintainer

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,410
is just super busy and does not have

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,330
time to get to your issue or pull

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,080
request even if it's a super important

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,360
one in cities the way that we manage

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,800
congestion is through something called a

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,720
congestion tax in Singapore again I

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,310
always go back to Singapore as a source

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,530
of really interesting examples in

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,960
Singapore they have this congestion tax

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,910
that says every time you go on the road

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,310
every single mile that you go you're

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,920
gonna get charged a small fee very very

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,420
very small but it's just because when

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,680
you're when you get on the road and

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,230
you're complaining about traffic

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,090
you are also traffic you are creating

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,770
part of the problem and so if you bear

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,020
just a little bit of the cost that you

00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,300
are imposing on everybody else then that

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,740
causes people to only make trips that

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,990
they actually have to make it's

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,120
interesting to contrast this to the way

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,160
that issues work and github or tickets

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,410
work in JIRA or all sorts of things like

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,500
that the or you know message boards

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,030
where it's really really cheap if we if

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,800
we put it in sort of money terms it's

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:07,270
really cheap to open an issue and create

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,920
more work for somebody all you have to

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,400
do is be like hey dude this thing's

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,310
broken

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,800
and then the maintainer is sitting there

00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:16,959
being like ok you didn't really give me

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,550
ways to reproduce it like now I have to

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,829
walk you through this whole process it's

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,000
frustrating and maybe maybe if it's a

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,640
feature request that you've made maybe

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,199
you don't even care really about the

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,690
feature but now you've left the

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,940
maintainer thinking all weekend about

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,770
should I like should I should I respond

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,380
to this guy it's kind of a dumb feature

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,940
but like I want to be polite and you've

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,950
created all of this work and there's

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,620
this really big imbalance between the

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,700
amount of work created and the amounts

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,340
of effort that was actually put into

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,530
opening it so don't worry we're not

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,020
going to add a congestion tax to issues

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,330
and github

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,850
but I think that this is a very

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,130
interesting thought experiment of like

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,440
what what a congestion tax look like and

00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,910
I've already started seeing some

00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,110
open-source maintainer playing with

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,360
something that looks a bit like this

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,950
they say basically if you want me to

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,919
guarantee you that I will close the

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:12,539
issue just send me five dollars via

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:15,750
PayPal and I'm not sure if that's the

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:17,160
best solution I am I like think that we

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,960
could potentially do better than that

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,210
but I'm really excited to see people

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,980
starting to experiment with this concept

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:26,400
and I think that we could learn a lot

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,630
more from again from cities but just to

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,309
make everyone feel better that we

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,890
haven't really seen a ton of experiments

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,460
yet again most cities still don't do

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,280
this

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,809
and that's why it's so hard to commute

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,940
to work in the Bay Area so a little bit

00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:45,480
of economics here to explain what's

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,669
going on so our standard model of fixed

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,260
and marginal cost is this right you if

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,020
you're creating a factory that makes

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,659
widgets the fixed cost is the cost of

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,580
creating the factory and the marginal

00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:59,940
cost is every time you make a widget how

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,770
much more do you pay right it's useful

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,039
to break this down a little bit into

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:07,049
some subcategories so the marginal cost

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,360
includes the manufacturing cost which

00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:11,159
can be like the materials the cost of

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,169
running the machines there's the

00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,120
distribution cost which is you know you

00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,830
need to get the widgets to the people

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,240
and maybe you have trucks that are

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,809
driving them to stores all over the

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,330
place

00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:23,220
there's the servicing cost let's say the

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,039
widget I don't know bites of kids

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,669
fingers off and now like his mom calls

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,320
in and says hey my kid has a problem

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,330
that then you have to pay for all of the

00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:38,280
the call centers that now like service

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,960
that thing open-source and software

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,419
people usually think of has it having

00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,070
zero marginal cost they think it's all

00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,740
fixed costs you just do the development

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,150
upfront and then you're good to go and I

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,130
think that this is the source of a lot

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,870
of the misconceptions around funding

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,980
open source and why we think that we

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,960
don't need to fund it because you're

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,240
like well the fixed cost is there you

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,490
just make copies and yes I would

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,940
download a car if I could kind of

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:06,320
this is sort of right I think this does

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,270
point to something that is really

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,190
beautiful about software where most of

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,400
the investment does happen upfront and

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,400
then does scale immensely but it misses

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,310
something so the manufacturing cost is

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,250
basically zero copying bits is very

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,530
cheap distribution cost is basically

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,530
zero you just go to the github repo or

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:29,680
you know down the tarball or whatever

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:32,300
but the servicing cost is not free

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,480
every time someone opens a bug report

00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,370
that imposes a cost on the maintainer or

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,220
the developer the community that is

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:43,610
maintaining this work and that is not

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,590
seen for a very long time it grows

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,920
slowly enough that we think that it is

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:51,350
zero but it's actually not and so over

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,050
time it can become extremely burdensome

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,990
on the people if enough people are using

00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,370
their software and I think this is the

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,230
source of why a lot of maintainer x'

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,880
don't get the sympathy that they deserve

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,740
for the really hard work that they're

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,050
doing people think oh you just wrote the

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,940
code like it's really not that bad and

00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,340
don't you like writing code but actually

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,200
servicing costs is extremely high

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,450
not to mention dealing with the people

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,040
problems that can come about from the

00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,600
earlier problems that we talked about

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,110
around like making decisions and

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,750
deciding what the funding is so I would

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,180
really like people to stop sharing the

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,270
meme that software has zero marginal

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,580
costs because it's really not true and I

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,110
think it leads to a lot of bad behavior

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,820
down the line people people

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,620
understandably make like I do think that

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,780
it's an understandable misinterpretation

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,580
but we need to remember that there's

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,880
that servicing cost that really does

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,890
bear on people so again the way we deal

00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,020
with that cost that the marginal cost in

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,820
cities is that condemned congestion tax

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,710
I think would be really cool to start

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,930
seeing people think about how to price

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,120
that that cost that is currently

00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,350
entirely being borne by maintainer x'

00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,820
and i want to spread that around a

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,820
little bit and make it so the whole

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,260
community bears it okay

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,350
so those are three things that I think

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,150
we can learn from cities and I'm really

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,920
excited to see more people experimenting

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,170
with this over time there's been really

00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,620
an explosion of people trying things

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,570
like this

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,160
and I've incepted these ideas and enough

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,710
people that some some things have

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,370
started happening but there's something

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,930
that we have very different between

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,460
physical infrastructure and digital

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,260
infrastructure so here's the place where

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,580
I want to change gears a little bit and

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,370
say you know we're gonna have to figure

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:35,300
this one out on our own and that is when

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:37,520
to define governance so let's say I want

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,930
to build a dam if I want to build a dam

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,360
it is really hard to even get started I

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,640
have to get permits I probably have to

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,020
have a master's degree at least so

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,809
there's like there's three years of my

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,429
life I have to go through environmental

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:54,380
review I have to go talk to all the

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,870
communities I have to raise a ton of

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,700
capital the list goes on and on before

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,790
you're even starting to lay the first

00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,590
rounds of cement and so what this means

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,510
is that there's a really high barrier to

00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,850
entry for building something like a dam

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,440
or any other physical infrastructure one

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,610
of us cannot just walk out there and be

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,070
like you know what I want to build a new

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,230
highway today no that's not that's not

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,940
an option

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,370
by contrast starting a new open-source

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,590
project is really easy all you have to

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,690
do is go to github create a new

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,580
repository and there you go you have an

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,280
open-source project maybe no one's using

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,420
it and maybe it's totally useless but

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,880
you can start and there's no one's

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,980
stopping you this is one of the most

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,510
beautiful things about open-source it's

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,470
one of the reasons why we get so much

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:41,240
innovation really talented people who

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,820
maybe society doesn't necessarily

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,559
respect or like overlooks a little bit

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,360
you can just go in and be like I have

00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,160
this really cool idea I want to share it

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,929
with my friends and then oftentimes

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,600
it'll just take off from there because

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,860
what they've built is so amazing so this

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,160
is one of the best things about

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,630
open-source it is also the source of

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,210
some of the biggest challenges of

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:05,900
open-source and what I mean by that is

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:08,150
that open-source developers often start

00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,309
projects without really having a very

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,690
long term plan for what it'll be because

00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:13,640
they're just hacking away on a Friday

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,380
night they eating their pizza with their

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,490
friends or whatever maybe at a hackathon

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,530
and they don't necessarily even know

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:24,650
what it'll be in a week let alone in

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,240
three years or five years so a very very

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,010
often story that I hear from

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,750
amazing open-source maintainer x' is

00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,250
that they've started this project it was

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,960
solving problems for them their friends

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,260
and then suddenly all these people just

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,360
started joining the party and opening

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,670
poll requests and opening issues and at

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,470
first it was really exciting but then

00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,630
started getting really really

00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,400
overwhelming because people just started

00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,290
pouring in and they they're like I

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,280
really never expected any of this to

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,930
happen and the result is that it's

00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,580
really stressful because you kind of

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,170
never put the boundaries in place of

00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,060
what it is that you want your

00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,860
open-source project to be you've never

00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,080
really defined what is and is not the

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,750
community who does get to decide rules

00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,150
who doesn't if you start receiving

00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:10,940
funding who gets to make who gets the

00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,590
money I can't tell you how many

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,450
open-source projects I know of who are

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,830
raising money but as soon as they have

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,110
the money it just sits in the bank

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,390
account because they're like who do we

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,770
actually allocate this to this is really

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,150
hard now we didn't really think about

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,770
this yet

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:30,320
and so this is one place where I think

00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:32,870
we can provide a lot better education

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,900
and setting those norms and also making

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:38,780
it easier to learn from other people and

00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:42,680
so because a lot of open-source work is

00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:45,050
effectively all remote work people don't

00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,060
necessarily have really strong mentors

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,340
that they can learn from people who can

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,200
tell them you know this is the way I did

00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,150
it this is how we solve our problems and

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,710
so one of the things I've been trying to

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,270
do during my time here at github is

00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,580
create more spaces for open-source

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,070
developers to talk to each other and to

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,450
learn from each other because people

00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,160
have really figured out a lot of really

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,680
cool things and it's just a question of

00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,050
sharing those and I think it's also

00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,100
important to point this out that when

00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,870
you get to the point where you're

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,210
feeling overwhelmed with an open-source

00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:17,180
project you should just start to think

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,650
about okay what what structure should I

00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,730
be putting in place now that it's big

00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,620
and I think it's cool because it means

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,630
that we get to lazy load governance it

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,520
means that with a dam you have to decide

00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,070
governance and make all these decisions

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,990
up front now we only get to decide if

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:31,250
the project's actually working but the

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,960
thing is when the project is actually

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,790
working you do need to decide these

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,480
questions you do need to nail these down

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,370
because otherwise you will be completely

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,070
overwhelmed

00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:45,820
with work and with really hard ethical

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,740
questions even okay so that was sort of

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:51,220
a whirlwind through my two obsessions

00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:54,100
which are cities and open-source and I

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,950
would love to talk about these basically

00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,440
without any end whatsoever but I also

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,720
want to leave you guys some time to ask

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,130
questions about github sponsors about

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,350
how github thinks about open source

00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,780
about any of the research that I've done

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,870
or about cities to if if you are

00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,929
interested so I will leave you with just

00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,370
one story that I think will I find

00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:19,470
really helpful but you might find kind

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:22,780
of gross in Japan as late as I think the

00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,610
1950s they didn't have sewage in most

00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,800
major cities so if you've ever been to

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,800
Tokyo I mean imagine Tokyo with no

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,780
sewage system not a pretty sight

00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,059
if you look at those those barrels

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:37,690
they're sitting on the sidewalk you can

00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:39,490
guess what those are filled with and if

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,370
you go to Tokyo today it is a sparkling

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:45,250
clean city it smells great it doesn't

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,530
smell bad at least and they've really

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,240
solved this problem and so while I think

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,760
every once in a while I get a little

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,500
down about how little we are funding

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,860
open source and how little support

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,600
maintainer 'z have but we are not in

00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,340
this bad of a situation we are not

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,600
literally you know I'm actually not

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:06,190
going to go there but the point is we

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,230
can make progress really quickly it only

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,179
took about a decade or two for them to

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,400
fully replace all of this infrastructure

00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,710
and solve these problems and they did it

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,809
and not a very bump on Houseman style

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,130
they did it without disrupting a ton of

00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,170
people's lives because they had better

00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,890
technology and they were more thoughtful

00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:25,179
so I like this picture because it

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,610
reminds me that we can make progress

00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:29,440
quickly we can do a lot even when it

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,710
seems like a very desperate situation

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,510
and so I'm really excited to see more

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,250
experiments encourage more experiments

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:38,380
and and try new things out inside of the

00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,140
github product too so if you guys have

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,940
any ideas please let me know I think oh

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,210
this is this is their new sewage system

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:49,630
it works a lot better if you have any

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,040
ideas whatsoever please email me at the

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,389
email that is really small on the screen

00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,690
right now

00:28:52,389 --> 00:29:05,979
or send me a DM on Twitter or just reach

00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:07,869
out to me on github so thanks so looking

00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:10,840
at the timer that I'm left here I have

00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:13,169
about ten minutes for Q&A if you have

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:20,019
any questions whatsoever let let me know

00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:23,469
and I think we have microphones yes Hey

00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:25,659
so this is on the city side of things

00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:30,599
have you heard of opportunity zones and

00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:32,979
and you ever take on them um yeah so I

00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,039
read about them a while ago and I had to

00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:37,779
take I need to just remember what it was

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,039
that would probably be better I take a

00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:41,200
lot of notes so it's written down

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,450
somewhere in my external brain but it's

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,450
not in my real brain yeah

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:57,300
hi Devin how did your interest in cities

00:29:53,310 --> 00:30:03,270
inspire the mechanics of sponsors yeah

00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:04,530
so it really is what got me into it all

00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,800
in the first place and actually how I

00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:09,300
met NAT the the CEO of github I'm very

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,200
involved in housing policy in San

00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:14,430
Francisco and he is too and so we didn't

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,810
even talk about software for the first

00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,820
like year that we knew each other I

00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,590
didn't really know that he had any

00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,030
technical background we were just

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,010
talking about cities and like yelling

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:27,210
about city planning meetings and things

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:30,810
like that and it really inspired the

00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:32,280
whole project actually so I this is a

00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:35,730
little bit abstract but I think it's

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,800
it's useful still I'm a really big

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,030
believer that coordination problems are

00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,310
some of the biggest problems in the

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,530
world and a coordination problem is if

00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:45,570
you guys are familiar with prisoners

00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:48,480
dilemmas or tragedies of the Commons

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:51,600
this idea of you know two people or

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,250
multiple people who when they act in

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,990
their own best self-interest they do

00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,490
things that are worse for all of them I

00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,500
think those are some of the worst

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,290
problems in the world a prime example of

00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,120
this being global warming right where

00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:05,100
everyone doesn't want the planet to melt

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,400
I think we're all on the same page with

00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,600
that but at the same time every time you

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,820
get in the shower you just want to leave

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,950
it on a little bit longer or you know

00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,990
you want to buy that new thing that like

00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,430
comes in a big plastic wrap or you know

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,960
it's a little bit more efficient to take

00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,320
an uber than to bike so I'm gonna do

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,120
that

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,140
but if we all do that then it adds up

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,760
and it screws us all so I think the way

00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,200
that we are not really funding

00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,840
open-source at the moment is the same

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,790
kind of problem where we would all be

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,550
better off if our digital infrastructure

00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,350
was great and we could all use it

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:39,990
without a hitch and it was well

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,280
maintained over the long term but no one

00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:45,510
really wants to be the person who

00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,010
actually foots the bill and so I was

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:49,200
originally spending a lot of my time

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,660
thinking about these problems in the

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,610
city context but frankly I felt a little

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,590
bit powerless because I was just a

00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,200
software engineer who had a lot of

00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,780
opinions but like no real knowledge

00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,390
about how city governments worked and I

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:07,700
felt like I wasn't making very much prod

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:09,720
and once I sort of made once Nadia's

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,980
report about roads and bridges sort of

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,390
connected the dots for me making me

00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,060
realize oh we're seeing the same

00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,950
problems an open source I thought I can

00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,840
make a much bigger impact there like I

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,790
as a software engineer myself I

00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,340
understand how this stuff works I know

00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:26,580
the people involved I can do things here

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,950
and then when not became the CEO I sent

00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,420
him a very long email being like you

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:34,290
guys should do something about open

00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:35,460
source and then the he emailed me back

00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,890
saying you should do something about

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,650
open source come try and github so

00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,360
there's there's a very very strong

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:47,430
thread between those and in my brain I

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,960
cannot separate them at all you

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,260
mentioned briefly talk about

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,750
sponsorships and I know that github

00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,420
offers encourages open source projects

00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:59,430
to get sponsorships what's the minimum

00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,500
entry requirement in other words do you

00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:05,550
have to be registered as a non-profit to

00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:08,220
be supported that way or just an

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:10,470
individual developer or what the minimum

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:15,710
requirement is to have a github account

00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:18,030
and to not be abusive on the platform we

00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,190
get it as a really strong product

00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:23,070
philosophy of creating a canvas for

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,750
developers to do things on and we don't

00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,040
really want to define what people do as

00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:30,240
long as it's within the bounds of our

00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:32,910
respectful community and so we don't

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,380
want to pick winners and we we invite

00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,560
everyone to get sponsored through

00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:40,620
through getting sponsors I mean I can

00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,360
say like if we were picking winners we

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,220
would not have chosen certain projects

00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,440
that we just didn't know about so it's

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:51,600
really important for us to leave it as

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:53,160
open as possible to everybody hey I'm a

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,650
big fan of yours I think that this is a

00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,930
fantastic talk and I'm super grateful

00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,120
for the sponsors project I'd like to

00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:03,330
know what you think as far as the role

00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,980
that github has in in the funding and

00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,900
sustainability of open source like to

00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,270
what extent do they feel it's a

00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,880
responsibility and an obligation versus

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:14,270
just something that we should

00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:19,490
a responsibility and obligation on the

00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:22,460
part of github or so get it would be

00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:24,710
nothing without open source developers

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,350
are the core of the github community and

00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,060
it's why people come to github I think

00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,760
actually an interesting and interesting

00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:34,580
metaphor here is like twitch or YouTube

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,320
so twitch and YouTube have a very small

00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:39,080
portion of the user bases that are

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,540
streamers or you know video creators but

00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,130
if they didn't upload content like no

00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,470
one would want to come to that community

00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,600
at all I think that's where the

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:50,750
parallels end there's other things that

00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,330
are not similar but I think once you

00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,070
frame it as that where it's like

00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:58,310
maintained errs are what make github

00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:00,410
what it is then it's pretty it's just

00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,570
obvious good business sense forget him

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,420
to be doing this so that's one thing I

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,620
think like it's it's just out of like

00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,230
almost economic self-interest it's a

00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,480
great idea to do this and I think it was

00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,820
I'm very excited for github to be taking

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,620
this on for that reason and it's also

00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,390
one of the reasons why I thought github

00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:20,660
was a good place because it's not just a

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:23,270
question of sort of charity or just out

00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,830
of self out of being like good good

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,840
company but it's actually something that

00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:28,250
is sustained for the long term because

00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,370
it's really necessary for the long-term

00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:34,130
health of the whole ecosystem on the

00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,050
other hand I'm doing this because I

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,290
think that github also has sort of an

00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:41,930
obligation github again would be nothing

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,080
and so it's very important to give back

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:48,470
to that community because they've done

00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:51,170
so much for for github and for all of

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:53,180
the companies that use software that I

00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,770
think it's a big thing but that said I

00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,510
don't think it hubs the only one that

00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,550
has the obligation I think every company

00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,170
that uses open-source has an obligation

00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:03,260
here every developer who uses

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,820
open-source and so I'm I think we're

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,440
starting to see a cultural change where

00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,930
people are starting to recognize this

00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,440
but it's it's it's been happening kind

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,630
of slowly over the last few years so yes

00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,229
to both

00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:19,699
hi hi as you extend the digital

00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,959
infrastructure metaphor and kind of

00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:22,369
looking at city infrastructure the way

00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:24,140
that you were looking at it there's

00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:26,509
there's a border in there somewhere

00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,829
where it stops being city infrastructure

00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:30,559
and starts being the plumbing in your

00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:32,809
house and when we look at the way

00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,630
companies tend to fund open source

00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:37,189
projects that line is very blurry and I

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,719
and I wanted to hear kind of how you

00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:39,349
think about that particular aspect of

00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,089
the problem

00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:42,320
that's an interesting extension of

00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:45,419
metaphor

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,419
[Music]

00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,829
I think

00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:00,750
this is one of the places where I think

00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,550
it creates a lot of the tension that we

00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,500
start seeing in issues we've probably

00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:08,130
all seen those flame war issue threads

00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,810
that happen and I think one of the

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,230
sources of tension here is that

00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,670
companies understandably once open

00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,180
source to be as useful as possible to

00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:21,450
them but the maintainer say he dude this

00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,340
is my road map and also I'm not gonna

00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:25,740
just go do some boring integration work

00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,720
for you for free that's not going to

00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,720
happen and so there's this mismatch of

00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,250
expectations because companies think oh

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,570
wait why doesn't the maintainer want

00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,580
this to be as useful to everyone as

00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,110
possible and the maintainer thinks why

00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,530
does this company feel entitled to my

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:43,590
time both very understandable reactions

00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:46,320
and so one of the things that I think

00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,180
can smooth that over is if the company

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,970
says hey we will pay you to do this we

00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,680
are excited to use the software we just

00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,780
need it to be tweaks in this way we need

00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,940
you know a wrapper around it to make it

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,040
more useful here's some cash to make

00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,960
that happen and so that can align the

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,730
incentives where you know the the

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,410
maintainer is saying okay you know I'm

00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,420
happy to do some of this custom work

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,130
it's not really what I'm personally most

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,200
excited to do and the core of the

00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,700
project but it's a way to make it a

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,470
little bit more useful to more people

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,540
maybe it'll also be useful to the rest

00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,950
of the community some people will you

00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,619
know have to have this particular

00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:23,340
integration - I'll make that happen so I

00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:25,740
think money can sort of make that

00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:28,470
simpler I do want to note that it can be

00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,600
it can also create risks where it could

00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:33,030
potentially sort of change the road map

00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,650
and it's not just about changing just a

00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,750
wrapper but maybe it changes some part

00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:37,619
of the core library and I think that's

00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,560
something that we have to be very

00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,090
careful of so this is one of the reasons

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,390
we've been rolling out github sponsors

00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,980
very slowly is because while I believe

00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,080
very strongly that we should be funding

00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,350
open source we cannot make this change

00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,359
it's too quickly because like we learned

00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:57,240
in Paris it ruins people's lives no I

00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,859
mean the if you if you completely change

00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,109
the paradigm of the way something is

00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,580
done it can create a lot of problems

00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:05,160
even if the old paradigm was kind of

00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,200
broken so that's one of the things I'm

00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,000
keeping an eye out for is making sure

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,580
that

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,900
it is actually a question of doing just

00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,840
some custom work on the edge of the

00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,970
project that helps the company without

00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,770
sort of screwing up the entire project

00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,050
and I try to have a call with a

00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:23,090
maintainer every single day who's in the

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,950
program just to make sure that that

00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:31,220
isn't happening and sort of keeping

00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:34,300
keeping an eye on things okay

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,740
I oh I think we have one more question

00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:40,000
and we have one more minute according to

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,000
my clock and then we can wrap up

00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:54,960
hey thanks so you mentioned in the talk

00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:57,330
about governance and definitely when you

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,380
get the money coming into a project you

00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,430
have the governance question how to

00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,210
spend it yeah

00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:05,460
does does github have plans to provide

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,170
support or training or materials to help

00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,640
new projects or projects that are

00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:13,670
growing adopt best practices or help

00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,770
them find the model that works for them

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:20,850
that's a good question so right now the

00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:23,100
answer is just me I it's not really a

00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:24,900
formal thing but anytime I maintainer

00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,580
wants to talk about that stuff I am more

00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,240
than happy to talk about it and give

00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,040
input and I'm I really have a cool job

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,780
because I get to talk to all of these

00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,910
different people and sort of share the

00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,800
best practices across them so while I

00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,060
don't think I have I don't personally

00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,980
have all the answers that I've created

00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,170
myself I've like collected a lot of

00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,760
really good answers from other people

00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,170
that's not scalable though unfortunately

00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,570
I don't have a cloning machine

00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:50,370
not yet someone hopefully builds an

00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:54,000
open-source version of that at some

00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:56,460
point soon but I think that's something

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,410
that we could do better at I also think

00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,320
that best practices are not very well

00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:04,470
defined right now often my advice comes

00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,480
in the form of here's a menu and this is

00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,130
what I think the consequences are of

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,510
different options but I don't really

00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,280
know here you go

00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,500
but as we're learning more through this

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,380
program and as we as we sort of collect

00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,470
a set of options I think best practices

00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:22,170
will continue to sort of rise to the top

00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:24,510
and I'm excited to see that happen so

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,130
long story short we don't have anything

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,140
like that right now I think it's

00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,090
something we can and should build in the

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,970
future but I want to hold off until we

00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:35,850
have better answers because the what's

00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,060
worse than no advice is bad advice so we

00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:41,280
want to we want to be careful there

00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,980
great thank you all I'll be hanging

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,850
around here

00:41:41,980 --> 00:42:13,250
