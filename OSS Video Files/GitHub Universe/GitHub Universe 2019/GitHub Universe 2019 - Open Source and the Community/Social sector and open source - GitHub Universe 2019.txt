Title: Social sector and open source - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-12-13
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Open Source and the Community
Description: 
	Presented by:
Gina Assaf, Digital Design and Research Consultant for Social and Global Impact & Good
Mala Kumar, Program Manager, Open Source for Good at GitHub
John Jones, Vice President of Interactive Strategies at The Case Foundation

The open source ecosystem, which includes software products, data and methodologies, is a driving force behind many breakthrough achievements in digital technology within the private sector. However, for nonprofits, international aid organizations and others in the social sector, open source adoption remains weak despite its massive potential to improve how the industry functions. In this session you’ll hear about GitHub’s new Open Source for Good program, the specific challenges in OS adoption by social sector, examples of nonprofits that are successfully implementing large scale OS projects and how GitHub can better support OS adoption by the social sector in the future.

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,660
everyone can hear me okay yeah all right

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,630
thanks so much for coming to our talk on

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,970
social sector and open source my name is

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,180
mala and I'm a program manager here at

00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,820
github I work under admin on the social

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,850
impact team and I lead a program called

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,220
open source for good the broad remit of

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,379
open source for good is how can we

00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,790
ensure the open source ecosystem betters

00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:49,690
the world so you know kind of a small

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,940
goal but it's fun well in that lofty

00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,530
moonshot goal obviously we have a lot of

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,230
ways that we can approach the question

00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,559
and I joined github in April of this

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,010
year

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,440
so April 2019 and prior to joining

00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,790
github I spent about a decade working at

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,880
the United Nations and other

00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,110
international development organizations

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,300
designing and building core digital

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,890
products for different stakeholders so

00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,080
it was my job to go to different

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,970
countries to understand their needs and

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,610
to build whichever product that they

00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,890
needed obviously a github we have a

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,510
different approach to technology so

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,310
while we don't it's not our job to go

00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,590
out and build the individual tools that

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,909
comprise the open source ecosystem we

00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,920
built the software that hosts the

00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,439
majority of the open source ecosystem

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,000
and so when we think about this question

00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,820
how can we ensure the open source

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,369
ecosystem betters the world our approach

00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,500
is really morphed into this question how

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:43,570
can we help social sector organisations

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,430
engage with open source to better the

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,290
world so that means how can we look at

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,049
the organizations that do the core work

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,299
the core social justice work to advance

00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:55,930
and promote social justice causes and

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,580
help them use open source to better what

00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,890
they do and that could be anything from

00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,220
building better programs it could be you

00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,869
know increasing operational efficiency

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,869
ignore that thank you

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,350
or it could be to build internal

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,610
technical capacity so we're really

00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,709
working with the social sector

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,430
organisations in order so they can work

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:20,799
better now on the social impact team

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,450
we're a mighty team of three but between

00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,160
the three of us among the three of us we

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,049
have many decades of experience of

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,910
social sector work whether it's a huge

00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:29,780
multinational organization like the UN

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,490
or smaller domestic non

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,740
it's really rerun the entire gamut and

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,840
more than that we have a lot of capacity

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,220
we have a great Network and so if we

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,350
have a knowledge gap in the social

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,000
sector we know who to call we know who

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,890
to ask and we know how to fill those

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,530
gaps so it's safe to say that we know a

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,270
lot about the social sector and then on

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,830
the other front github we know about

00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,300
open source it's kind of our thing I

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,850
don't know if you notice that theme but

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,100
we know about open source but what we

00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,840
know less about is this intersection how

00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,000
does the social sector actually interact

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,709
with open source what can we actually do

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,290
to improve that ecosystem that

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,720
intersection they're in now instead of

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,850
taking some kind of one-off guesses and

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,430
just supposing that we know the answer

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,350
to that as social scientists we decided

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,590
to take a more systematic approach and

00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,300
so when we think about mission when we

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,739
think about what that interaction could

00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,810
look like there's a lot of different

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,730
ways that it could play out we could

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,620
look at the mission or the vision or we

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,750
could look at the thematic the mandated

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,430
area of the organization we could look

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,410
at the geography where does the

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,880
organization actually based do they have

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,860
a headquarters in one country do they

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,840
work abroad and others do they have

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,880
federated organizations across one

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,010
country are they concentrated on one

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,870
local area there's a lot of different

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,880
geographies that play what about

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,860
language the majority of the open source

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,110
ecosystem is hosted in English

00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,310
documentation is mostly in English so

00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,829
what happens if we're working in

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,250
francophone West Africa or in Spanish or

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,690
Portuguese speaking Latin America we

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,250
could also look at the organizational

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,290
structure there's many different

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,519
structures and in a minute you'll hear

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,170
more about that many different

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,810
organizational structures that comprise

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,160
the social sector there's tax statuses

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,750
like nonprofit and then there's

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,130
organizations that are for-profit that

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,440
do really wonderful work but they don't

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,760
have that tax status organizations that

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,980
have boarded of advisers and

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,859
organizations that have one person or

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,690
10,000 people and then another theme

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,360
you'll hear about a lot today is funding

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,760
models do these organizations get their

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,160
money from US governments through USAID

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,440
or diff it do they get money from

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,669
individual donors contributing or do

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,650
they get money from grants from

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,830
foundations

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,630
so again looking at that many

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,430
complicated set of questions instead of

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,199
just making guesses of what we think

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,900
that intersection would look like we

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,910
decided to take a systematic approach by

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,210
doing a research project we love

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,490
research so our research project is

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,650
asking one critical question which is

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,280
how or what are the challenges and

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,540
opportunities of the social sector in

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,520
engaging with open source either as

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,070
producers or consumers or just really

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,110
fun bystanders one of the important

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,789
questions therein that's pertinent to

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,710
this audience what are the challenges

00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:10,930
and opportunities that the social sector

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,970
has in producing open source software

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,830
and so to take you through some of those

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,510
insights you know where we've got a lot

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,940
of data and we've done a ton of evidence

00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,470
gathering both qualitative and

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,729
quantitative but to take you through

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,250
some of the insights that we do have

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:27,130
before we do the final synthesis it's my

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,539
pleasure to introduce you Gina Asaf who

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:36,669
is an independent consultant and

00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:38,950
researcher for the social sector hello

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,900
can you hear me good thank you mala for

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,340
the introduction I just want to you know

00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,930
you all know that I have a little bit of

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,000
a cough so if I go into a coughing fit

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,070
excuse me I did take some cough

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,289
suppressant so I should be good

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,990
I'm Gina Asaf and I'm a technology

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:55,180
designer and researcher with a software

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,830
development background I worked in the

00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,110
private tech sector for several years

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,669
but more recently for the past four to

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,430
five years I've been a technology

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:06,970
designer for the global development and

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,830
international aid space and I was

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,110
brought on by the case foundation and

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,570
github to help lead this research

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,130
project which mala you know talk to you

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,690
little bit about which is we're trying

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,660
to understand what are the barriers the

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,030
challenges the successes in open source

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,400
in the social sector and I'm happy to

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,690
share today a little bit about what

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,419
we've been working on the past few

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,800
months on in this research it's the next

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,800
slide oh do we have a clicker

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,990
so our approach to this project is

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,060
rooted in the human centered user

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,860
centered design approach which means

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,960
we're putting the users the stakeholders

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,330
center and we're trying to understand

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,350
their engagement with technology in the

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:53,080
social sector and so we bucketed the

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:56,260
users into three or four types of users

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,510
we have producers so developers of

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,350
software and you can be any part of the

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:05,590
development process a developer product

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,060
manager a designer or a consumer of

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,070
software so you're you know you use

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,110
software you use it for your purposes

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,960
for your social sector or a funder of

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,390
technology and of course there's overlap

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,650
between these roles if you're a producer

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,900
of technology and open source software

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,090
you're most likely going to be a

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,700
consumer of technology an open source

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,070
software but we try to bucket and target

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,110
the users in our research based on where

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,390
we saw more potential to engage further

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,950
with open source software and then we

00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:35,200
looked at different levels of engagement

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,300
when we were targeting individuals so

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,900
high engagement with open source

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,280
software to low or non-existent

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,650
engagement with open source software and

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,360
to understand these users their

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:49,450
motivations their challenges and their

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,220
successes we conducted a combination of

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,650
quantitative analysis with a widely

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,990
disseminated survey and then we also did

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,670
qualitative research with semi

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,410
structured interviews and we've

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,410
conducted about 30 interviews so far

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,610
and as we're mapping is we're doing a

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,040
scoping on this space we noted

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,770
individuals and organizations working in

00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,810
the social sector space looking you know

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,790
working domestically and globally and we

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,040
noted differences between organizations

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,449
that are implementers of project versus

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,610
funders and of course there's

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:27,419
organizations that do both they

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,889
implement projects and they fund project

00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,780
and as you can imagine this space is

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,810
huge and there's a lot of actors in this

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,610
face and we focus on areas that we

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,490
thought would give us a diverse set of

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,770
inputs and also would align with the

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,520
priorities of the case foundation and

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,990
github and so you know we targeted

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,460
individuals from these different

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,040
organizations and the ones that we have

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,770
here are the ones that we focused on so

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,910
we talked to NGOs and nonprofits

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,779
domestically and internationally such as

00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,910
YMCA

00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,850
and internationally like Mercy Corps and

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,320
then looked at foundations such as the

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,100
Gates Foundation and the Ford Foundation

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,140
and then we also talked to multinational

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,670
organizations such as the UN in the

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,020
World Bank and then we also talked to

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,390
tech consultants and these are

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,730
individuals who are either working

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,020
internally within the organizations or

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,910
they're independently and they work

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,830
across multiple organizations within the

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,170
social sector and we targeted these

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,630
individuals from the producer and the

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:33,390
funder and the developer side in our

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:35,160
research and as we also were mapping out

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,950
the roles within these social sector

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,450
organizations we try to understand you

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,430
know where you are when it comes to

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,800
decision making power and your

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,180
understanding of Technology and open

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,550
source software and we noted an

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,390
imbalance here so we have people making

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:53,880
decisions on technology and on you know

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,680
potentially using open-source but their

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,020
knowledge of you know they have high

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
high power and decision-making process

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,800
but their knowledge of Technology more

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,779
broadly and then open source software

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,750
board specifically it was very you know

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,850
is very limited and so for example you

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,709
have program implementers those are

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,990
their experts in their field of the

00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,550
social sector programming such as youth

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,370
you know they're looking at youth issues

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,010
or agriculture or

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,300
or education or like their executives

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,500
running these nonprofits but then

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:25,040
they're limited in their knowledge of

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,660
technology um and so you know other than

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,670
this insight that we kind of like glean

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,490
when we were like scoping out the roles

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,430
and the organizations in this sector

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,380
from our research we we want to you know

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,529
we're still in the process as mala

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,900
mention of analyzing our our notes and

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:43,790
and doing full synthesis we wanted to

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,310
share a few early insights from our

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,230
research and we focus on the production

00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,420
side of open source software here what

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,900
we're sharing with you all and you know

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,490
but we'll have a full report early 2020

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,900
with all the findings and the research

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,410
and I want to emphasize this is early

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:03,950
insights that we have from this research

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,839
the first insight that we noted was you

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,940
know in these organizations when they're

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,110
looking at technology and and they're

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,029
assessing their needs they're gonna

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,290
bring in sometimes these consultants

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,779
that are working internally or

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,310
externally and they're gonna assess

00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,200
what's out there what's available if

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,910
there's nothing out there that meets

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,880
their needs exactly this is when they

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,770
look at custom-built software and and

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,800
the cases when they are gonna build

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,450
custom build software into scale what's

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,920
important to these organizations is to

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,470
do it in a sustainable and affordable

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,990
way and we found some successful

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,600
examples where open-source was a very

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,770
viable solution and the success

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,770
domestically and globally

00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:49,040
second insight was that there are open

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,930
source projects that are developed by

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,670
the social sector and there are some

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,580
successful ones however the majority of

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,080
them and this is an issue is that the

00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,880
social sector organization and

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,180
developers individuals working in this

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,070
sector will download fork the code use

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,450
it for their own individual use case

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:09,770
update it but then they will not

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,260
contribute it back to the main source

00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,570
code to benefit the wider sector and we

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,760
see this as a missed opportunity in

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,220
cross organizational collaboration in

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,840
technology that could benefit you know

00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:26,540
very important social sector use cases

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,790
the third insight that we want to share

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,920
was more on the challenge side so there

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,560
are some individuals and organizations

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,870
that are believers in the open source

00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,820
movement and they've built open source

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,890
projects and they even have developers

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,910
that are interested in contributing

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,720
however the challenge that they're

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:46,400
facing is in managing these developers

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,890
these organizations are strapped for

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,990
money and time and budget and so

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,870
bringing on developers training them on

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,670
the codebase and and and managing the

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,950
community of developers is just beyond

00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,050
their what they have available in terms

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,300
of times and resource and you know they

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,580
even though they saw the clear value in

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,770
the open source and they had developers

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,260
readily available they were not able to

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,970
leverage on and so these are a few of

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,530
our early insights we you know we're

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,300
gonna have a lot more a lot of findings

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,180
and more research that we're gonna share

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,160
in our report early 2020 so stay tuned

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,510
for that and I'm gonna hand it back to

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,440
mala who's going to share some examples

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:26,980
related to these insights thank you yeah

00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,980
good job

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,660
thank you so much Tina for those really

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,430
wonderful insights you know it's one of

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,810
the really wonderful things about doing

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,460
this research is that we've had the

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,740
opportunity to connect with so many

00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,900
inspiring organizations working at this

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,590
intersection of social sector and open

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,820
source and when I think about a

00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,530
organization or even a person that's

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,300
really used open source to catalyze

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,640
change from within the organization to

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,160
really kind of hone in on the approach

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,220
that we're hoping to take it's Andrew

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,600
Pham who is the co the co-founder and

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,690
head of product at HEC aya

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,690
you saw her kaya's logo earlier in the

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,000
announcement of github sponsors so as

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,170
Gina mentioned a lot of times tech

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,210
consultants will be brought into

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,670
different social sector organizations to

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,430
do a long consultation process and I do

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,560
mean long in the social sector every

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,180
budget has to be every dollar of every

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,980
budget really has to be accounted for

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,630
and so you're not allowed to just buy

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,180
licenses or procure things without

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,950
really justifying those costs so as a

00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,570
result these consultants come in they

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,920
have to do a long vetting process and

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,420
really come up with the reasoning as to

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,150
why they want to go with this tool

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:39,810
versus that tool and Andrew was exactly

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:41,850
one of those consultants in 2013 he was

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,920
deployed to at the Afghanistan country

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,440
office of a major international global

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,240
humanitarian organization and he spent

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,100
one year going through every single

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,640
indicator tracking software on earth

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,320
really after that full year they found

00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,600
one tool that kind of worked they

00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,670
piloted it and it turned out it didn't

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,260
actually work it didn't really meet the

00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,730
needs of their use cases that didn't

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,850
have the access and the permissions that

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:07,230
they needed but thankfully Andrew and a

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,520
few of his colleagues decided in

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,500
parallel that they were going to try to

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,410
build their own solution using github

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,850
and open source within four to six

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,890
months so remember the consultation

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,050
process took a full year but within six

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,910
months they had piloted a full coated

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,940
prototype of their tool which they

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:26,400
called Tola activity and within a few

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,760
years they'd been able to scale Toula to

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,110
40 different countries Andrew

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,540
unfortunately could not be here today

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,550
he's uh otherwise engaged on a work

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,740
retreat in Mombasa Kenya but he sends

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,690
this picture of pianist

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,490
so they're hanging out of the beach and

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,490
Andrew if you're if you're there hi

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,270
one of the things that Andrew and I

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,070
spoke about a lot is the idea that in

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,230
the social sector we have communities of

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,660
best practices for everything everything

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,550
we have communities of best practices

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,060
for understanding the local context and

00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,080
building cultural competencies we have

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,540
frameworks and best practices for

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,910
designing projects designing indicators

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,730
and even as of late collecting and

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,980
storing data but somehow even though the

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,380
methodologies are known we don't

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,000
necessarily use best practices when it

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,600
comes to software development so

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,300
collaborative interative design and it's

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,160
it's understandable the way because of

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,100
hunting works why that actually happens

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,110
often money will be allocated at an HQ

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,600
which usually is in a major city in the

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,820
United States or in Canada or in Europe

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,040
it'll then trickle down to a regional

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,930
bureau perhaps the East Africa regional

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,720
Bureau or the South Asia regional Bureau

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,610
or it'll go through a sectoral budget so

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,430
if you work in the public health team or

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,839
the education team or the nutrition team

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,370
then it'll go to the country office and

00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,200
then finally it'll go down to the

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,970
project level and so there's very little

00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,459
collaboration among the projects at the

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,290
lowest level and every budget has to be

00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,100
allocated individually so you don't have

00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:00,170
that collaborative process at all and

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,750
what Andrew was able to do using Tola

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,760
activity and open source and github was

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,130
to reverse an entire cycle on its head

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,360
they took project level data and they

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,309
were a little feed it up into the

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,959
country level at the Afghanistan country

00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:15,079
office and then laterally scale that

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,760
across 40 different countries as Andrew

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,740
said building an open source solution

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,420
offered a level of transparency our

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,449
leadership didn't know existed

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,069
we went from managing with Gantt charts

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,199
to seeing individual bugs for each

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,360
country and for those of you who have

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,830
ever worked internationally I think you

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,720
can understand this transformative

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,640
effect imagine getting one or two

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,410
country reports every year cuz some

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,820
high-level insults but insights which

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,860
you have no idea relieve what's going on

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,360
in the field and then going from that

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,490
situation to where you can go and

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,960
troubleshoot bugs on a daily basis

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,059
you can go and tap it into the

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,440
Afghanistan country office or the canyon

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,660
country office and then see

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,900
these are the agricultural outputs from

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,130
one project that we had helping farmers

00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,860
imagine me being able to collaborate or

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,750
and analyze that over time or within the

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,670
country or within the region or among

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,440
different countries it doesn't just

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,030
change the way you build software it

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,740
changes the way that you program you

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,390
design things it changes the way that

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,430
you talk about your work and you look at

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:14,120
how to do your work in the future it's

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,070
huge of course Andrews had many

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,570
wonderful amazing successes with

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,340
open-source but of course we still have

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,020
a long way to go and so I asked him

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,780
what's one wish you have for open-source

00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:26,060
in the social sector and speaking to the

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,470
insight that Gena shared earlier it's

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,840
simply that the social sector doesn't

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,850
merge back their code there even though

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,990
it is a fairly niche industry within

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,260
open-source

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:39,230
there is a kind of a culture if you will

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,580
that we fork the code coded up for our

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,560
one case study and then we never

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,730
contribute anything back and part of it

00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,160
is because we don't have the education

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,470
tools for the social sector to have

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,030
really good in-depth conversations about

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:51,950
when you fork or when you put it onto a

00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,870
different branch the merits of actually

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,700
contributing back and part of it is

00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,740
because we have sustainability issues in

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,680
the social sector when it comes to open

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,120
source and so his wish for the social

00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,340
sector and open source is really to

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,320
create that interconnected community

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,670
that collaborative approach and for us

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,740
to think more critically about how we

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:14,030
can contribute back to what we actually

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,590
build you know one of the things that I

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,840
can say from my own experience working

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,130
at the UN and in the social sector for a

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,410
long time it's just the gratification

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,760
that you get for working on some of the

00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,860
world's most challenging problems

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,840
whether you're helping victims of a

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,210
natural disaster or you're bettering a

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,250
public health system or you're helping

00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:35,240
with gender inequality and reducing

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,770
gender and domestic violence when I

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,780
think about that intersection of just

00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,400
using open-source to really better the

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,070
world one of the people that always

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,230
comes to my mind is Hara Hussain who is

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:49,850
the founder of an organization called

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:51,560
chain Hara hails from Pakistan she

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,150
unfortunately like Andrew could not be

00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,680
with us today but she also sends a warm

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,080
hello from her home in London

00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,830
Hera about seven years ago found herself

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,200
in a very complicated situation as she

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,970
told me she unfortunately found herself

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,610
having to help two friends escape

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,740
abusive relationships and in that

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,510
process she was just shocked at how

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,460
little accurate information there was

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,970
online to help women in similar

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,590
situations Hera was a huge open source

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,150
advocate in other realms of her life

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,040
through school and through work through

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,350
volunteer efforts and so when she

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,120
decided to build a solution she knew

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,930
that the solution had to start with open

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,610
source one of the things that here and I

00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,560
spoke about a lot is her efforts in

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,120
building a community we've seen it

00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,740
through the research I think unto ative

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,320
lee we all know it at some level and

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,120
Hera confirmed that you know an open

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,950
source generally a lot of the projects

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,050
the genesis of the project is around a

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,670
common technique and so you find the

00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,890
community through the forums that care

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,270
about that technique it makes sense and

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,670
it also makes building a community

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,470
relatively straightforward go to the

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,990
forums where those technologies exist

00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,730
come to github universe and find them be

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,460
passionate about that tech challenge and

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,170
start a project through that but in the

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,420
open and open source for the social

00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:08,010
sector more often than not the open

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,110
source community is built around as

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:12,330
common social cause and so the people

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,830
who really care about that cause they

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,020
may not be at universe they may not be

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,280
in these conferences and so how you mark

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,230
it and build that community is not

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,340
nearly as straightforward you have to go

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,840
to where those people who care about

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,490
that cause is even if they're not

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,110
open-source advocates even if they don't

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,430
know about open source they might

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,710
eventually contribute back to your

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,540
project and that's exactly what Hera did

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,640
she's she's great she's spoken all over

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,460
the world about chains work and it

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,800
worked in six years she's built a

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,280
community of over 400 developers the

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,700
majority of whom themselves are victims

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,570
of abusive relationships and our

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,160
representative of intersectional

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,570
communities so intersectional

00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,440
communities designing for other

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:54,180
intersectional communities since six

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,520
years ago when the website launched her

00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:59,310
guides and chance guides have been

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,040
viewed by 360,000 unique visitors and

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,480
they're available in eight languages not

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,910
only are they available in those eight

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,149
languages they're context-specific so if

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,919
I go online and I tried

00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:10,629
find a guide in Italian or an O to do

00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,580
then I'm not only finding a guide

00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,109
written in the language I'm finding

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,809
something that's written for Italian law

00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:18,879
or Pakistani law

00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:22,149
she's got guides on all kinds of

00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:24,399
different aspects of abuse and we're

00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:26,019
really excited actually to our two

00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:28,839
developers from Chan Tiffany in South

00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,669
Africa here in the front row are here

00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,859
and they're gonna be demoing in just a

00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:34,779
couple of hours a new digital product

00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,609
that Chan recently launched called soul

00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:38,499
medicine which helps women navigate

00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:40,479
through mental health issues if you're

00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:43,809
interested please do stop by at the

00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:45,460
connect space from 115 to 320 today talk

00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:48,330
to them hear more about soil medicine

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,919
and figure out how you can get involved

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,379
so I had the chance to hear at the same

00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,419
question I that I asked Andrew what is

00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:57,429
one wish you have for open source in the

00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:59,739
social sector and she said quite frankly

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:03,339
I just need a better way to manage the

00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:04,899
great network that I've created earlier

00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:06,519
I you heard me say you know a lot of

00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:08,649
open source projects generally can

00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,029
consolidate come through with one tech

00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:12,219
need and although it doesn't happen

00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,229
always there is definitely in cases

00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:15,909
quite a few cases in which private

00:23:14,229 --> 00:23:17,769
companies private tech companies find

00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:20,440
invested interest in that technique and

00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:22,059
give institutional funding or even able

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,129
to hire people who work on that project

00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:29,229
to dedicate full paid time to that work

00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:31,749
conversely in the social sector we never

00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:33,549
see that it is extremely rare even if

00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:36,729
the cause is near and dear to a major

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:39,009
organization very very rarely do we see

00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:41,200
any kind of institutional support given

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:43,690
to open source projects that address

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,460
that need and so people like Hara are

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,080
limited by the fact that she has to work

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,789
on this part-time she has a full-time

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,639
job and she has to manage all of this

00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:53,889
network on the side and so her wish for

00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:55,179
the open source in the social sector is

00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:57,099
really to look at the private sector

00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:59,409
models and figure out a more sustainable

00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:04,080
way to grow that network and become

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:07,029
sustainable well speaking of funding

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,830
since May we've been working with the

00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,899
case foundation on this great research

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,820
project and it's my pleasure to now

00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:14,830
introduce you to John Jones who is the

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,389
VP of interactive strategies at the case

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,389
foundation to give their perspective

00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,770
thanks so much small/small said I'm John

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,200
Jones I'm VP of interactive strategies

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,480
at the case foundation case foundation

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,030
is the family foundation of digital

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,950
pioneers Jean and Steve case who is our

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,930
mission to invest in people and ideas

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,460
that can change the world so we're

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,410
extremely excited to be partnering on

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,540
this project with github because we

00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,310
think open source and unleashing it for

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:48,370
the social sector is one of those

00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:50,800
world-changing ideas in fact we think

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,050
open source is a form of philanthropy

00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,660
and limitless form of philanthropy in

00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:57,700
fact one gift of open source code to a

00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,440
community can benefit a multitude of

00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,050
organizations attacking a similar

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,130
problem working on a similar mission

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,560
organization after organization can

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,300
benefit from that gift of code to debt

00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,280
better do their work and the value of

00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,140
that contribution only grows as more

00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,640
people give back to open-source projects

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,370
in all the many ways you can participate

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,310
in these projects we see this as a

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,770
hugely powerful resource for groups like

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,630
nonprofits and NGOs and those trying to

00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,460
change the world

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,230
and so with this research we are hoping

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:30,820
to unlock that philanthropic potential

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:32,260
that helped deploy it to the sector so

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,620
some of the ways we see ourselves doing

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,960
that is first looking at how can we

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,850
better inform product offerings for the

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,130
social sector what do they need to

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,960
better find open source projects to

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,700
better use them and better share them

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,920
and participate in an active digital

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,840
philanthropy themselves how do we

00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,610
produce educational materials for the

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,630
social sector through this research we

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,730
hope to understand where are the

00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:58,390
knowledge gaps where do people need to

00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:00,760
be educated on what open source is and

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,470
how you participated in as mala and Jean

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,330
explained and then deploy those

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,010
educational materials to the social

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,650
sector to onboard them to this great

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,150
ecosystem and then lastly we hope to

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,520
work with our peer foundations and other

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,020
funders to help them understand this do

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,570
the power of this digital philanthropy

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,250
and also show them how funding of

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,380
sustainable open-source projects can

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,330
benefit entire sectors and again help

00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,560
change the world we're very excited to

00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,660
be part of this research project and

00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,610
we're very excited to share it with you

00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,120
in early 2020 and put the findings to

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:31,100
work to create some real change

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:39,860
so with that I'm gonna pass it back to

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:43,100
Moloch thanks so much John earlier today

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,749
in the keynote you heard github really

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,279
is thinking about funding it's it's a

00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:48,379
huge challenge and it's part of the core

00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,389
sustainability issues of open source and

00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:52,700
I'm very excited to announce on behalf
