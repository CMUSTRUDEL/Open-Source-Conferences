Description: 
	This presentation takes audience through a journey to migrate from legacy deployment orchestration to Spinnaker. The legacy CD is a combination of TeamCity, command line tools, DCOS, slack and meetings. This scenario has multiple issues across security, change control and release management. Given TeamCity serves as both CI and CD, it has access across trust domains and failed the least privilege principle. In this scenario, deployment change control is limited due to relatively open permissions. Deployment pipeline configurations vary greatly and is lack of standardization. As a result, enforcing release processes is becoming more difficult especially when more micro-services are deployed into production. To improve deployment orchestration's security, efficiency, and manageability, launched deployment orchestration by Spinnaker. After migration to Spinnaker, we are able to standardize deployment pipelines, define and enforce permission policies, streamline release processes, enforce change control and separate CI from CD and reduce manual actions. As a result, release cycle reliability and efficiency are greatly improved.
