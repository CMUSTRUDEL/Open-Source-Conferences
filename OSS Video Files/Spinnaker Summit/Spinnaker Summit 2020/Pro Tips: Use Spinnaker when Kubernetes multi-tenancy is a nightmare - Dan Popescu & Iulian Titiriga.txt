Title: Pro Tips: Use Spinnaker when Kubernetes multi-tenancy is a nightmare - Dan Popescu & Iulian Titiriga
Publication date: 2021-01-28
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	At Adobe, we've been successfully using Spinnaker for over three years now and leveraged it to perform EC2 and Kubernetes based deployments. More recently, we've created a custom built process of onboarding namespaces as individual accounts for our multi-tenant Kubernetes platform. We wanted to achieve in a single pipeline execution namespace creation, account onboarding, application deployment and namespace deletion. This feature was needed for our preview environments that had to be short lived. In the past our clients had to manually generate the files needed for a new account and each onboard required a new Spinnaker sync. This was a tedious work and not a good client experience so we decided to go with a different approach. The presentation will share the process of developing this feature and the challenges we had to overcome from authorization, fast onboarding, config files generation and validation, dynamic account discovery and many others.
