00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,240
welcome to the final week of spinnaker

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,519
summit my name is ryan cartwright in

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,719
today's session i'm going to be talking

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,280
about five reasons

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,880
spinnaker aligns to thin serve business

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,400
initiatives

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,160
financial institutions ranging from

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
banks to credit card companies to credit

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,119
rating companies to financial services

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,119
are adopting spinnaker

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,760
before we begin here's a little intro

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,359
about myself

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,439
i've been with armory a little over two

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,440
years but prior to that i spent

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,559
five years working with some of the

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,079
world's largest companies

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,200
at vmware i'm also was a customer

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,559
at the beginning of my career in

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,640
infrastructure engineering at stanley

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,920
black decker

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,680
i went to business school at university

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,719
of north carolina i came in flagler and

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,399
did my undergraduate

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,559
degree at umbc university of maryland

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,160
baltimore county in my spare time

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
i like to sail on the bay in san

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,520
francisco and go scuba diving

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,960
around the world when i can some two of

00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,600
those passions i'm kind of missing right

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,199
now with

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
the covet so hopefully everyone's safe

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,520
at home

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,520
here's a a quote uh from 2008

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,560
a 2018 executive survey found that

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,560
nearly

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,479
80 of top executives said that they

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,520
feared disruption or displacement from

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,520
firms

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,960
like those in fintech sector or firms

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,479
specializing

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,080
specializing in big data the movement to

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,439
bring transformative and disruptive

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
innovation to financial services through

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
application of new and emerging

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,439
technologies which address consumer

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,280
needs through automation so how are

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,520
these spin server initiatives driving

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,040
financial service innovation well the

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,200
reality is changes come

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,320
slowly to financial services and

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960
innovation is preceded at an

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,479
evolutionary pace some would say glacial

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,880
however we've seen a bunch of

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,520
technological advances such as the atm

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,159
online banking bill payment and mobile

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,399
banking

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,000
and have enhanced consumer experience in

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
banking and payments while alleviating

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,040
costs increasing convenience

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
and streamlining processes

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,960
some of the advantages these fintech

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,799
companies have is not being encumbered

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,800
by legacy systems and processes

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,319
they're able to move faster and they're

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
able to develop solutions that compete

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,040
directly with traditional methods of

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,040
delivering financial services

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,560
here's a a poll that i saw from

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,879
cb insights famga for those that don't

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,440
know

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,200
stands for facebook apple microsoft

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,879
google and amazon

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,519
as you can see these these large five

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,879
tech giants are filing new patents

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,560
they're creating partnerships

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
they're creating products they're

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,120
acquiring companies and investments all

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,120
in the fin service space

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,200
another item that's accelerated things

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,519
recently is since the beginning of the

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
year

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,879
cova 19 has accelerated the shift away

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,760
from cash

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,959
with contactless and digital payments

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
see a couple quotes

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
from the wall street journal you know

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,519
visa mastercard

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
reported that 40 year-over-year global

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
growth

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,640
for tap to pay or contactless

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,000
transactions

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,560
so there's definitely a transformation

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,120
happening within some of these larger

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,959
larger fin-serve companies

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
so a few questions to ask yourself why

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
you're while you're going through this

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,720
presentation

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,319
do you care about moving fast or moving

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
faster than you are today

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,159
do you care about your customers do you

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,920
care

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,599
about driving a great experience to

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,720
those customers do you care about

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,040
reliability

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,640
do you care about predictability just

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
ponder on those as you as we go through

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
this presentation

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,159
i was watching a presentation last week

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,519
and kelsey hightower from google

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,599
was talking about we always say move

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,120
fast and the reality

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,959
he says he thinks most companies it's

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
not about moving fast can you move at

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,599
all

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,200
most companies are legitimately

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,760
paralyzed they're literally stuck doing

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,239
the same thing

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,680
over and over again like groundhog day

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
hoping there's no disruptions like an

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,120
attack from unwanted entity a security

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,720
vulnerability or something blows up

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,879
uh they're just in this stale waiting

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
pattern so these companies they just

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,599
need to be able to move

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,360
as long as you're moving forward in some

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,040
pace uh

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
they're tools like spinnaker that can

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,519
help you so goal number one should be

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,519
the ability to move

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,639
here's a quote from aj lang jp morgan

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
chase's cto

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,919
increasing the velocity of our software

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,919
delivery life cycle is what enables

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,600
development teams to iterate faster and

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,680
in turn increase our output of

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
innovative products and services for our

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
customers

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,360
and clients jpmc

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
has gone on record stating their

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,720
adoption of spinnaker you can see one of

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,080
their presentations live

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,000
from sandia at spinnaker live from our

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,000
conference our online conference in june

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,880
so here's here's five strategic tech

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,400
initiatives that we're seeing in

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,120
financial services

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,960
from empowering developers to replacing

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,440
change boards and manual policy with

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,240
with code replacing homegrown deployment

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,479
tooling

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,960
consistent paths to production and

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,120
leveraging multiple public clouds

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
uh or you know creating a hybrid cloud

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
environment

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,039
code that's not out of production is

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,759
inventory there's a conversation where

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,039
andy glover who now runs productivity

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,639
engineering at netflix who

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,840
used to be on the team that created

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
spinning curve on the delivery

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,680
engineering team

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,120
talked about inventory you know if you

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
think about traditional companies you

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
don't want a whole lot of inventory

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,240
if it's production ready put it in front

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,080
of your customers as confidently and as

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
rapidly as possible

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,520
so you can get a signal and either do

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,440
more or do less with it but every

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
company wants that regardless of domain

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,759
and you don't need to be

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,759
google or netflix to want that

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
in attempting to address this challenge

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,600
a lot of financial firms are trying to

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,360
hedge their bets

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
they're hiring developers by the dozen

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
and signing multi-million

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,639
dollar deals and contracts with cloud

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,840
providers such as aws

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,880
and google and microsoft their attempt

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,639
is really to increase

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,840
innovation velocity but at the same time

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
they're expanding their security and

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,080
compliance teams and retaining the much

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,680
dreaded change review board and attempt

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,319
to maintain safety

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,600
this approach is extremely expensive and

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,800
ultimately produces only incremental

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,840
benefits because it doesn't solve the

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,759
fundamental problem

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,680
security and compliance policies block

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,160
developers at the end of the delivery

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
process

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
instead of empowering and forming them

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
from the start

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,919
here's a handful of fin serve companies

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,680
that have gone on record that have rated

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,280
some case studies that have talked

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,960
at spinnaker summit about their public

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,120
adoption of spinnaker

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
so you can see jpmc the largest bank in

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
the us

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,039

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
chime is now the most valuable u.s

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,199
consumer fintech

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
transunion is an american's consumer

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,199
credit reporting

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,800
agency grab is the most well-funded

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,880
private fintech

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,160
fintech startup in the market in

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,840

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,080
despite modernization challenges

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,440
challenger banks show sustained user

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
growth so leading the way of those

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
challenger banks is chime

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,759
to chime they're getting they're powered

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,639
their software delivery

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,319
by spinnaker

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,400
another fintech that we just mentioned

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,080
grab you know here's a few other there's

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,599
established fintechs are launching

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,000
lending products to capitalize on

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,400
pandemic boosted e-commerce

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,120
grabs grabs been an early adopter of

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,080
spinnaker

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,639
that has over a thousand developers in

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,840
2019 prior to covet i had the chance to

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,199
to go to singapore

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,400
and was a user of grab

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,840
and actually had the chance to visit

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,840
grab in person in their office in

00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
singapore

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,759
here's a couple trends that we're going

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
to discuss and then i'm going to tie

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,639
this back to

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,319
these these initiatives and how

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,919
spinnaker can help

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,560
five digital banking initiatives for the

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,039
second half of 2020 they range from you

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,599
know enabling emerging technologies

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,400
continued innovation improving analytics

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,120
and insights

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,160
increasing customer engagement

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
leveraging the open

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
banking api partnerships and

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,919
strategically growing customer

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,000
acquisition accounts the continuously

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,279
changing landscape of 2020

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,640
it's important to adhere to the

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,000
customers continuously changing needs

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
when they decide to make their selective

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
trips into the branch

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,159
customers now whenever required clear

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,919
line of sight into the lobby experience

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,519
whether it's accurate wait times

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,560
on when they can meet with an advisor or

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,080
seeing how many people are actually

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
inside the branch

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,120
with lobby management your customers get

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,920
to the center banking experience around

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
their own needs

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,880
provide accurate branch information

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
while prioritizing the customer's

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,040
physical

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,800
safety inside the branch a few more

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,600
retail banking trends for 2020 and

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,279
beyond a couple that i'll focus on

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,880
is the focus on setting up new

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,240
innovative real-time payment services

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,519
that attract fintech companies and

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,360
consumers

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,720
for those still mostly offering

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,080
traditional banking services they're

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
going to shift away from their primary

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,880
focus and integration of new

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
technologies and enhancement of digital

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,399
offerings

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,720
with the emphasis on more value and

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,800
personalized client experiences

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,399
there's already a handful of large banks

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
that have invested in digital assistance

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,480
such as capital one

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,800
barclays bank of america usaa and u.s

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,800
bank

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,519
finally here's some financial services

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,560
industry challenges and opportunities

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,440
looking forward to 2021 you know

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,440
eliminating

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
data breaches each attack is costing

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
financial services

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
firms millions of dollars they need to

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,920
continue to come up with innovative

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
solutions to stay ahead of

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,560
these cyber criminals

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,640
firms must also modernize their

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,800
technology platforms and data storage

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,040
so they can enable big data solutions

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:05,200
such as ai supported digital

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:07,279
customer support assistance

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,279
and back to kind of the age-old question

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,360
do you build it or do you buy it

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,959
financial firms are faced with this with

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,640
this choice

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,000
i'm here to tell you buying it is

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,399
cheaper and it's faster than building it

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,040
spinnaker is taking six years of

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,120
learnings

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,959
from from netflix from google from

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,560
amazon from a bunch of other

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,480
large companies that you can see

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,480
contributing to spinnaker on

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,240
the dev stats which is now maintained by

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,760
the cd foundation

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,360
spinnaker is acting as a standard

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
library that you can start with the

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
standard library instead of building

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,839
your own

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,920
buying buying it really means seeking

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,079
partners to drive innovative

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,680
initiatives most firms are taking the

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
hybrid approach

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,399
there's a lot of developers and every

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,480
developer thinks they can build it

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,160
better but why would you do it better

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,240
we want developers to be focused on

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,519
business logic and don't toil away on

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,959
the glue code

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
about setting up infrastructure to

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,959
deploy your code if you don't see a

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,399
feature don't just throw away spinnaker

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,480
come to the community help us to build

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,480
it

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,560
let's jump into spinnaker i'm not going

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
to go into what spinnaker is there's

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,240
been enough sessions on that

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,680
during the time at spinnaker summit you

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
can see a lot of the benefits a lot of

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,000
your peers

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
other customers a lot of the commercial

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
vendors talking about spinnaker

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
you know there's a lot of recordings

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
dating back to the initial spinnaker

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
summit

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,160
for the past few years i'm here to talk

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
about

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,440
the five s's of spinnaker safe scale

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,480
secure speed and support

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,480
let's start with safe

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,839
there's a handful of things that that

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
spinnaker comes with that allows to you

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,560
to drive

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,560
a better customer experience you know

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,920
lowering your change rate failure

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,399
you know serializing your workflows into

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,760
both as code and a visual representation

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,800
of how you deploy

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,639
from code to cloud it's a standard

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
library for software delivery and you

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,680
get a lot of advanced deployment

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,440
technologies

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,120
such as blue green deployments automatic

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
canary analysis

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,240
and you just get benefits of having

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,519
things in version control you want to

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,639
start start with the right framework

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,959
because we have the

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,839
we have experience learned from the

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
industry leaders that have been

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,240
leveraging spinnaker for the past few

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
years

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
stop trying to recreate the wheel and

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,680
create another ci cd solution when you

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,720
can pick one up that's off the shelf

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,480
scale when we talk about scale as

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,160
these financial firms are moving into

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,200
the cloud you know

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,560
they're leveraging support from

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,360
different cloud providers whether it's

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,120
amazon google microsoft or even private

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,360
cloud providers such as

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,120
vmware tanzu or red hat openshift or

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
kubernetes on bare metal

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,720
there's first class support for these

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,600
cloud contracts there's integration to

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,800
multiple sdlc platforms

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,320
last year armory and engineering

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
community of spinnaker open sourced the

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,839
plug-in framework

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,880
so more and more sdlc platforms and

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,959
companies

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,800
are plugging into the sdlc to be able to

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,240
quickly add additional stages that

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,920
maybe didn't exist in prior years

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,000
your standardized cloud workflows and a

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,360
holistic view of your deployments

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,279
it's very application-centric you don't

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,839
see it from the infrastructure first

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,839
this is built for app developers

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,240
a quote from transunion they submitted a

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,440
case study last year to

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,040
the spinnaker.io they said we love the

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,240
simple command line interface for

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,839
administration

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,760
integration with multiple platforms and

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,440
easy configuring configurability using

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,120
pipelines

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,760
a lot of organizations will start within

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
the ui build out their constructs drag

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,480
and drop

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,600
figure out how to create their pipeline

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
and really

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,320
a pipeline can be as simple as grabbing

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,639
your artifact

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
building it deploying it running some

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,240
tests

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,480
as you make learnings over time you can

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,519
create more complicated pipelines

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,079
to meet your needs

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,399
two other extensions that have been

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,440
created to help with scalability are

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,040
pipelines as code and the armor agent

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
for kubernetes

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,480
these both have benefits as you start to

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,639
have

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,920
dozens hundreds thousands of pipelines

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,600
applications and

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,160
teams starting to use and standardize on

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,160
spinnaker

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,120
secure there's a lot of discussion

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,399
around policy driven deployments and

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,320
security as code

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,720
there's now integrations with uh open

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,760
policy agent which is another cncf

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,600
project

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,199
if you haven't heard of cncf take a look

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,120
at

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,839
or oppa take a look at opa take a look

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,519
at styra there's an integration now into

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,720
spinnaker spinnaker comes with automated

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,320
policy enforcement now

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
there's integration into secrets

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,079
management and there's automated

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,399
security testing and patching

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,480
you know there's also native integration

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,040
to our back for authentizy and just

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,040
into whether it's ldap or solutions like

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,680
octa

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,639
over the last couple months the

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,880
spinnaker community

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,120
has standardized on a cd process that

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,120
has

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
rankings and scoring systems for the

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,399
cvss scores

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,199
to fix those vulnerabilities before they

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,600
make it so now this aligns well with

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,040
other

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,040
banks and financial institutions

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,399
speed another reason to use spinnaker is

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,480
for speed it lowers your lead time

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,320
it increases your deployment frequency

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,880
it's lowering your mean time to recovery

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,759
and you get faster feedback loops code

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,440
that's not

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,199
out in production is inventory and you

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,360
don't want a whole lot inventory so

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,440
get it in front of your customers as

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,800
confidently and as rapidly as possible

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,560
so they can get a signal and either do

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
more of it or less of it but every

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,240
company wants that regardless of your

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,240
main

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,000
and finally the last s support there's

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,600
commercial support options available

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,120
there's a large and growing open source

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,279
community you can join the slack

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,720
community

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,560
there's different community events like

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,240
spinnaker summit like spinnaker live

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,360
there's a lot of meetups happening now

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,199
online meetups happening that are

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
discussing spinnaker and different use

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,120
cases

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,480
uh razzle benoit has done a great job

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,320
creating and organizing sprinkler

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,000
gardening days i hope a few of you

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
participating there's been a lot of new

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
integrations that have been coming out

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,320
of

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,839
the gardening days which is a virtual

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,160
hackathon that's been taking place

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,199
over the course of spinnaker summit and

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,399
finally there's a bunch of special

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,399
interest groups that

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,279
can allow you to get involved these

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,800
range from kubernetes to

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,320
security to onboarding to uiux

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
there's a lot of topics that are in

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,320
there and they all can use some help so

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,959
feel free to join in go to the spinnaker

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,959
page they're all on github to check out

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:53,279
the historical meeting minutes

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,480
here's another quote from jpmc from

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
stephen flaherty

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,000
he's the head of core engineering and

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,199
enterprise architecture

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,839
i won't read this but you can just kind

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,839
of read this for yourself

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,520
kind of bring it home again the five

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,520
bestest of spinnaker

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,959
safe scale secure speed and support

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,079
i'm going to align these to some of the

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,760
initiatives we talked about from the

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,000
financial services world

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,319
so safety it's the commitment to digital

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
delivery your customers your consumers

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,840
want to be able to deposit checks from

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,280
home they no longer want to go to the

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,320
branches all the time

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,840
especially now with cobit so having

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,760
safety this allows you to

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
drive digital delivery and innovate to

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,080
keep up with your customers demands

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,320
scale there's a lot of initiatives going

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,120
on with the open banking and

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,720
the open banking api as this expands

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,160
into more and more banks

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,080
you're going to need to have this scale

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,520
so you can integrate with this faster as

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,400
things change

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,520
security you know eliminating data

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,120
breaches

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,520
speed keeping up with all the different

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,919
regulatory changes that are occurring

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,120
and then support exceeding customer

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,120
consumer expectations

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,840
if any of this resonated i know we just

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,679
kind of touched on a

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,120
