cheryl thank you so much for moderating

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,200
for us today of course and thank you i

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,119
am honored to be alongside both of you

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
in this virtual world today

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,920
first let's talk a little bit about the

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,479
myth that perpetuates black talent who

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,439
are in the pipeline looking for roles

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,079
so recently the ceo of wells fargo

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,240
stated

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,399
that there's not enough black talent to

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,360
fill certain roles which is why

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,759
there's such an a small number of black

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,240
people

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,880
in professional positions i think that's

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,119
a myth

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,719
but i would love to hear what you all

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,880
think about the fact that

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,880
that statement was made and is often

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,799
believed and practiced throughout many

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,240
different industries

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,920
um well i'll jump into that um there's

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,200
actually kind of three things from my

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,319
perspective with that

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,959
um first it's not a diverse

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,599
talent issue but i see it as being an

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,959
issue with

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,000
diverse pipelines um so where are you

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
recruiting from

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
who are you allowing through your

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
initial filters

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,080
as you go through recruiting um and then

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,800
after that once you do have

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,120
your diverse talent in your company

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
how are you utilizing them are they

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,319
actually filling

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
the role technical or otherwise that you

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,000
hired them for

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
or are they being underutilized and

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
falling into

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
admin roles that aren't directly related

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,560
are they picking up

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,319
different work that's outside of their

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
their job description

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,560
and then once they're there it's also

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,920
then a retention issue

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,200
um why are we seeing people leave

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,519
different spaces

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
um are we creating environments that

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,080
encourage people to

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,080
to stick around with your company or are

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,440
these environments that aren't nurturing

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,760
for your diverse talent yes

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,800
i think those are three excellent points

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,319
nikima what is your experience

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,440
um i would like to like

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,640
piggyback on what angie just said um

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,879
about

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,440
a lack of diverse pipelines because

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,360
you can't complain that you can't catch

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,480
fish if you don't

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,680
go to the waters where fish are so

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,280
that's right the idea of

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
we don't know where to find black talent

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,480
i just think

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,000
it's it's a poor excuse and there's

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,920
i am feeling like nervous but um

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
yeah so i'm trying to like slow down

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,680
breathe but um

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,120
it's a poor excuse and it really

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,120
shouldn't be

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,439
accepted as an excuse um

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,799
if you know where to look we're out here

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,720
so

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,599
it's if you're looking in places where

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,519
we're not you're not going to find us

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,799
yeah i hear that and and i want to

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,079
address the fact that

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,919
recently i was in a company um

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,000
and one of the people said well why do

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,600
we have to focus on black people

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
right and this will lead into the second

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
part of this question like well why do

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,400
we just have to focus on y'all why

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
shouldn't we be focused on everybody

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
we have to stop with this zero tolerance

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,040
idea that oh if we focus on them

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,479
we got to forget about them right if you

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,240
really want to think about

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,759
who needs to be in the building first

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,199
you have to answer the question of who's

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,040
not already there

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
and you have to look proportionately at

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,240
who exists

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,759
right and so one of the ways that

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,600
companies need to solve it is first

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,600
start with who's not in the door

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
because for example if your company is

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
85 90

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,400
white and you're a white person and

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
you're asking why do we have to focus on

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,360
them

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,199
well 90 of your company is white they've

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,080
been focused on you obviously since they

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,400
open

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,320
so now what does it look like to have to

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
create spaces to focus on everyone else

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,240
we're not saying that

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,199
them focusing on you is wrong but what

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,720
is wrong

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,160
is the fact that they're not focusing on

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,199
anyone else whether it's because of

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
nepotism

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
or where you choose to go when you are

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
comfortable recruiting just like nakima

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,919
said

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
you have to think more about who's not

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,919
there and how do we get them in the door

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
for the second part of that question

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,440
would love to think about what i would

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,199
love to talk about what do you think

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,960
companies could be doing better

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,479
to get people in the door and naked i'm

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,919
going to come back to you first

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,240
because you made a really excellent

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,680
point about you can't get fish

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
if you go fishing where there are no

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,520
fish all right

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
so say a little bit more about what what

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,880
could a company do

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:50,720
to solve that issue um

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:54,320
yeah so i have this kind of

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,440
um professional call to action which is

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,720
open the gates and i think

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,080
if you want to start

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,120
at the college pipeline um the very

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,240
least you can do

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,080
is to start looking at the hbcus and

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,280
give them as much respect

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,000
and exposure to your company as you give

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,000
other schools

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,160
i recently read on twitter

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,360
about like an account from a recruiter

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
who just talked

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,759
they talked about how terribly the

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,960
students at the hbcus were treated um

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,520
by recruiters from a tech company

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,160
where they would have the event for the

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,000
hbus

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,280
cu students happen the day after

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,840
their iv event and

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,039
served them leftover food from the night

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,479
before

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,520
um had it like in the middle

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,639
of the day like just like in

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,120
a non-ideal time period so that people

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,639
can

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,759
like reach the event um and it's just

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,639
there's this this baseline lower level

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,720
of respect

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:13,599
when it comes to recruiting black people

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:17,759
and i just think the first step would be

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,360
to not to not see this as

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,280
how do we reach black people but like

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,199
how do you respect the candidate

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,840
in general like we should be treated

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,880
equally at least

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,840
so i think number one if

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,360
if you're looking for college grads look

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,240
at all the colleges

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,880
and if you are wanting to increase the

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,599
diversity like it would make sense to

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
look at schools that have more diversity

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,520
but

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,479
beyond that i think we also should

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,879
open the gates and open it wider to be

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,639
on

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,560
the college pipeline because there are

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,160
people like myself

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,520
who are adults who are career switchers

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,400
who bring a lifetime of experience

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,599
to these roles and we're needed in this

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,639
industry

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,919
but we are kind of cut out of the

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,599
process

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,199
so i'll stop there that's a great point

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,120
and angie you made three really

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,039
spectacular points as well

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
what and when you think about all of the

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,720
points that you made

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,080
around recruitment and retention even

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,360
when they get in the door

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,560
what do you think companies could be

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,400
doing better to improve those numbers

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,680
well um yeah to kind of follow up with

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,959
what nakeem is saying so first things

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,440
first is you know as you're bringing new

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,159
people

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,680
in to your organization i think a lot of

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,560
organizations still

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,160
uh leverage you know word of mouth and

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,200
referrals from

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,399
existing employees and so

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,000
not saying that you know individuals in

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,320
your workspace may not have

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,760
diverse social groups or professional

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
groups but

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,320
if that's your only way of recruiting

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,560
you're going to get more people

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:10,480
like the people who are already there

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,920
and so that's one space where you can

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,160
make a difference is

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,600
you know not leaning so heavily into

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,399
that word of mouth and

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
and why people like using that is

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,760
because then you

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,200
get this idea of it'll be a good culture

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,720
fit because these are direct

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,959
recommendations but

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
should really be looking at culture ad

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,080
not culture fit

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,880
with our organizations and that

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,800
you know goes directly into what nakima

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,519
was speaking about which is

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
um you know recruiting from different

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,760
places and

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,959
being willing to take someone not from a

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,720
computer science

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,480
background if you're talking about being

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,760
here in the tech industry

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,600
looking for people who have uh

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,080
related skill sets from different

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,120
industries or different type of work

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,399
that lean into the way that we

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,640
think in the tech industry um what could

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,360
companies be doing better once you have

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,360
people

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,560
kind of in the door is um

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,079
you know not shying away from the

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,680
conversation that

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,800
uh diversity matters um

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,839
it also helps if you know you're

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,959
not just um kind of

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,160
hiring your one of something so that you

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,680
meet some sort of

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,560
diversity quota um yes

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,360
as someone who's who at other times in

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,480
in my career

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,200
have have experienced being the only of

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
something

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,560
in a room um that's really isolating and

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,240
it

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,320
it gets really lonely um and sometimes

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,240
difficult having to think about how

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,200
you're having to

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,800
you know uh kind of give context into

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,160
how you might be feeling one day

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,200
because of something that's happened in

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,720
your community uh having to explain

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,360
um why today this new cycle was just

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,399
extra tough than than normal you know

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
there's a lot of

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,920
extra kind of emotional and mental work

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,720
that goes into

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,680
kind of being the only of something so

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,600
um

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,440
you know creating not just one to

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,519
check off a box but really looking

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,160
holistically as bringing in

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,519
you know cohorts of people uh so there

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,079
is a

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,079
a a sense of community uh there to

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,360
support as well

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,560
yes i think both of you make spectacular

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
points about that

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,959
and i'm going to add the context of even

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,839
before you go out to recruit candidates

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,200
directly

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,920
you need to check the way that you

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,399
define talent because talent also in

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
companies has an extreme bias related to

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
it

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,240
and that bias can even show up in the

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
way that we create job descriptions

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,519
right research shows us and there are

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,760
companies now that are working

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,560
to take to include more inclusive

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,639
language

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,399
in job descriptions where marginalized

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,320
and underrepresented populations

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,839
tend to shy away especially women and

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
people of color

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
angie you made the point about how

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,079
diversity matters

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
and diversity i'm going to add the

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,200
context that diversity matters when

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,959
you're getting people in the door

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,880
and it matters with who you have

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,880
interviewing those talents

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,079
are candidates because it is extremely

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,320
important to have diverse

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,839
interview panels for people who have a

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,639
number of different identities that

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,279
don't just

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
need to be visible so be thinking about

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,120
the fact that when you are recruiting

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,800
when you are creating job descriptions

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
what kind of diversity do you want to

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
add to that role and what kind of

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,560
competency or qualification can you put

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,440
in the role that might stand out to that

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,279
person

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,040
because again the fact that angie

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,639
brought up cultural addition

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,160
if you want to bring someone in you said

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,320
they're not like the rest of your team

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,079
well that can be a great thing right but

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,720
do they have the skill sets to do the

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,160
job

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,079
and are they going to come into your

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,600
space and enhance some of your cultural

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,000
values that you might have

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,839
around diversity equity and inclusion

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,120
just some quick points for you all to

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,399
think about

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,000
now let's transition a little into what

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
has been your experience when you're

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
looking for diverse candidates and i

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,360
want to reiterate that

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,279
we're talking about visible and

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,200
invisible and if you've ever been in a

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,560
role where perhaps you weren't directly

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,160
seeking out candidates

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,399
let's talk a little bit about your

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,240
visible and invisible diversities

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,639
and how those have impacted your

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
experience as a candidate looking for a

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,399
role

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
and we'll start with angie this time

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,480
okay so

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,720
some of my experiences around finding

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,920
diverse talent

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,519
of different sorts to fill roles in

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,639
the companies i've worked with

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,680
has had a lot to do with

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,360
for example as cheryl mentioned

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,199
working with the hr or people teams at

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,320
our organization to

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,880
really evaluate

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
the language used in our job postings

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,800
you know

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,279
you want to use inclusive language you

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,480
know

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,600
saying looking for a person

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,639
looking for a candidate

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,639
you want to

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,600
you know make sure that you include

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,639
the option for people to self-identify

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
as other minority groups but something

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,839
that's

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,320
a really helpful tip is as you're going

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,360
through

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,680
and reviewing resumes

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,920
it seems counterintuitive but sometimes

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,880
it's nice to not look at those self

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,120
identifying categories first on your

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,199
first glance through the resume

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,639
um so that it doesn't trigger any sort

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,720
of um

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,199
you know uh implicit bias that you may

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
have

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,040
kind of working in the back of your mind

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
um i found that to be

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,880
really helpful so you really are looking

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,839
at merits first

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,160
and then going back and looking at those

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,480
self-identified

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,480
um

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,760
areas and then in addition to that as

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,959
well

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,560
um you know there's multitude of studies

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,680
that show that there are

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,839
implicit biases around different names

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,199
so if you want to kind of hide those as

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,839
well in your

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,680
first pass i think that's a helpful tip

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,600
as well

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,079
yeah i think that you make a great point

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,079
about implicit bias and how it shows up

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,600
and eliminating factors that can trigger

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,839
unconscious bias

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,759
so i'll elaborate on that a little more

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,720
but before i go into my spiel nakima

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,880
what about you

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,320
whether as a candidate or someone who is

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,160
hiring a person

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,000
what kind of visible and invisible

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,480
diversities have you seen

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,920
show up and how have those impacted your

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,720
experience

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,759
um yeah i think i'll try to answer that

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,240
from both

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:57,120
perspectives um because i am a ceo of

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,639
my company and i haven't gotten to the

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,079
point of

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,720
being able to hire yet but

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,399
i think one of the things that i

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,000
consider a competitive

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,759
advantage is that i see people and i see

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,240
people who

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:19,199
are overlooked and underestimated so

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,000
and that's basically because of the life

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,360
that i've lived

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,720
and the perspective that i'm coming from

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,639
so i guess yeah as a candidate

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,079
not only am i a black woman

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:37,759
and i feel like going into these

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,279
tech interviews that was

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,040
a strike against me or two strikes

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,040
against me but not only do i have that

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,440
um and i'm proud to be a black woman so

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,279
it's not an internal problem

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,199
it's it's how i feel i'm perceived by

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,600
the outside world but in addition to

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,880
that

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,920
i come from

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,319
a position of being low income

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,679
i come from a position of dealing with

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,319
the

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
the consequences of that of of not

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,720
having enough

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:16,720
money to live off of so that means

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,400
my health suffers my attention i can't

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,079
bring my full self because my full self

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,280
is not okay

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,280
so it becomes this this layering of

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,760
trying to mask what's really not okay

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,360
and still trying to present your best

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,280
foot forward

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,960
and then you have everything else in the

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,039
world on top of that

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,400
and in addition to race gender

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,160
income status i also have

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
hidden disabilities i have

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,480
neurodivergence

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,640
so there are a lot of things that i have

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
to

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:03,760
i have to calculate and try to

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,760
mask these issues that are really

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,840
pressing they're really affecting my

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,480
performance

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,320
and i still have to push through all of

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,480
those things

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,160
to an audience that i don't think really

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,679
sees me

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,400
so back to that competitive

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,000
advantage i see people i see people i

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
can see their talent i can see their

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,480
potential

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,760
and i think it's because i

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,360
do find myself the only one

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,360
like me in a room and i miss the people

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,360
who aren't there i miss

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,320
i look around and i miss them so

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,960
i don't know if that i went off on

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,919
something

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,000
cause i don't know if i am question i

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,400
love the way you went off it tied right

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,320
into the next topic so if you want to

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,919
ever want to go off again feel free to

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,600
do that

00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,720
but i really love the idea that you

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,559
talked about all of the different

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,480
identities that you have

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,559
and i think that that relates one to the

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,160
way bias shows up because when you are a

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,520
person who is marginalized

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
if you are going into a space where

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,240
nobody looks like you you are more

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,559
in you are more uh what's the word

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,240
of course obsessive to bias right it's

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,919
acceptable to bias

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,280
and so i think it's really important for

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,640
us to understand that

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
with all the different identities that

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,360
you have especially if they are

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,960
marginalized whether visible or

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,559
invisible we are more likely to

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,919
encounter bias where other people don't

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,360
have those identities

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,679
which really takes us into the

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,080
conversation about intersections

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,799
right and so so what does it mean to

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,679
have

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,280
those intersections and if you've never

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
understood the term intersections you

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,240
should look it up first of all it was

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
coined by kimberly crenshaw who is also

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,880
a black woman

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,799
now if you want to look up the research

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,720
feel free to is very in-depth and lots

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,240
of people use the word intersectionality

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,039
today and it's becoming even more

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,280
prevalent

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,039
again in our conversations but what it

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,280
is is it's a point at which

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,280
two or more of your socially categorized

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,440
identities meet and intersect

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,960
it's like they're crossing a road so for

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,799
example let's talk about funding if

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
we're raising funding as business owners

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,559
or people in a business

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,600
what we know for sure and what data

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,600
shows us is that three percent of women

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,880
receive venture capital funding that

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,080
means that three percent of venture

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,120
capital funding

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,400
goes to women right but if we look at

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,640
the intersections

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,320
only point eight percent of that funding

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,720
goes to black women

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,919
you see when our intersections show up

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,080
they can show us how to

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,919
find the differentiations in the data

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,880
that impact the outcomes that show us

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
that there's bias

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,080
in multiple industries and venture

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,159
capitalism

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,200
is just one example of that when there

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,679
are many

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,280
right so when you think about your

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,679
intersections and leukemia you talked

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,240
about

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,840
a little bit a lot actually which led to

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,720
this transition

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,320
is i'm going to start with angie though

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,480
talk to me a little bit about your

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,159
intersections angie and how do they show

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,240
up and what does that look like

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,440
in the workplace yeah i can kind of take

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,679
you through a few different

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,280
phases of my career because things kind

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,640
of change a little bit

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,960
and how they've shown up um i

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,679
kind of really resonated with what

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,720
nikima

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,760
mentioned about i you know coming from

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,440
low income that's a part of

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,799
my growing up in atlanta as well

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,240
and so one thing in my early career

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,320
fresh out of college that was very

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,440
difficult was

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,720
this idea especially here in dc

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,280
of unpaid internships like that's how

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
you

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,600
get your foot in the door of certain

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,799
types of organizations

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,480
and like that's great

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:49,440
but i had no support or other funding

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,080
from family or anything to kind of see

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
me through

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,440
those multiple months of being unpaid

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,880
for really valuable work i was doing

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,600
so in addition to you know an unpaid

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,400
internship

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,200
i was also working two other part-time

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,559
jobs

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,679
in order to afford to live in dc for

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:13,039
that unpaid work um and

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,720
that leads to you know i mean that's

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,039
being very busy that's getting less

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,720
sleep than maybe some of my peers

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:24,960
that's affecting my ability to come to

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,600
that opportunity as my full self um

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,320
and then kind of once i made the

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
transition

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,240
and and then got more into the tech

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,679
space um specifically

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,360
um you know i think

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,760
um there there always has been and there

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,720
continues to be this interesting

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,360
intersection i have with um being

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,280
actually

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,159
uh multiracial so i do identify

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,559
first and foremost as a black woman you

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,520
know

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,280
that's culturally how i grew up those

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,840
that's who the people who were around me

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,440
were

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,600
um that that's who i am but

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,000
i also happen to kind of sort of present

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,240
as my other identity which is an asian

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,679
woman as well

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,159
and then i'm also a woman and so

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,159
no matter what i i'm never quite sure

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,679
when i enter a room

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,480
what do others perceive me as and how do

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,799
those perceptions that they have about

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,159
any one of those identities play into

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,840
how they're interacting with me

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
how they're listening to me how they're

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,240
reacting to

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,400
how i'm presenting myself you know from

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,600
all sorts of stereotypes and assumptions

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,280
you know am i

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,039
am i being too aggressive right now or

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,400
am i being too meek

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,640
right now um am i letting things slide

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,720
in this male dominated field because you

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,679
know it's like really hard to

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,080
sometimes stand up for yourself all of

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,320
those identities come into play

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,679
when i'm sitting in a room especially

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,080
with new people

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:05,440
um every day is different

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,440
and none of that goes away um i guess

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,919
it's just one of those things where

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,640
i've gotten more comfortable with myself

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,080
so

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,520
over time i've maybe

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,000
stopped tailoring how i act based off of

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,760
how i

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,080
think others may be perceiving me in

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,559
that moment but i mean even now

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,760
you know more than a decade later it's

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,559
still something that

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,880
every so often kind of rears its head in

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,240
my

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,159
in my daily interactions yeah

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,080
and and i think that's so powerful with

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,919
all the examples that you gave

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,799
about you know i'm my multi-racial

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,520
some days are those identities always

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,520
stick with you

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,440
right they never leave you and it's

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,159
about the difference i think shows up in

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,760
the room

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,679
depending on one who's in the room and

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,039
how they've encountered people who they

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,200
feel are like you

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,320
right and and that that determines the

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,080
way that they treat

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,400
us and i think people don't truly

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,880
understand that the more marginalized

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,200
intersections you have the more barriers

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,600
it is that you have to overcome

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,279
in order to reach a place of equality

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,320
and interesting enough i run

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,679
a consulting firm i have two consultants

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,880
who are queer

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,880
black and have disabilities and we've

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,559
had to end relationships

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,960
with companies because of the way they

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,520
were treated because of the prevalency

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,679
of white supremacy's cultural norms

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,960
in a company right if you ever y'all

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,640
ever get a chance the people who are

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,720
viewing this go check out the 15

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,320
cultural norms of white supremacy

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,760
it will give you a lot of information

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,480
about how those things show up in your

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,640
company

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,720
because when people show up different to

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,360
people who are not used to different

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,679
then the outcomes tend to be challenging

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,880
and so just a reminder of that when you

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,039
are thinking about

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,720
what does it look like to support

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,480
someone equitably

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,720
at their intersection so that you can

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,600
create equal outcomes for them

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,039
and nakima you spoke a lot about that

00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,919
and would just love to hear a little bit

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,600
more from you

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,760
if you have other things to say as

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,279
you've heard us speak about blackness

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,600
and intersections and

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:13,840
how that impacts all of your experiences

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:17,039
yeah so i just came out of my job search

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,480
and i feel very lucky

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,200
to have landed where i did but

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
um one of the things that angie brought

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,400
up earlier earlier

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,919
was like kind of stripping away the

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,080
identifying

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,320
information from resumes and things like

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,320
that

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,679
and that was something that i thought a

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,120
lot about when i was looking for

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,120
work because um

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:49,120
i it's it's i go back and forth about it

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:52,080
because i don't want to be

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,080
discriminated against but i don't want

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,600
you not knowing who i am to be the only

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,919
thing that prevents that

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,919
because i just i don't think it's

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,640
and there's not a good clean solution

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
for that but

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,080
one of the things that i decided to

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,400
focus on

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,159
in my job search and as i was

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,120
interviewing companies

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,799
um was like you need to see me and you

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,399
need to value me

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,840
so if you see a black woman

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,840
with no college degree

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:33,360
with no prior experience

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,480
in a working in a tech role

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,799
um if you see that and that makes you

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,679
want to reject me then i want to be

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,360
rejected

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,080
i don't want to i don't want to put

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,360
myself in an environment where

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,159
i'm going to be put you know

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,760
i'm going to start off behind so i

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,760
really wanted to make sure that

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,039
that companies were looking for that

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,279
culture ad that i bring

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,880
that they were looking for that they

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,000
were able to see

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,600
not what i'm not or not what stereotypes

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,159
might dictate but what

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,720
i do have to bring to the table so

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,520
i guess luckily and unluckily i'm a very

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
bad

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,600
master like right now like i'm not

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,240
i can't act i can't act and it's really

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,279
hard

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,799
to intentionally lie and that includes

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,159
lying to myself

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,960
so i cannot

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,919
pretend to be anything other than what i

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,120
am

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,200
and i just made a decision somewhere in

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,520
the job search that

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,720
wherever i land like they need to see

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,480
see it all

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:50,000
and still want me like so

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,000
um yeah so the intersections i feel like

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,080
in tech especially

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,159
i don't i feel like

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,600
being black and being a woman

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,880
is one thing but i do felt i feel like

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,919
my income status was probably more of a

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,799
barrier than those

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,039
other things my income status and my

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,720
educational status

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,919
so yeah

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,279
and i think that's a good point because

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,120
i don't think people understand that

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,200
some can be a causation of the other

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,559
right like how interrelated they are

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,000
like when you look at low income

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,880
populations and you look at the

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,720
disproportion

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,399
proportionate number of who is

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
considered low income

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,919
that impacts that is directly correlated

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,760
to race

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,279
right yeah and so so we have to think

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,880
about the correlations of our

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,039
intersections because education

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,000
even comes to education and access you

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,840
have to realize it was

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,679
less than 100 years ago when schools

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,799
were being segregated

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,240
and desegregated and so the access that

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,600
we've had to education

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,440
and the people that that have happened

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,919
to are raising us

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,360
and that's part of our professionalism

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,760
and i think you made a really good point

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,679
about going where you are appreciated

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,600
um and what does it mean to truly be

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,039
appreciated and you both make the point

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,200
about authenticity

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,880
and being your authentic self and being

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
able to go into a workplace

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,960
and see a culture that allows you to be

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,159
authentically yourself

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,600
and of course we're not going to bring

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,640
our whole selves to work there are

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,399
pieces of us

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,640
that we have that just don't we don't

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,480
want to show up in the workplace

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,559
but for the pieces that we do we

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,559
shouldn't have to cover them

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,960
and and that can be our language our

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,399
hair the way that we dress our behavior

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,360
the way that we speak

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,159
right it is so interesting that all of

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,960
these factors

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,000
we always have to think about and i

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,760
think that you both

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,640
have some commonality and talking about

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,399
how often you have to think about them

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,600
because if you are in a space where you

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,320
don't have to think about your

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,880
identities

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,640
impacting your outcome your opportunity

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,200
that's privilege

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,000
right and so as we think about our

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,840
intersections

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,080
and our whole self and our authentic

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,039
self what would you tell a company they

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,440
could do better

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,240
to support you as you are that person

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,120
and finding out or realizing sometimes

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,240
in the midst of trauma and challenges

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,240
who you are

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,000
how can a workplace show up for you what

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:20,080
what one thing you would tell them to do

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,919
um i can start i guess um

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,039
i'm big on psychological safety

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:30,080
and i think

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,600
maybe yeah if you could

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,640
show that you are educating yourselves

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,320
and your your culture

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,159
like you're working towards a culture of

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,200
inclusion like show

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,159
that with actions

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,600
like when i when i come into a new

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,960
culture i want to see that

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,679
that you're working towards something

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,760
better because i know

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,679
especially i don't know of a tech

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,039
company that i can praise right now and

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,760
say like they're doing a really great

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,559
job with their diversity and

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,880
culture of belonging i i don't know that

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,440
i

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,360
haven't experienced that like to the

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,880
point where i would praise

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,440
so i would like to see effort

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,960
and i would like to see receipts like

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,559
show me that you're working on this

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,480
culture and show me that

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,559
you want me here and that you're going

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,880
to do everything that you can to make me

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,080
feel

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,440
safe in this environment

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,600
yes um

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,519
i i'm so happy nikima mentioned

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,799
psychological safety

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,440
um one thing that i found and i

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,240
i understand that not every company has

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,679
the

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,960
funding to do something like this but

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,399
um one thing i've found um

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,600
really just great is the the offering

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,120
of um you know sort of

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,200
uh counseling and like professional

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,159
counseling personal counseling

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,440
either through um you know an employee

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,039
benefits program

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,720
or just kind of separately

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,760
through another organization where um

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,640
you know i've had the freedom to talk

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,519
to someone who is not a part of my

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,720
company

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,760
but is a resource provided to me by my

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,919
company

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,760
where i can go and talk about these

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,120
types of things whether it's my own

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,679
professional development within the

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,039
company

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,279
whether it's you know i'm having a

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,399
really hard time showing up at work

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,480
today because of

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,159
the nature of the world right now and

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,640
and how they impact me

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,679
and my loved ones in ways that i don't

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,799
know that others

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,279
around me at work really understand

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,480
having that resource there like that

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,159
costs money that's

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,679
money that the company is putting out

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,559
there

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,679
show me that it's valuable to you um so

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,559
that's a

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,360
very very specific way that i've

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,559
experienced

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,120
that um as as sort of a company offering

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,399
to me

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,000
and just like nikima said i mean there's

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,280
a lot of

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,919
like virtue signaling going on and

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,720
people saying things and and maybe

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,599
sudden

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,159
sort of uh features of your diverse

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,359
talent

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,359
on your website or marketing materials

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,000
but besides that what is happening

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,960
like is is it just a one year training

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,119
you're putting on

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,440
uh come on or is it a constant

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,679
conversation that's being brought up

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,639
um in different avenues in the workplace

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,760
like let's

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,560
actually see it not just hear hear it

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,040
and and not just in a flyer

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,919
yeah don't talk about it be about it we

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,919
want to see

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,639
impact we want to see results right what

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,960
do your okrs look like

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,880
right what are your kpis in your company

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,320
when it comes to racial equity we want

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,599
to know

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,480
um because you know it it matters to us

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,079
uh to see that progress is happening and

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,040
i think that you both talked a little

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,680
talked a lot about that and you brought

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,000
up

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,920
boundaries right so so when we think

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,119
about angie you really talked about what

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,720
it is that you need

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,800
when you're not feeling so hot

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,240
especially in a black body

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,480
and in the age of 20 20 when

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,760
let's be clear awareness is at an

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,520
all-time high

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,960
because the themes and issues that are

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,440
happening in this country

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,880
are not new human beings are just

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,760
becoming more aware of the fact that

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,760
they're happening

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,079
at the prevalency that they're happening

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,280
especially to our communities

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,160
and so i'm interested in knowing what do

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,680
you do

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,440
when you wake up in the morning and see

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,280
another black person has been murdered

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,680
at the hands of police

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,440
and you know that this is something

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,560
that's impacting you as you have to go

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,520
out into the world

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,000
or commute to work or go to the store or

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,560
go for

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
a jog and you walk into a workplace

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,839
where there's not a lot of people that

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,760
look like you

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,760
what has that experience been like for

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,119
you and just in general

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,960
but especially in 2020 even prior to the

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,520
pandemic causing us to have to work from

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,599
home

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,720
or to be in a virtual world where you

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,000
have to still

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,680
show up on camera with that stuff still

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,880
in the back of your mind or the front of

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,000
your mind

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,599
let's start with angie um

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,720
so i'm lucky right now to work for a

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,920
company

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,800
that i think really does

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,839
try to see people as whole people and

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,440
not just the

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,240
employee that's supposed to show up

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,280
every day so i do know that this is

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,839
not something everyone can do but i am

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,119
privileged

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,480
to be able to do is that i unplug

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,079
um so if i need to say you know what

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,440
actually this is a mental health

00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:01,040
day um i'm taking the day

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,800
um and it's not for me to be unaware

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,200
um it's not for me to not participate in

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,920
the

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,520
conversations it is sometimes to protect

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,400
myself emotionally

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,359
uh one from either doing emotional labor

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,800
that day that

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,920
just really shouldn't be mine to do um

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,640
but also i am already aware

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,440
like you mentioned cheryl like the the

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,640
things

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,520
happening in 2020 are not new black

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,280
people have been

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,040
aware of it uh for ages

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,800
um i'm already aware um

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,800
so i unplug to protect myself

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,160
on those days where that hit me extra

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,599
heavy um

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,920
and i come back to the conversation

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,119
when i when i feel better about it when

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,280
i'm

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,760
able to you know at least work my way

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,760
through

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,040
emails if it's something that i can't

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,440
pull away from then

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,960
like you mentioned in this virtual world

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,920
um

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,560
you know maybe i won't be camera ready

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,640
that day

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,280
maybe all you can get is audio from me

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,079
on a phone call but i do

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,119
even if it's small things like that try

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,640
to take

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:20,079
steps to protect me first

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,079
yeah and i you said a phrase

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,160
that really really hit home about having

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,760
to do the emotional labor

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,400
right because now not only are you

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,960
battling your own internal war

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,480
around fear when things like that happen

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,200
but now i got to go to work and my

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,920
co-worker

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,040
and 50 other people ask me how are you

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,440
doing today

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,400
i don't want to answer that question

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,760
right

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
i'm feeling like i don't want to answer

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,400
your question

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,160
what are you gonna say angie it sound

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,800
like you were about to say something

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,000
yeah i i just that that's the thing it's

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,000
you know

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,839
don't ask me how i'm doing it probably

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,960
as well as you might think

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,680
you know which is not great um when i

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,320
see

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,599
you know things like that uh you know

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,720
another black man

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,440
shot by police officers

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,320
in my head i'm seeing my brother in my

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,240
head i'm

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:19,280
i'm seeing my cousins my uncle my dad

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,280
my grandpa and there's

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,200
sorry it's a little emotional these are

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,000
people who who are my heart

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,480
right this is my family these are people

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,599
uh

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,800
closest to me and i

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,920
see them in the him

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,200
in another video or in another story um

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,920
and so um

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,440
yeah generally the feeling is not great

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,599
and i don't want to be

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,359
your source of answers because i don't

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,280
have all the answers i

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,119
i you know in some ways don't really

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,920
know what to do about a problem like

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,960
that

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,880
um right but it's so prevalent in

00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,000
our day-to-day now it's it's exhausting

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,520
um so yeah i i have to

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,720
protect myself and you know take time

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,400
that i need

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,560
um to protect myself from those

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,359
conversations when it's a day that i

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,760
can't

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,680
get those images of the people i love

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,000
out of my head

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,960
yeah and and nakima you are a parent

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,160
correct

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,040
yes yes what what is that what's that

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,760
like for you just

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,240
in your black body but also knowing that

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,160
you know

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,520
you have other black bodies to raise i

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,760
think it's important for

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,079
our audience to hear both of those

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,280
experiences and perspectives

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,240
yeah so as a parent it's

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,280
really it's heartbreaking and it's kind

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,280
of this thing where

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,319
the best i can do most of the time is to

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,440
not think about it

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,000
because it's hard to balance my children

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,079
are 12

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,839
and 13 so they are getting to be big

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,760
and they're going to be seeing you know

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,400
black children in general are seen as

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,400
older

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,000
than they are or perceived as older than

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,440
they are and treat it that way

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,079
so um there's

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,359
they were never and i was never you know

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,800
given that

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,520
um assumption of innocence ever

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,200
like even as children as babies we don't

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,520
have that privilege

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,520
so it's really hard to

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:31,440
not to be honest and be open

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,720
and yeah honest about what the state of

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,520
things right now

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,280
but you don't want to crush their hopes

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,800
you know you don't want to

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,720
you don't want to feed fears

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,920
but you also feel like you have to

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,760
prepare

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,920
them for the world that for how the

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,079
world sees them

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,839
so it's it's a daily constant

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,319
heartbreak and it's it's this thing

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,839
where if we're talking about

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,359
intersections and

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,720
um we just like the more

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,160
of these you know compounding identities

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,800
that you have to

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,280
be aware of it's like having an open tab

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,760
running

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,000
all the time so i'm always saying like

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,960
i'm amazed by

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,800
how well we as black people function in

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,359
this society because we have to

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,200
have this hyper awareness of everything

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,599
because so many things that shouldn't be

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,839
our life and death situation for us

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,839
so it's

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,720
i think we as a people are doing

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,599
excellent like under the circumstances i

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,920
think

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,040
having to always have that constantly

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,319
running

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,319
cycle of never feeling safe

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,599
it's got to affect our productivity

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,319
and creativity and mental health and yet

00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,319
we still

00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,359
like press on and we still do amazing

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,880
things

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,280
so i'm gonna try to get through this

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,400
without crying and i probably won't

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,880
but and it is okay if you do

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,640
i know it's okay this is my thing like i

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,160
i always try to fight it so

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,440
i'll try not to fight it too hard um

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,200
but yeah just being so i'm new on my job

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,079
so

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,880
what what they have said is that we have

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,960
unlimited paid time off

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,200
um i feel like i have a relationship

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,040
with my manager where i can be honest

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:36,319
if i'm feeling like the world is

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,440
is burning if i'm feeling like i

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,359
i'm not functioning the way like i don't

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,079
feel productive i feel like i can't work

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,319
like i feel like

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,200
i can be honest about those things but

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,880
at the same time

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:53,200
i'm new so i don't want to

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,520
overstep and take too much

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,640
too much time off because i have i still

00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,319
have to prove myself

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,560
in this role so it's that has been an

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,319
internal struggle for me but like i said

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,040
i'm new i'm this job

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,319
and before then i was working on my own

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,079
company

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,000
primarily so i didn't really have to

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,680
answer to

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,680
anyone but i would say

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,000
a tactic that i have is having people

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,680
outside of

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,880
work who are a safe place to go to

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,440
and safe people to talk to

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,160
and people who you can cry and yell and

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,960
cuss and

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,800
whatever it is that you're feeling um

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,800
sorry

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,160
yeah but you have that outside of your

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,599
job because

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:48,000
chances are you're not going to find it

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:51,200
in the workplace that's real

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,280
yeah i agree and i i think that

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,040
when you both speak about boundaries the

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,319
thing i want to reiterate to our

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,079
audience is that

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,000
it's great for people to know their

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,800
boundaries for you to know your

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,119
boundaries

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,000
and for you to know their boundaries do

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,359
you know what i'm saying so

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
there's three components to how

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,000
boundaries exist and if and when a

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,760
person is in a space to talk to you

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,599
about something that is challenging to

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,119
them because like you all said

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,040
i think we're doing a pretty damn good

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,400
job of showing up at work even when

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,680
things are hit in the fan

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,920
i never forget i the day after

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,520
what happened to george floyd happened i

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,359
literally went on my linkedin

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,680
and every other linkedin post said

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,040
something in the realm of

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,960
i need to figure out how to show up for

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,480
work today and i

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,160
you know i went under people's things

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,480
and said do you do you have

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,839
you have a right to stay home you know

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,119
and that's a privilege to some of us i

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,319
get not every company has

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,839
unlimited pto but it for companies and

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,640
people who are watching this who are in

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,240
hr

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,760
i'm going to take the next conversation

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,640
about boundaries to thinking about what

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,960
it is that

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,720
you can do whether you are in hr whether

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,599
you are a vp of people culture

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,000
whether you are ceo of your company what

00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,040
is it

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,560
that you could do to create spaces for

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,640
employees to feel safe

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,960
when they are having very difficult

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,680
times what kind of systems can you

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,440
create

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,000
and i would love to hear from our panel

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,599
about what you think are some of the

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,520
best systems that work

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,880
within companies when people are

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,119
psychologically or

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,319
mentally or physically or emotionally or

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,880
spiritually

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,440
going through challenges what what do

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,680
you need

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:31,440
and how can companies provide it um

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:35,119
so i think for

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:38,160
myself this is and this is coming from

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,839
my personal experience um dive into a

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,319
little bit of frustration of what it's

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,800
like

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,400
to kind of for force yourself to show up

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,240
for work because

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,319
i mean we have jobs we've got to do them

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,520
right um

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,480
it's frustrating when you have to show

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,960
up to work

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,160
and you're processing a lot of this in

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,040
the background that

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,319
never ending open tab is there it's

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,280
frustrating because

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,640
in addition to that you know in my own

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,520
head i'm saying to myself

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,720
man today had so much potential i had so

00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,000
much potential

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,599
for this day if only

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,400
i weren't having to deal with this

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,160
if only i i weren't having to and i get

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,240
angry about that sometimes

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,400
it's more than frustrating i get angry

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,480
about that because it's like

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,480
i see that about myself i see that about

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,319
other co-workers i see that about

00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,760
you know people on the teams that i lead

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,079
where i'm like man when

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,839
this person's having a good day and

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,720
there are less hurdles in their space

00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,280
and there's less

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,200
things taking up that you know mental

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,920
turn in the back of their minds

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,400
like man they're really on it and that

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,720
feels good to be that on it

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,720
um

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,520
so it's really really frustrating when

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:57,520
you can't be um

00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:01,520
yes for me having that experience

00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:04,880
um when i when i see something maybe off

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,480
or when i know the context of what's

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,400
happening socially

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:14,319
in our world on a given day um

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,800
someone seems not quite in it um

00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:18,720
if they're comfortable i i try to

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,319
provide a really open

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,400
you know kind of space for conversation

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,559
so that people can can talk to me about

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,839
this on my teams

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,280
um when it comes to scoping out my

00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:34,400
project work yes

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,920
i work for a tech startup right like

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,000
we're trying to deliver

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:43,040
products fast and you know uh

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,800
you've got to make more money um

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,559
for for the company and you only do that

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,880
by delivering products but

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,280
i didn't take a look at okay what what's

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,400
the work that we have scoped out

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,359
not just for the individual you know but

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,200
for the team is there anywhere that i

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,280
can pull this back

00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,079
whether it's for today or for the next

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,400
two weeks what adjustments can i make

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,200
to the workload that still allows us to

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,000
deliver

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,760
for the company but allows us to make

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,599
some adjustments

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,520
so that there's space to breathe

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,839
because if i can create some space to

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,880
breathe in a short term

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,920
the potential of of

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,720
my team is is amplified

00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,359
later on when that mental turn when that

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,680
that

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,920
all that crime running in the background

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,160
isn't there so what can i do as a leader

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,280
to to pull back you know and it's a

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,960
balancing act

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,720
um but you know that's one thing that

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,319
i think is a common theme that we've

00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,280
talked about here is that

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,640
um black people are really good at

00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,599
balancing a lot of stuff

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,400
we shouldn't have to um it's a learned

00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,640
skill though

00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,119
that i think a lot of us have have

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,920
picked up along the way

00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,520
yeah and i think that you've made such a

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,920
critical point about

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,880
that balance right because we often talk

00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,520
about work-life

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,040
balance and while we're balancing the

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,200
systems in our workplace don't always

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,400
teach us how to integrate that

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,119
into our work our work and our personal

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,720
lives

00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,800
and so we have to think about work life

00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,440
integration in a black body

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,559
with all of these intersections and

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,319
that's a lens that

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,839
every company needs to have for every

00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,960
identity but since we're talking about

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,079
blackness today

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,280
i'm gonna talk about blackberries right

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,680
nakima what about you

00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,200
yes i feel like i don't have a whole lot

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,440
of

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,839
career experience to talk on this um

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,359
so i will just say what i'm thinking

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,800
about it

00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:52,839
um having just gone through

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:57,119
the tech job interview cycles

00:50:52,839 --> 00:51:01,280
um i know it it takes a lot of

00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:04,559
time money effort to hire someone

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,440
so you want to do what you can to

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,000
make their time there sustainable you

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,720
don't want

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,720
to burn people out so i think

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:21,359
yeah from a people perspective i guess

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,000
i don't know having being able to

00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,599
monitor

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,200
i don't know if that that makes sense or

00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,599
not because yeah this is all new to me

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,640
this is a new world for me but

00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,440
if you could be aware that

00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,520
your people who have are marginalized in

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,200
society are dealing with a lot more

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,559
than what's happening in the company

00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,520
and they're bringing that to work with

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:48,000
them like just having awareness

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:51,119
and again trying to create a safe

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,480
place for them to exist

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:58,000
i think is important because

00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,880
you don't want someone to push through

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,119
push past everything else in life and

00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,960
just

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:11,280
grind 100 on their work tasks

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,520
um because they're going to burn out so

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,960
so protect that time and that investment

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,559
that you've already made

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:22,000
and that employee and

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,319
try to make their time there sustainable

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,520
because you wanted them like you you

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,640
vetted them

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:32,240
they're there so like you want you want

00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:34,079
everyone to succeed yes and

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,760
i think you you made a fantastic

00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,640
statement about you invested in that

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,720
employee

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,839
now invest in the systems that they need

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,599
for support

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,599
and some of those systems just for some

00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,000
of you who are wondering are things like

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,400
unlimited pay time off unlimited

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,839
vacation time and i'm a ceo

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,040
and i know for other leaders in the

00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:51,839
company you're probably thinking but if

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,839
i give them

00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,599
unlimited paid time off or unlimited

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,160
vacation they never gonna get their work

00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,359
done

00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,280
that is not true and for those of you in

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,599
companies who think that employees only

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,200
work

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,119
need to work a nine to five monday

00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,000
through friday and that's when they come

00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,839
to work

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,920
you need to get out of that right

00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,440
especially in a virtual time where many

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,240
of us are working from home

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,160
or our caretakers and can't create the

00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,599
time to do a nine-to-five

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,040
you need to change the way that you

00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,960
examine how you accomplish your

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,319
milestones and that should be based on a

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,680
40-hour workweek

00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,160
it should be based on a person's

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,160
availability and your timeline

00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,079
and so i'm saying as you are practicing

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,480
these things get away from a nine to

00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,480
five

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,800
five days a week six seven days a week

00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,640
schedule and go to milestones and say

00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,079
how much time do we need to accomplish

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,760
the milestones that we need

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,359
and what do you need to get it done

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,200
because that's just a more inclusive way

00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,119
of accomplishing tasks without

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,440
inequitably and punish punishing your

00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,920
employees during a pandemic or just

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,559
in general who have different life

00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,440
structures or familial structures etc

00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,960
whatever the boundary is or the identity

00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,079
is that the boundaries that you have set

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,359
up in your workplace

00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:05,040
have made a challenge now is the time to

00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:05,520
undo those things right now as we think

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,760
about

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,040
workplaces actually showing up and i'm

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,520
gonna lean in

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:16,720
and wink in the beginning of 2020

00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:20,640
we seen so many equity

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:23,040
statements so many every other company

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,400
on their website on twitter oh and

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,359
whatever

00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,760
their medium they use has something to

00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,920
say

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,839
about how they wanted to show up for

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,240
equity and how they want to perpetuate

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,000
equity and support black lives matter

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,359
and for many of these companies who i

00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,920
have known and known

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,200
in that company i'm like you can't even

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,559
keep black employees

00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,799
how the hell are you going perpetuate

00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,319
equity for a movement that you've

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,640
been mistreating people since you've

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,480
been in existence it's great for you to

00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,520
recognize the awareness and want to do

00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,040
something different

00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,040
i'm not taking that away from you but

00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,880
like uh nakima said earlier we need to

00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,760
see your receipts

00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,720
so i'm curious about what you all felt

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,119
or think

00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,760
about a company's equity statement or

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,000
blm

00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,200
statement or diversity statement what

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,920
what's it like for you when you

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:15,200
experience those

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,200
let's start with the chemo

00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:23,200
um i think about 99

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:27,119
of it is bs and is meaningless

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:30,559
um yeah don't talk about it be about it

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,559
and another thing that

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:37,520
bothered me a lot about the extra

00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:40,720
like yeah the the dialogue

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,400
about black lives matter is that

00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,559
our lives have always mattered and it

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,440
doesn't it shouldn't come to the

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,880
forefront

00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,520
when we're being brutalized and murdered

00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,960
that's why

00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:56,319
like black creativity matters black

00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:59,520
love matters black you know like our

00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,520
we create we

00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:05,680
we are doing amazing things all the time

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:09,040
and to feel like

00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,400
um going into like these interview

00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,680
processes

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,960
and feeling like in some cases

00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,760
this there's definitely a racial bias

00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,880
that i'm up against like if you think

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,520
black lives matter

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:28,000
like hire us hire us

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,960
contract us to do work like when you

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,119
need an artist look for black art like

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,319
pay us because we are in a capital

00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,119
capitalistic

00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:38,880
society and if we're not getting paid

00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,319
we're not surviving

00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,359
so i feel like the economic

00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:49,599
struggle is a slow death and

00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:52,240
it leads to all kinds of other problems

00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,920
you know substance abuse crime mental

00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,079
illness like there are so many things

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,640
that come out of just not having enough

00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,440
to live so if you really believe that

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,799
black lives matter

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,799
make a great effort to hire black people

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,799
and i guess that goes back to the first

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,160
the first question which is like

00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:12,400
where are the black people we're out

00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,680
here so like if you you can't figure it

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,920
out like

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,760
talk to cheryl talk to some people know

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,520
like we're out here

00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,280
there are professionals like there are

00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,240
people who have

00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,920
dedicated a lifetime to this work like

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,520
we didn't just show up on the planet

00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,880
yesterday like

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,200
we're here so i think

00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,040
all of those statements and you know

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,960
we're with you we're listening like

00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,640
i don't need you to listen to hire me

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,319
hire me and pay me

00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,000
pay me what i'm worth pay me what you

00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,119
pay white people

00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,839
so um yeah that's

00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,200
my my take on it is it's it's bs and

00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,839
it's performative

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:55,680
and they could be putting some of that

00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:58,160
effort into hiring us

00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,160
yes and i want to reiterate i'ma lean in

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,119
with the pen

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,079
did you hear when she said pay us what

00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,680
we're worth

00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,119
now you should be paying all human

00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,559
beings of course what they're worth but

00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,960
what the trends show us

00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,559
is you are less likely to pay us what

00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,319
we're worth even as women

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,079
and as black women if you look at how

00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,040
much sense we make on the dollar for a

00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,839
top earner

00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,160
who is usually white in every field we

00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,319
make

00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,319
less and so the world has to do a better

00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:26,160
job of pay equity

00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:28,000
so you hire us and don't think that

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,000
you're doing us a favor by hiring us

00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,119
that is not what she is saying she's

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,960
saying you hiring us

00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,040
because one we have the talent to do the

00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,799
job but you also got to pay us like you

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,359
pay somebody else who you value in that

00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,960
job

00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:41,040
and of course years of experience

00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,839
matters for role i get that

00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,280
but it's not about that i don't uh admin

00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,160
doesn't need to be paid the same as a

00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,480
director

00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,440
but admin should be paid the same as an

00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,680
admin

00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,200
who looks differently than them or

00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,079
director you know what i'm saying that's

00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,000
pay equity

00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,839
and if you do pay equity and you see

00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,319
that you underpay your employees

00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:01,920
you owe them retroactive pay it's not

00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,760
about giving them a bonus that's not

00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,599
what that is it's about giving them an

00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,440
equitable raise

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,280
and because it needs to be consistent

00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,960
with every year so i just wanted to add

00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,559
that spill but angie

00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,760
please tell us more about what what your

00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,480
current thoughts are on

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,680
these statements my current thoughts are

00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,880
are all of that

00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:26,079
all that you you both just said um i'll

00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,520
i'll i'll lean into a bit of my my view

00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,119
on that you know i mentioned a little

00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,839
bit earlier about

00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,880
virtue signaling um nakima just

00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:36,480
mentioned you know

00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:38,799
things being very performative um

00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,920
i agree i think that's a lot of what it

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:43,040
is

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,400
um the ever optimist that i am

00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,240
is that okay maybe the initial intent

00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,520
behind these things are a little

00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:53,040
performative

00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:55,040
but i am hopeful that they do inspire

00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:59,119
actual conversation

00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,160
um whether it's you know a ceo

00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,400
who posted a statement ceo buddy

01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:06,720
sees that his company posted a statement

01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,440
well now they're talking about

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,520
the topic of the statements and and

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,040
maybe that leads into something else

01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:17,440
um but in general the the equity

01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:21,520
statements themselves are not enough

01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:24,640
we see through that right and

01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,359
and you know this is a it's a long

01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,240
process

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,520
and you know we're we're untangling a

01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,480
lot of

01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,760
systemic and structural things we're

01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,880
unpacking biases

01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,240
but you know it's it's one of those

01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,559
things where

01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:44,640
you know um get in there uh and

01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,520
really take a look at where you're

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:50,000
recruiting from it's not a diverse

01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,559
talent issue it's a diverse pipeline

01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,640
issue

01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,640
to reiterate where we where we went

01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,040
before you know once you have people

01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,040
in the door like what are you doing have

01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,079
you done a compensation study

01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,880
across your organization to look at you

01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,520
know

01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,799
objectively what you may be doing maybe

01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,240
not even on purpose

01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:13,040
right but are you are you

01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,680
paying people differently and if so

01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,880
let's fix

01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,520
that right um and then also when it

01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,640
comes to

01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:24,079
new talent coming in the door you know

01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:26,799
something even um i did early in my

01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,359
career was i even undervalued myself

01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,359
just so that i could get in the door

01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:33,359
right and that was my thinking you know

01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:35,760
i look back at that and i kick myself

01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,480
right but if you are bringing in new

01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,640
talent

01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,160
know that some of that might be in play

01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,799
like we might just want to get in the

01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,440
door

01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:45,440
so are we short selling ourselves well

01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,520
maybe but it's your job as

01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,359
as hr or people team or the hiring team

01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,280
or hiring manager looking at something

01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:56,880
to take that into consideration

01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:59,599
and just be fair about it

01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,240
it's it that part's really just not hard

01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,079
just

01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,760
just really think about it and just try

01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:07,760
to be fair

01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:10,319
um and you know it's

01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,799
once you start getting one person in the

01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:14,160
door

01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:16,960
don't start at one you you want more

01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,599
as i mentioned before it gets lonely by

01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,160
yourself

01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,839
and and you know when nikhil was

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,280
speaking earlier about

01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:27,839
um you know kind of the

01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,039
the mental load of just kind of always

01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,880
processing and like

01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,119
having to explain yourself that's the

01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,119
thing too it would be great

01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,880
if i can like walk in and there are less

01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,880
people that i have to explain

01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,400
to the fact of why i'm taking a mental

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,039
day mental health day

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,839
right maybe if there are more people

01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,440
like me

01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:47,440
in the spaces i work i don't have to

01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,640
explain it and that was

01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,000
that's such a relief and and that keeps

01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,039
me around more

01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,160
um so it's as

01:02:55,039 --> 01:03:01,359
as they all said hire hire

01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,559
us once you have us pay us what we

01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:05,599
deserve

01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:07,359
um and create environments where we want

01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,240
to stay

01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:12,079
yeah and and and systems that allow us

01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,280
to stay

01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:19,119
right great great points i think

01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:21,760
this is our last question of the day

01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,559
now that we've talked about equity

01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,400
statements

01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,839
and and we've told you how we feel about

01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,680
when we see those statements

01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:29,359
i want to reiterate the fact that it's

01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,240
not that we don't think that you're not

01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,160
intending

01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,440
to do good things or really putting your

01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,119
best foot forward

01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,799
and also we understand that change

01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,000
doesn't happen overnight

01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:39,599
but we don't want to live by the fact

01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,039
that change doesn't happen overnight

01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,680
because we live in one of the most

01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,720
innovative

01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:47,440
and accessible times of our generation

01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,079
and so we understand that change doesn't

01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,359
happen

01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,799
overnight for many of us or or all of us

01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:56,240
or any of us

01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:58,319
but if you had to think about where your

01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,160
companies needed to change or where

01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,680
you'd like to see change in the

01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,280
professional industry for black

01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,960
professionals happen

01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,119
what are some of the key areas that you

01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,839
think companies should start addressing

01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,559
first

01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:12,079
where should change happen let's start

01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,839
with angie

01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:18,799
um so i think there are some

01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:20,160
really quick easy things that you can do

01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:22,799
um

01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,319
there are professionals in this space

01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:27,200
who

01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,000
consult on diversity equity and

01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,839
inclusion

01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:34,319
who have experience with

01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:36,400
helping organizations develop a strategy

01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:40,240
around that

01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,880
if you can which you know you probably

01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,079
can

01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,640
hire hire someone to consult with you on

01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,240
this

01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,680
there are professionals that exist um

01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,760
don't ask them to consult for free

01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:55,359
though hey them

01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:58,400
um this isn't free or easy work

01:04:55,359 --> 01:05:01,039
right and so um

01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,400
that's step number one step number two

01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,280
is to

01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,280
talk about uh you know take a look

01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,160
around your company what does it look

01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,480
like

01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,520
are there some changes that you you

01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,480
would like to see there

01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,760
and then if the answer to that is yes

01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,680
then talk with your

01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,039
hr department your people team your

01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,680
hiring team

01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,160
and take a look at your process again

01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,240
where

01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,240
are you going looking for your talent

01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:32,559
change it up if you need to um those are

01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,079
just the three quick easy ways i think

01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:38,720
folks can get going

01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:41,920
um and you know start on that journey

01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:44,799
beautiful beautiful nakema

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,480
so yeah i'd like to agree with what

01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:50,000
angie just said

01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:52,319
and um yeah again i

01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,319
am new to corporate world and a

01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:57,440
professional world

01:05:54,319 --> 01:06:00,000
and i think a point

01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,200
that i would add to like hire a

01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,079
professional

01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,920
is actually yeah it's at the same point

01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,119
hire a professional like don't

01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,960
look to me as your black employee

01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,640
to be an expert on diversity and

01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,240
inclusion i that's not

01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:19,200
my lane um i am an expert in my

01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:22,400
experience and i could share that

01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,599
but but hire yeah hire the people who

01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,920
know what they're doing

01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,920
they audit your hiring processes

01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,079
yeah look at where you're recruiting and

01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:35,359
don't

01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,000
expect it to happen organically like you

01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,440
have to

01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,680
take make the effort

01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,200
to find diverse candidates because you

01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,559
don't know how to find them

01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:49,839
so so ask the experts and follow their

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:51,839
recommendations so that you can broaden

01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,599
the diversity of the people who are

01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,240
coming to you because you're pushing

01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,440
them away

01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,839
you don't know what you're doing to do

01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,720
that but you are because if we don't

01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,799
feel like

01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,400
this is going to be a place where we can

01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:06,240
thrive and

01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:08,079
and be safe and healthy we are not going

01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,520
to stay like if we even get in

01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,319
we're not going to stay you're not going

01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:15,599
to retain diverse talent

01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:17,520
so yeah listen to the professionals and

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,359
make an effort you're not going to trip

01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,799
and fall and find

01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,799
yourself in a diverse company

01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,520
and you know we talked about you've

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,079
heard here today about

01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,440
processes for recruitment for retention

01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,520
and for hiring

01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,200
and those are all things that right now

01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,280
in the space where our companies are in

01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,440
and our culture and our climate our pro

01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,200
our interventions right because what

01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,440
we're doing is we're intervening in

01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,359
systems that you have already created

01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,880
so i want you to take the perspective of

01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,599
intervention when you go into your

01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,680
company

01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,640
and think about what systems need you to

01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,240
intervene

01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,240
and what systems do you need to create

01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,880
to intervene processes that have created

01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,559
bias

01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,480
that perpetuate against different

01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,520
identities and or perpetuate

01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,240
discrimination

01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,280
against different identities the other

01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,920
thing i want to talk about

01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,839
is prevention so if you are a company

01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,240
who is in a community think about how

01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:12,480
you can invest in that community to help

01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,280
minimize barriers for people who are or

01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,359
children

01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,880
who are potentially could be talent in

01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,799
your company because remember

01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,560
sustainability is about starting from

01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:22,640
the root and then going to an

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,719
infinite end where it doesn't crash and

01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,560
burn if something goes wrong

01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,560
in order to do that you have to practice

01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,920
social responsibility and really getting

01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,839
invested in communities

01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,679
where we come from and where other

01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,279
marginalized populations come from and

01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,839
finding a way to support them

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,319
whether that is politically whether that

01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:42,080
is just

01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:43,759
economically in your uh community etc

01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,759
because those things really matter

01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,759
because as we undo systems

01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,920
or dismantle systems we need to build

01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,640
new ones to perpetuate some of the

01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,400
equity

01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,640
and equality that we're talking about

01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:56,880
today

01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,400
