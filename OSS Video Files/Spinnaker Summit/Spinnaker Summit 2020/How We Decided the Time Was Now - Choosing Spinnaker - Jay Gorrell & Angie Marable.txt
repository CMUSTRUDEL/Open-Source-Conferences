Description: 
	The old adage “time is money” is more relevant now than it ever was. It’s as competitive within many of our market spaces. So, when that is the case, it’s important to move your products to market & release new features or fixes as fast as you can, while maintaining the integrity and quality of your product. CI/CD creates a way to do this; many of us had other deployment systems that worked just fine when we discovered Spinnaker. What do you do when your current solution isn’t flexible-, reliable-, or fast enough? How do you decide it's time for a major infrastructure change while remaining as un-disruptive to your engineers as possible? Join us as we facilitate a Fireside Chat to discuss just that: The inflection point where organizations made the call to overhaul their CI/CD pipeline and implement Spinnaker as a solution. You’ll hear various perspectives on: What were the pain-points of previous deployment strategies when looking for another solution? What were the concerns surrounding the implementation & rollout of Spinnaker as a solution? What is some key advice for other organizations who are just now starting to look at Spinnaker?
