Description: 
	The extensibility team at Armory has been working on the Spinnaker plugin system for the last year. Most of the work has been driven by example plugins that serve as both documentation and a demonstration of capabilities. Clay explains how to write a plugin by walking the audience through several examples. He also gives an overview of the plugin system and explains the changes being made to Spinnaker in order to make plugins easier to write.
