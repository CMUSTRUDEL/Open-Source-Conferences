Title: Managed Delivery for Kubernetes: A Collaboration Story - Luis Pollo, Rob Hilton, Nima Kaviani
Publication date: 2021-01-12
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	Managed Delivery has come a long way since the 2019 Spinnaker Summit. We've added many features, along with stability, usability and extensibility improvements that make it easier to add support for new kinds of infrastructure resources. Through the Spinnaker-as-Code SIG, AWS and Netflix started a partnership to extend Managed Delivery support via plugins to enable management of Kubernetes resources and the deployment of Docker images into those resources as part of high-level delivery workflows, where a user defines the logical environments and promotion constraints, and Spinnaker takes care of the details. In this talk, we discuss our collaboration, the progress made so far, and exciting opportunities for the future of Kubernetes support in Managed Delivery.
