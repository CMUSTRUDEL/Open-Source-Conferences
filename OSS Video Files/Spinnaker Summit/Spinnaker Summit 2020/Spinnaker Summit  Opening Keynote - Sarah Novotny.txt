00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,600
hello

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,120
and thanks for joining us at spinnaker

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,960
summit

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,160
i want to take a moment just to

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,440
acknowledge

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:20,640
that 2020 is a year like no other

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,840
we've had civil unrest in the us

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,880
we've had a global pandemic we have

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,800
politics being complicated in so many

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,679
places right now

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,360
especially globally and of course

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,440
there's been for many of us

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,680
some amount of shelter in place and

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,800
being disconnected from our communities

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,680
and the people that we care about

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120
so that's really hard and i think you

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,960
should all be commended

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,039
for actually sitting here watching

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
another video

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,559
hopefully it will be exciting and

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,960
interesting for you and you'll be able

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,199
to

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,160
take away something good i know that

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,800
will be the case

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
for many of the other sessions of this

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,199
whole spinnaker summit

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,199
so do stick around

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,080
what i have most found

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:15,119
to be a challenge within 2020 is focus

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,920
focus is really tough for me right now

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,520
we have this huge baseline anxiety we've

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,200
got all the weird stuff of

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,119
no longer going to our offices or i used

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,240
to travel regularly

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,720
the ability for me to sit at home and

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,439
just

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,479
talk to a camera in order to talk to the

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,920
communities that i

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,240
used to go love going out to visit

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
is hard so i think we're all struggling

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,400
with this and this thing baseline

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
anxiety

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
and discomfort and everything being

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,320
changed

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,320
is really leading at least for me to a

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,600
lack of focus and i have a very hard

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,960
time focusing

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,640
so i've been paying attention this year

00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,240
when i've been sitting a lot like this

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,520
and trying to figure out how

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,560
to be able to use the limited time and

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,080
focus i have

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,879
when i get it and be able to still

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,400
do amazing things for work do amazing

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,599
things for my family

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,319
and to do amazing things for myself

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,599
this is tough this is not an easy year

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,840
to do this

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,840
but i've come up with some tips

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,760
let's go ahead and talk about

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,360
building things which are core to your

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,800
business

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,080
it is super straightforward to say that

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,519
but many many people get mired

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,840
in the possibility or challenge

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,800
of building all the things how many

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
people have thought

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
or have heard the phrase not invented

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
here

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,680
probably everyone probably at least

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,480
almost everyone

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
on this uh particular video watching

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,599
today

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,239
most of you have heard not invented here

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
that

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,920
is actually a great risk i think in

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,360
businesses

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,400
and i think it's really tough to

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,879
make sure that you make space to focus

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
on

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,360
the pieces of your business which are

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
core

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,239
there's a lot of wonderful work that

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,560
happens at the edges of technology

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,920
in context for your business this is

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,959
actually how spinnaker

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,000
came about there was no um

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,440
easy way within netflix to go ahead and

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
distribute and deliver their software in

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,920
a meaningful

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
way with all of the different pipeline

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,159
pieces and

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,319
checks and balances that they wanted in

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,760
making sure that the software was

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,799
run or was compiled was tested was run

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,879
was deployed in some sort of manner for

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,440
further testing and then that it really

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,439
was what we expected it to be

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,840
so that was they needed context for

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,519
their business the whole netflix website

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
needed context and needed a way to be

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,239
deployed

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,080
regularly i'm sure all their internal

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,120
tooling did etc

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,599
so that was context and that was open

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
source

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,680
and that was built and delivered as open

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,319
source because it wasn't core

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,920
to netflix's business but now given

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,200
netflix has done a bunch of the heavy

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,079
lifting for you

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,959
and now spinnaker is open source and

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,440
you're able to

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,280
use it why would you try to build your

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,400
own set of deployment scripts or why

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,120
would you continue

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,199
trying to maintain them

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,400
another thing that i have spent a lot of

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
time thinking about

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,440
around businesses and how to make them

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,919
work

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
is that there has to be space to learn

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,120
in a business

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
and that means that there has to be

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,120
space to fail

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:51,759
when we're working in a world that is so

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,600
complicated by the global issues of 2020

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,960
knowing and trusting that your

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,600
team your manager your executives

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,960
understand and expect that there will be

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,759
failures

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,759
is incredibly important there needs to

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,560
be psychological safety

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
in order for people to try things and to

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,800
make use of them

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,680
and then go ahead and ideally and in

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,440
some cases

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,919
not always doing something fantastic

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,840
there's a lot of failure before the

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,919
event

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,919
fantastic but that failure

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,919
is how you learn and grow through this

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,160
so in a time when everyone was is a

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,960
little stuck

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,759
when companies even are a little stuck

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,520
there

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,360
there's healthy tension right now

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,440
between having to change

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
things as rapidly as you can because the

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
world is requiring it

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,880
and wanting to do things just the same

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,240
way you used to

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,960
that's a really tough place for

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,720
businesses to be i've seen a couple of

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,440
places where there's a joke

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,479
that uh that let's see what's how's the

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,000
joke go

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,880
it's so what led to your

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
digital transformation was it executive

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,639
vp

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,160
was it a particular product was it

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,280
something else

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
or was it 2020 and in a lot of cases

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,759
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
is driving a ton of digital

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,560
transformation and that's important

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,600
we all have to work from home we have to

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,000
be able to

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,880
engage differently we have to be able to

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,479
run tools that weren't necessarily built

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,440
to be

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,160
accessed remotely etc so all of this

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,240
work

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,680
all of this change all this impetus for

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,639
change

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
is a challenge at the same time that

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,960
you're having

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,080
a challenge with focus

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,560
that means that

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,479
one has to be really careful about where

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,680
we're spending our energies

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,479
and making sure that you're drawing in

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,000
communities and experts and resources

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,720
that are around you

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
in order to be able to deliver the best

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
possible thing

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,360
right now doesn't have to be you who

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,360
thinks of the smartest thing

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
it's you who gets to pull together all

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,080
the important things

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,520
and then make space for the experiment

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,880
or the new project

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,800
or the innovation that you need that is

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,639
core to your business as opposed to

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,400
writing all of that work

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,440
around that is context for your business

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,599
so i think and i can totally connect to

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,599
this to open source i think

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,680
that open source and open source

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,720
communities are one of the places

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,080
that you can find that support

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:47,840
that guidance that engagement

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:50,319
and be able to work within a community

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,039
on a project spinnaker since where it's

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,199
vinegar so

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,720
let's talk about spinnaker specifically

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,319
on a project

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,960
where you offer feedback you offer

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,039
issues you can see public roadmaps you

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,639
can work within the community to ask and

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,120
answer questions

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
and you can always go ahead and reach

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
out

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,840
i have met many of my best friends

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
through open source

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
reach out and engage with people over

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,800
technical

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,360
things especially when feeling

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,160
fraught or feeling overwhelmed being

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,919
able to have

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
a technical discussion when you have

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,520
those moments of focus

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,440
is super important so being able to do

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,560
that out in the community

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,200
is great the best part though in my

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,519
joining

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,760
armory as an advisor and getting to

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,919
participate more in this community

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
is that it draws me back to one of my

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,399
favorite communities

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,240
so spinnaker of course is a part of the

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,399
devops movement

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,519
and devops community members

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,440
are amazing i was first

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,440
lucky enough to participate in this

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,880
community in

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,399
the early 2010s and

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,680
that was when i was very much learning

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,760
the experience and the excitement and

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,760
the engagement about

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,279
not just continuous delivery but

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,880
continuous learning

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,240
the devops community is a great

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,399
community

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:28,160
that is able to and engaged

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:31,680
with how people operate their businesses

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,000
making sure that those businesses

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:39,040
are safe and healthy and engaged

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,600
even in times that are challenging

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,120
this devops community makes space for

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,320
people to learn

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,000
makes space for people to engage

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,600
and to monitor and

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,480
move toward the positive ideal of a

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,839
service that is available all the time

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,600
we know

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
that services will never be available

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,880
all the time

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,079
but we can continue to work to reduce

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,320
that

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,560
and reduce the outages that happen and

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,079
go ahead and make this the best possible

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,279
service

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:17,200
so many ways to do this devops though

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:20,720
great place to go in and ask questions

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
make sure that that community is always

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,800
excited

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,519
to engage they are happy

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,320
to work with you about your problem

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,480
they're

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,519
within devops and within spinnaker

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,920
specifically

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
there are slack channels there are

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,360
mailing lists

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,560
there are twitter well i guess that's

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,360
there is twitter

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,720
in order for you to ask questions and

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,160
participate

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,360
and you know be part of a community

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,560
in a time when we don't have a lot of

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,440
engagement that is serendipitous

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,760
being able to have a little bit of that

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,640
from a community that can help you

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:06,240
is fantastic the devops community

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,720
and the spinnaker community i hope also

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,079
have a long-standing tradition of paying

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,560
attention to

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,560
chopping wood and carrying water first

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,320
time i heard that phrase at an o'reilly

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,680
velocity conference

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,640
it took me a moment to sit and

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,240
actually recognize what they meant i had

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,040
grown up in a household that

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,000
in fact fueled their fueled their

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,200
furnace with wood

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,040
so i was a little bit stymied and then i

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
understood it at the time

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
as the time went on i was able to

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,240
understand

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
that this is really about doing the

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,640
unglamorous work

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,519
of a project or within a community or

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,320
within your company but making sure that

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,519
that

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,800
work is done and that that work is done

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,399
just as well and just as

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,560
evenly across the group as it can be

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,600
so everyone is expected to chop wood and

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
carry water

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
it's not exciting it's not the thing

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,279
that is going to get you

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,800
on the front page of the wall street

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,160
journal but it is

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,440
incredibly important to good

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,800
solid companies and projects and

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,200
products living and working and

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,600
being able to satisfy customer and user

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
needs

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,800
i touched a moment ago on wanting to

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,000
reward behaviors

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,399
that you want to see and especially

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,920
around

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:37,200
learning and failure and making sure

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,160
that your teams

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,680
your companies feel as if there is space

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
to experiment

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,800
even with all this uncertainty is going

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,519
to take away some of their discomfort

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,560
is going to be able to make the

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,680
individual feel safer at work and more

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,279
comfortable

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,399
and again in a year where so much is

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,279
unknown

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,320
that's a huge help and goes ahead and

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,000
draws us back to

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
potentially having a little more space

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,440
for focus

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,839
whether that focus is on work or is on

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,760
your family or is on your side project

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,639
you still have a little more space for

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,800
it if you feel safe

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,079
the last thing i want to touch on is

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,279
making sure that people

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,959
share it is

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,760
one of the hardest things to

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,399
look at when you see a company that has

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,399
built everything from scratch themselves

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,440
first off every time the company

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,880
changes uh it gets a new hire

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,839
that person has to be trained from

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,079
scratch there is no

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,320
knowledge that is brought in with them

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,519
if if they're working only with custom

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,680
software

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,160
so making space for your employees to

00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,600
share

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
the work that they're doing whether it's

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,399
a story as a case study

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
or participating in a community in order

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,199
to

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:12,959
work on issues or help with road maps or

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,199
engage you know with different projects

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,000
open source projects that you use within

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,000
your

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,519
company that sharing is the beginning

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,760
of building a punch holders

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,760
of the giants who have gone before us

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,440
and in this case it would be your team

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,760
members your employees

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
being the giants of the next generation

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,000
by participating

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,839
and by engaging with these open source

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,560
projects

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
so a couple of things need to be thought

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,360
through on this

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,320
make sure that you're taking care of

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,199
yourself and your family

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,079
and your team and all the work that you

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,760
need to be done

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,120
but do remember that if you're not

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,160
taking care of you

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,079
you won't be able to do anything else

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,920
so make sure you're sharing you're

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,680
participating you're engaging with the

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,680
community

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,399
and please please come participate in

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,440
spinnaker

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
come try it understand that it takes a

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,839
bit

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,720
to see the benefits i heard a statistic

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,839
the other day that was it takes eight

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,320
different

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,680
deployment pipelines before there's a

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,440
tipping point

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,079
that suddenly the value of the

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,360
uh the value of spinnaker becomes much

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,560
more obvious

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,839
and much more available

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,000
and and interesting to enterprises

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,240
so give it some practice take a look at

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,160
it see how it might help

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,959
and as you become more familiar with

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
spinnaker you can go ahead and see how

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,040
it can make

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,000
an impact on your company and

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,240
how your work is going to happen take

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,440
care of yourselves in 2020 folks

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
this is not this is not an easy year and

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
it

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,160
is not a year that um

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,160
we hope will ever repeat even by march

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,000
we were hearing the phrase unprecedented

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,720
and if the year has only gotten more

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
complicated so take care of yourselves

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,160
enjoy the rest of

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,519
the event and make sure

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,959
that as you are watching these

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,759
videos that you are going ahead learning

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,279
things

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,560
sharing them and seeing if there is a

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,880
way that you can

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,680
grow and help others grow in this

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,199
industry

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,360
even as you're trying to ration the

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,320
minimal focus you may have right now

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,440
because of

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,959
