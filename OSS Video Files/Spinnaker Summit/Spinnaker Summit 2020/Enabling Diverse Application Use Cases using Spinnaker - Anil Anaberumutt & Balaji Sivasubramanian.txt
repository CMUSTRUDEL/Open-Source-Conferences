Description: 
	Cisco's Spinnaker Success Story!

Cisco adopted Spinnaker a couple of years ago and has onboarded more than 1000+ applications. Initially, Cisco started off deploying traditional cloud-native container-based applications to on-prem cloud platforms (OpenShift) and then to public cloud (AWS, GCP). Now Cisco is extending to other technology platforms using custom deployments models available in Spinnaker. Cisco is successfully deploying to Snowflake (SaaS data warehouse), Teradata, and Informatica (Data Analytics platforms) and planning to extend to other use cases in the future. In this session, you will learn about considerations for using Spinnaker for non-cloud platform workloads and best practices and learning from these migrations.
