Title: Keynote Panel: Straight Talk from Technology Leaders on Spinnaker & the SDLC
Publication date: 2021-01-12
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	Doing DevOps at scale has inherent challenges. Every organization will face those challenges with different contexts and constraints. This fun and casual fireside Q&A panel with Armory CTO Isaac Mosquera will dig into the experiences and observations of technology leaders from innovative companies. Get to know these leaders, and find out about the biggest challenges they have faced in optimizing SDLCs, and how they strategize to address them with Spinnaker and beyond. Live audience Q&A will give attendees the opportunity to be part of the conversation.

that is particularly strong in europe

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,520
and it's getting

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
stronger in africa and some parts of

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,680
patreon

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,720
patreon is a a platform uh

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,599

paid uh and my team is really

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,920
responsible for all of the

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,319
the technical underpinning of patreon

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,280
engineering so all of the infrastructure

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,720
and also core and shared services uh are

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,519
driven by my team

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,959
okay thanks a lot otno and uh for those

00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
who don't know me my name is isaac

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
mascara i

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,680
am the cto at armory we provide

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,040
an enterprise version of spinnaker we've

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,120
been in the community for

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
uh over four years and it's been amazing

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
to watch it grow

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,720
and one of the best things about this

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,360
job is being able to

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,000
interact with folks with like you all

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,840
whether

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
you know your customers or not you're

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
part of the community and i think that's

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,080
one of the things that i keep coming

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,319
back for so it's

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
it's a it's a huge opportunity for me to

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,400
be able to interact with you guys so

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,280
thank you

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
for your time today uh it's this is this

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,280
is awesome

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,959
um so you know one of the things that i

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,000
think i run into a lot

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,159
is really why not just continue

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,680
to use the existing tooling that

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,920
everyone's used before like

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,599
why did you all move to spinnaker what

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,720
was the impetus to moving to something

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,480
like spinnaker

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,799
what made you change from what you were

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,280
doing before uh and then also

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
uh why not continue to invest and make

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,239
what you had

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,519
before better versus switching to a new

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,560
tool altogether

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,680
so uh otieno why don't we start with you

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,239
really i think the the the benefit uh

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
for us

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,720
uh in moving to spinnaker is that we can

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,720
kind of move everyone up the stack

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,560
right so rather than having engineers

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,160
being very focused on the ins and outs

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,840
of our cloud platform

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,759
uh we're able to tie together

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,680
different technologies that we use so we

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,800
can tie together aws

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,880
and terraform uh and our

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,320
configuration management system and

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,680
really have spinnaker

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,040
drive all of that together uh

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,160
it centralizes how we think about

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,880
uh shipping

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
our software how we think about um

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,960
deploying

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,840
so we're no longer focused on uh each

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
individual piece

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
but just the pieces that uh don't work

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,199
uh

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,880
or or that break that that fail uh

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,120
and that's just a better place for my

00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,360
team to be focused really the drive for

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,280
us

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,360
early on was just the number of people

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,639
that we had we had very few engineers

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,840
and we didn't have the ability for to be

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,639
focused very deeply and make sure that

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,960
uh you know

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,720
uh our configuration management system

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
was doing uh the right thing every

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,160
single time we needed a system that

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,280
would bring that information to us

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,240
rather than having us go find it and

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
spinnaker has been

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
a very good tool for us in that regard

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,479
that's great thank you bridget what was

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
it for for you and the xero team

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
that made you want to move over to

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
spinnaker or even really what made you

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
consider

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,639
a new tool instead of using what you had

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,960
before

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
yeah totally um so we've been we've been

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
around for a while and we

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
kind of got to the point a couple of

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
years ago where we had i think just

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,560
about every free and open source version

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,160
of build and deployment tooling running

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,680
in the company and

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
i have a very small team and it was

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
taking a massive amount of time

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
just to support the things that we

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
currently had let alone

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,479
helping people build new and innovative

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
stuff so

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,160
we kind of started looking around and

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,280
being like as we went through our

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
platformers product

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,479
transition and started thinking about

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
how we built compelling

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,199
internal products we started looking at

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,080
like key technologies we could use to

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,039
underpin those

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,080
and so we started moving to kubernetes

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,479
so we could remove

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,000
a lot of the complexity around aws from

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
our developers

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,680
and so when we started looking at build

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,600
and deployment tooling spinnaker was a

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
really natural fit for us because of all

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
the work that's already been done

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,360
in the community and i really like with

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
a small team it's really nice to stand

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
on the shoulders of giants

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
and not have to reinvent the wheel from

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,840
scratch we can kind of take

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,600
the really awesome stuff that's being

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,720
done by other people and just leverage

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,880
that

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
it's a really nice way of making my very

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,280
very small engineering team go

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,280
much further

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,440
that's that's great how about you

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,800
michael and uh pinterest what was it

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,120
about

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,440
your existing or your older system that

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,639
made you want to move off

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,680
i think it's definitely important to

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,240
acknowledge that a company of our size

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,599
has obviously built multiple sets of

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,199
tools if not one

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,639
over the course of its period to kind of

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,520
do ci cd

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,000
and part of like a large motivation for

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,960
us

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,680
was to obviously look to consolidate and

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,919
reduce that fragmentation so that's key

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,360
uh so that you don't have these pockets

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
of areas where

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
uh where engineers are spending a lot

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,919
more time on managing

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
the scripts and the tools they've

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,960
written and try to centralize a lot of

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,479
that function into a single place

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,599
and and the others also mentioned this

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,000
clearly having

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,240
really small and lean teams it's

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,400
important for us to consider

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,440
how we can provide one single solution

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,599
which can cater to

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,199
at least 80 of those different use cases

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,039
and we can reduce the

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,160
toil and the overhead our developers

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,520
feel in terms of doing basic ci cd um so

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
at least in that form

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,039
i think spinnaker has definitely been a

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,440
transformational tool

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,199
uh at pinterest and like isaac you

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,199
mentioned we did speak about this last

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,680
year at spinnaker summit as to how truly

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,240
it helps us transform from doing like

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,560
one or two deploys a day to almost 15 to

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
20 deploys a day for some of the largest

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
services in the company

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,160
and that has just helped a lot of

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,479
confidence for others to like adopt uh

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,479
give up their uh particular scripts and

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
start moving to the standardized tool of

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,840
doing things

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,199
it definitely reduces a lot of the

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,599
friction it improves

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,880
our developer productivity overall and

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,399
you know we could just focus on

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
investing in one system rather than

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
different

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,000
things to do yeah

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,480
yeah i definitely remember that graphing

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,959
chart you uh showed on stage last year

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
was

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,880
super impressive i i really really liked

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,640
your top there and

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,160
showed the power of spinnaker and how

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,720
much it can help teams improve with

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,480
their velocity and security and safety

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
so that was that was awesome how about

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,839
you john what was

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
uh you know what was it about your old

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,959
tooling that made you want to consider

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,600
new tooling

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,160
yeah so basically the the system and the

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
process that we had it was

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
made when when global was about 10 20

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
people

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,080
as we scaled the organization the amount

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,279
of time

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,399
that we spent on on deployment it just

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
increased too much

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,680
it was unbearable so we started looking

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,760
at

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,200
first what was the complexity of

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,600
building it ourselves

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
that was you know with a really small

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
platform team

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,640
like we had of six people that that was

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,640
not an option

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
and we started looking at different

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,440
alternatives

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:45,680
and spinnaker just crossed like all

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,160
check boxes so the integrations with our

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,720
current stack integration with jenkins

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,920
and aws made the transition

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,760
extremely smooth and we went from maybe

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,800
four deployments a week

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,480
to more than than 10 per day which

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,959
for us it's a big success yeah

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,839
but also super impressive i've seen i've

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,560
seen these uh

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,440
changes in a lot of organizations that

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,200
that adopt

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,959
spinnaker and it's it's just impressive

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,320
to watch the improvements there

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,240
you know one of the things that uh was a

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,600
a theme that came out of everything that

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,240
you guys responded with

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
was really around um consolidation of

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,200
tooling

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
making sure that these small teams don't

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
have to kind of reinvent the wheel

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,760
and you know one of the challenges that

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,000
i've seen with implementing spinner at

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,640
these

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,160
organizations it's not the technological

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,959
challenge but in fact actually

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,160
the social challenge you know what were

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,360
some of the social

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,279
challenges that you were facing in your

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
organizations to get them to adopt a

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,959
tool like spinnaker

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
and then how did you overcome those uh

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,160
and michael i see you shaking your head

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,519
there why don't you go ahead and kick it

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,800
off

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,200
um sure i think um

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
i think uh like you like to your point

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,720
when there is a

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,000
fragmentation of tooling to do certain

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,160
things uh

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,240
and trying to get buy-in uh it's

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,839
important that we try to get everyone on

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,920
the same page and show the value

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,279
of the of the system or the product

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,640
we're trying to propose

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,680
and the key the key thing which really

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,560
worked for us

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,640
is uh you know focus on one thing and

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,160
really do a good job with that

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,399
um and that was really what helped us

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,480
kind of show the true value of spinnaker

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,160
uh where we decided to tackle

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,600
like one of the most complicated

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,200
problems in the company

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,959
there are over 200 engineers committing

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,800
code to our api and the

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,480
uh the web service which is the two

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,440
largest monolithic systems at the

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
company

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,399
and and they really expressed pain point

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,399
from a solutions perspective and not

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,000
really from a problem perspective

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,600
so what really worked for us is like

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,639
when we started like talking to them and

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,040
trying to understand what the pain point

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,560
was we distilled it down to three things

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,279
one is people uh there's definitely a

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
perception

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,560
of how slow things are so we want to

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,040
help improve that

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,800
two there's definitely questions about

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,160
like how to use certain tools and what

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,480
is the recommended way of doing things

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,240
so there's a best practices part

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,000
and and three um there was clearly some

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,600
reliability concerns where people would

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,880
often have to come back

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,480
when they shipped their commits or

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,079
something to see you know whether that

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,160
made it to production or not

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,600
uh so there's definitely like um the

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,360
visibility part of it

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,920
the reliability part of it and more

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,760
importantly this the velocity piece

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,519
so we really distilled down to like you

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,399
know key single metrics which people

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,360
could really grok

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
and associate with and then literally do

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,920
a prototype

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,839
like quick hands-on prototype where we

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,639
started taking on the manual work of

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,120
deploying

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,800
and started automating piece by piece

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,240
and you know you always go through

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,920
consistent feedback loops with your

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,160
customers to make sure that they see the

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,720
value

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,720
and and that is how we really were able

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,839
to kind of convince a larger engineering

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
population

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,399
that this tool uh really works for them

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,839
and you know the more and more

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,160
you basically remove toil from the

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,120
day-to-day uh

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,000
um and keep echoing how we're focused on

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,360
velocity

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,760
um the reliability and and basic

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,360
uh safety of your deployments uh you

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,040
know it's very easy to kind of get that

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,959
buy-in and then expand since there so

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,040
once we've proved a point with one

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,480
of those largest systems it is much

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,079
easier to kind of get

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,240
the other service owners to kind of buy

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,680
into this new model of

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,920
software delivery so yes it is not

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,800
easy it is very painful there's a lot of

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,320
challenges

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
i'm sure everyone else over here also

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,160
has stories to share

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,720
but honestly i think when you look back

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,000
it is one of the more transformational

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,079
problems we ended up solving at

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,320
pinterest

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,320
how many uh percentage-wise of the

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,079
engineers at pinterest are now

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,399
using spinnaker to deploy so

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,360
uh i think we don't look at it in terms

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,079
of the number of

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,440
people using it we do look at the uh

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,600
scope the services

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,440
using it for example when i say the web

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
and the api service there are two

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,120
services but there are monoliths where

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,040
we have like over 200

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,639
300 people committing code their

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,079
services and

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,079
they're never going to go and click the

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,760
deploy button so we ended up building

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,760
processes around it where a lot of this

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
gets automated and whenever there's

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,079
someone's commit which is breaking a

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,839
change

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,440
or or you know like really inhibiting

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,000
someone to get to production

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,760
we have enough policies and processes in

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,680
place where that person gets nothing so

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,440
we're truly automated deployments

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,120
and we also invested in kind of like a

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,199
small release services team to help

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,000
orchestrate a lot of this as well

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,839
um so i think that is one of the key

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,320
ways where you know if you remove

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,920
individuals going and clicking buttons

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,560
that really helped us get that adoption

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,120
and since

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,199
then a lot of the other service owners

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,040
who are much smaller in size

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,560
but definitely have these focused you

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,600
know problems they solve for like the

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,680
core services or

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,839
ads infrastructure now they're the next

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,680
ones who are the next wave of onboarding

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,760
uh uh um customers for for spinnaker

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,600
so i would say at this moment like we

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,519
have really on board some of the top

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
20 services in the company which are you

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,040
know like production grade which have a

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,040
strong impact on the business

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,560
all the way from ads infrastructure to

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,480
your core services

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,600
and now we're like looking at the long

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
tail where we're trying to make it

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
generalized generally available

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,880
so that people can just go ahead and

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,560
start using it uh without like

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,800
uh trying to learn a lot about the tool

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,120
itself

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,199
awesome thanks how about you otieno uh

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,800
what were some of the social challenges

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,720
that you had to get people on boarded

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,480
uh our social challenges were slightly

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,639
different because we were coming from a

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,839
kind of a situation where there wasn't

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,759
uh very much where we had problems that

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,519
we knew spinnaker could solve

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,320
um but also kind of a low floor uh

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,519
you know the problems we were solving uh

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,279
we had to

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,800
they had to be addressed so it was

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,399
spinnaker or or

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
the problems that we were currently

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,800
facing um

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,480
so it's really been a a i think a

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,839
journey of just making sure that

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,279
the value the value we anticipated uh

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,480
is realized um uh

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,519
and maybe uh one of the best things

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,839
about spinnaker is that it's

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,399
relatively uh it sees low use

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,360
outside of engineering in terms of folks

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,040
in the ui

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,120
really what happens is it lets us uh

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,160
release more often as a couple folks

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,360
already said

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,959
um but we do it without really having to

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
think a lot about spinnaker a lot of the

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,440
software engineers who are pushing

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,959
uh code to production just sort of see

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,279
it happen seamlessly

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,839
uh the win for us is that when we need

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,079
to go in and make changes and understand

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,279
what failed understand the touch points

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,000
with different

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,320
parts of the pipeline uh spinnaker is

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,680
the

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,079
sort of one place that that happens um

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,839
so there weren't really there wasn't

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,120
really again much pushback

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,400
there weren't really social uh concerns

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,319
to overcome

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,760
uh it was because it was very blue sky

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,439
uh it was really just hey look what

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,679
spinnaker can do now oh look what it's

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,039
doing now this is amazing

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,839
uh yeah the process for us was it was

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,919
easy

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,400
i can imagine in a larger environment

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,760
with more uh

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,919
with more well-established traditions

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,360
that it was harder but we were really we

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,600
did not have to labor with

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,679
with those uh with legacy in mind

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,280
essentially

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,919
cool thank you how about you bridgette

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,559
yeah so with us the thing that i've kind

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,799
of seen

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,960
most interesting has been we've had this

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,240
kind of culture of learned distrust

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,880
of tooling and so not surprisingly when

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,640
you have

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
a bunch of different tools built by a

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
bunch of different groups

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,440
and implemented slightly differently we

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,039
had this really interesting culture

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,600
where people just didn't trust

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,120
things and so that's kind of been the

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,720
biggest journey that we've gone on with

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
moving people to spinnaker is

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,240
like at the start they really don't

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,679
trust what you're giving them

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,520
and you have to we did a lot of

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,840
hand-holding with our early teams being

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,360
like

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,679
we'll sit with you and we'll like show

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,200
you how it works and we'll be there

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,600
and we'll answer any questions that you

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,280
might have while you kind of get over

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,960
that trust hurdle

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,320
and we kind of work with those teams and

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,760
then after a couple of weeks they don't

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,200
come and talk to us at all because they

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
trust that it's going to work and they

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,520
trust like

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,919
they trust that the things will do the

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,600
things they say that they're going to do

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,600
um but that's been really interesting

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,000
internally like we we had a lot of kind

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,320
of pushback early on from people who

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
were not convinced about full automation

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,600
in their pipelines because they didn't

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
trust that we could build tooling that

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,080
was good enough to do that

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,280
so a lot of people were like just how

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,400
how do you think this is going to work

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,039
and how is this even going to be

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,559
possible

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,480
and like we're going to have to have

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,559
someone on standby from our team to make

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,400
sure that this works and

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,160
watching people overcome that trust has

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,720
been fascinating

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,360
it's really really cool to see all right

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,200
thank you

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,400
how about you john yeah i would say

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,520
um for us one of the big challenges that

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,400
we faced

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,679
well first of all it was that our our

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,480
old process was

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,640
really manual and as they mentioned we

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,080
tried to automate

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,200
each of the steps one at a time to still

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,960
provide value while

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
we were transforming how we were

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,520
deploying

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,640
and the other thing like people got used

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,160
to you know this is low pace

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,360
deployments so they were

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,120
used to merge and and and then

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
until the next day that code is not in

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,280
production so i can test in my

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
staging environment i'm not going to add

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,080
that many tests and

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,799
maybe not that many feature flags so you

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
know

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,480
making this match plus deploy as an

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,440
atomic operation

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,799
was something that um was hard to put

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
into everyone

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,520
mind let's say and it was hard to put

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,760
put it across the whole organization

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,600
because people were still relying a lot

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,640
on those manual steps

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,480
but honestly like right now if we see

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,720
like the results

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,960
nobody thinks about going back to manual

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,559
process and we have also

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,679
seen increased in test creation and

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,919
future flux

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,480
usage it has increased a lot together

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,080
with this effort

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,080
yeah that's awesome my next question was

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,039
going to be what kind of behaviors have

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,840
you seen change

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,200
like you were saying around uh increased

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,799
test coverage and

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
developers are able to kind of focus on

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,840
other parts but you know one of the

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,360
things that i've realized in this

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,640
conversation we've been talking a lot

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,720
about the

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,080
positives of spinnaker and it seems like

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,280
it's just kind of like rainbows and

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,520
apple pie

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,320
um i know it's not a completely like

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,240
that

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,760
and uh you know what i want to hear from

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,039
you all and i think for the viewers

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,159
before they dive into something like

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,960
spinnaker like

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,240
what are the technical challenges of

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,200
spinnaker and bridget you were talking

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
about trust

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,600
uh have there been a time that as you

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,039
were trying to scale out spinnaker or do

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,039
something with spinnaker

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,640
that you just found like technically

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,919
just completely challenging away from

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,919
the social behaviors

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,679
that you kind of like inadvertently kind

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,600
of went back to breaking trust

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,200
reggie you wanna you have a kind of a

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,320
story in mind or kind of areas of

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,159
spinnaker that are just

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,840
just tough to deal with what's the real

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,080
deal here

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
um i was gonna say we've been really

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
lucky we've

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,320
been working with armory basically all

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,080
year and so

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,320
i've been really lucky anytime anything

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,720
like that came up yeah shameless plug

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,000
um anything like anytime anything like

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,200
that kind of came up we were really

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,200
lucky to have them to lean on i guess

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,919
the kind of challenge that we had kind

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,919
of struggled with a little bit is

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,159
building out we've got a few custom

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,720
integrations and we started looking at

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,520
building out custom plugins and

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,039
my team found that quite challenging as

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,039
a piece of work just because it was

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,039
quite new in the process and things are

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,799
changing in the community and so

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,600
hard to get a read on where things are

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,360
kind of at any at any given time

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,080
i'm coupled with the fact i guess that

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,240
my team aren't java developers and so

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,360
i very annoyingly ask them to almost

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,919
learn another language

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,679
in order to be able to do that and i

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,120
think it's kind of beneficial but

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,720
yeah being not a java development team

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,039
we kind of struggled with some of that

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,520
like back end configuration and

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,520
making those changes all right michael

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,720
you're you're not an armory customer yet

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,159
why don't you talk about some of the

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,600
technical challenges that you've been

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,080
facing

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,039
for sure uh let me just say that

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
spinnaker is

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,880
not a simple system to adopt

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,679
uh it is a lot a lot of work and i

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,960
really appreciate

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,039
i think the armory folks really trying

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
to cycle that problem uh i think when we

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,520
kicked this off we were not privy to a

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,880
lot of that external

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,600
vendor availability so some of the

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,200
challenges we had to solve head-on was

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,640
you know basic authentication and

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
authorization right you always start

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,840
with that

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,000
and the interesting thing is pinterest

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,679
has adopted envoys and ingress like an

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,520
authentication authorization ingress for

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,679
all our tools and systems

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,280
um and you know we looked at how to

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,880
integrate with that effectively

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,720
um so that was just like one of the

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,159
first ones we were trying to solve

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,000
and eventually i think as we started

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,159
using more and more spinnaker a couple

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,159
of things we definitely encountered was

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,080
uh you know managing execution history

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,919
state like just uh

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,159
right now everything's written to redis

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,200
uh uh well not the history per se but

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,320
the execution

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,840
uh happenings and there was a very

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,360
interesting incident i was like the

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,080
instant runner for that where we ran out

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,200
of redis

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,559
uh spa um uh space and

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
all of a sudden spinnaker started

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,440
throwing errors and we didn't know why

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,640
and what happened

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
because the areas were obviously not

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,960
obvious but then it took us like about

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,480
a couple of uh probably an hour or so

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,919
just to kind of figure out that we ran

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,320
out of space on redis and we had to

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,080
expand that whole cluster or double that

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,679
up so that we can run spinnaker

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,279
effectively which all the more shows

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,200
that we need to have proper telemetry

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,720
into the system so

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,400
challenges with pinterest was definitely

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,840
authorization authentication because we

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
have to get it hooked up to our internal

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,320
systems

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,679
telemetry uh you know trying to

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,520
integrate that with you know the

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,679
solutions we have internally because

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,720
we're not a prometheus shop or something

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,200
um

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,799
uh just understanding these nuances of

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,400
you know how to operate these micro

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,240
services in spinnaker because we have

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,799
our own kubernetes infrastructure

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,720
so we actually deploy to kubernetes so

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,320
we had to figure out how to like also

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,559
adopt some of the uh

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,840
custom crds we had written ourselves

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,440
because we want to make kubernetes

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,240
simple within our company

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,039
uh i think i can keep going on this list

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,960
it's a con

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:46,080
endless list i will say yeah

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,799
i will say that uh i think some context

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,559
behind this

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,400
is the reason we had to do a lot of that

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,080
is one you know improve our operational

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,559
rigor on how we operate such a critical

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
system

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,039
right now is a tier zero system in our

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,640
company because if that fails right now

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,720
the other way fallback way of doing any

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,720
sort of deployments or fixing

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,640
any bugs on production would be to use

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,320
our you know

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,480
legacy deployment system which is still

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,520
there the vm based deployment system

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,080
um so operation rigger

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,679
second is actually the ease of use was

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,039
also critical like when people started

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,360
when we started exposing the user

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,679
interface to multiple folks

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,919
we had a lot of feedback and pushback

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,679
about things on how to use it as well

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,120
so we had to work with them to like

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,640
integrate that with the pinterest

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
infrastructure ecosystem

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,240
like okay how do you talk to the ec2

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,720
deployment system you already have

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,480
and not try to like you know move you

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,360
from one ui to another

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,640
um and so yeah operation rigor the ease

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,080
of use and integration with the

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,840
pinterest ecosystem

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:48,159
and i think finally uh you know

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,440
just understanding how spinnaker works

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,559
like i think we got a lot of help from

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,799
the community

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,600
but these you know incidents we ran into

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,760
with redis

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,039
or we are now looking to migrate to

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,039
using mysql for

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,960
storing histories we're exploring how to

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,320
like have pipelines stored as code

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,000
using using backups there's a lot of

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,520
operational challenges over there

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,440
so in in hindsight i think

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,279
probably the time we invested in making

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,360
it robust

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,039
uh we could have definitely leveraged

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,000
you know some some

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,440
solution which would have already

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,799
existed so we could have focused more on

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,200
the user experience portion of thing

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,799
which

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,039
in my opinion is like much higher value

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,720
for users

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,559
but but that's where things are right

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,200
now okay

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,120
thanks uh john what kind of technical

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,320
challenges have you faced

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:40,159
yeah so as bridget mentioned we are

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,520
armory customers so not that many

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,400
challenges operating spinnaker itself

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,000
so right now what we are struggling with

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,840
is to find time to

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,400
let's like use the full potential of

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,000
spinnaker

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,919
and leverage that to our transition to

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,960
microservices for example

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,720
working on on dingy files and having

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,520
modules that abstract some of the

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,600
complexity

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,640
for the teams this is something that we

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,679
need to start

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,120
working on or working on open policy

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,080
agent um

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,520
that the armory also provides uh to put

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,640
some checks in place

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,440
so as i mentioned

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,440
there's not like technical challenges

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,120
operating it it's more like

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,120
how can we take um advantage of using

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,880
spinnaker and armory spinnaker in this

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,640
case and expand this to the whole

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,039
organization cool and uh

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,240
back to you tiano any technical

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,919
challenges that you guys have been

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,640
facing

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,240
sure so uh we started out with some uh

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,960
some of the the more basic

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,720
uh uh issues like michael mentioned just

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,159
like authentication how do we make that

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,120
work in our environment

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,600
um but we really rapidly i think moved

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,120
to

00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:00,159
uh trying to make the

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,279
the codex pipeline uh the code pipeline

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,640
work for us

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,120
um and i think that's where we've had a

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,880
lot of where we've had some issues

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,679
and it's really just integration it's

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,799
really making spinnaker do more

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,399
um uh making

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,799
sort of tying it into our process so

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,399
that we can have you know a multi-stage

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,399
deployment process

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,000
um it's taking some of the things that

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,360
we've automated in other ways as other

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
folks have mentioned

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,720
and then pushing that into into

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,080
spinnaker and um

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,000
you know with the help of folks from

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,520
armory it hasn't been

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,440
there haven't been huge technical

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,120
problems but it has been a process of

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,360
just

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,320
uh you know picking a uh you know a

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,520
target and then

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,480
uh hitting that target uh in terms of uh

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,880
deploying

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,039
new workflows all right well thank you

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,399
so uh you know michael one of the things

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,600
that you mentioned was

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,520
kind of being able to focus on ux and

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,440
i noticed something unique in bridget's

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,240
title versus everybody else's title

00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,919
which is

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,320
you have bridget you have the product

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,399
owner title and that is something and

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,600
you work in the engineering department i

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,559
imagine

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,480
yeah yeah yeah and i've noticed that the

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,360
product there's a product owner title

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,279
showing up

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,360
more so in the engineering or the

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,200
centralized engineering departments

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,399
and i just thought that there was

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,080
something going on what do you think is

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,679
going on here why do you think

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,320
there's more people with the product

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:28,000
owner title

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,200
yeah um i think it's really interesting

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,760
we kind of apply product origin to how

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,120
we build

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,880
customer facing projects but i think

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,480
technology teams and engineering

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,159
departments are kind of going through a

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,399
transformation of recognizing

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,320
that there's a lot of value to be gained

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,080
from doing that internally

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,919
and so rather than just having like a

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,600
services team that just responds to

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,279
requests and kind of does their own

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,960
thing in the background

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,039
starting to look at how we build really

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,000
compelling experiences for our internal

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,240
developers and

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,840
really valuing that internal developer

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,520
experience because

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
the faster and more efficient we can

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,480
make our teams that are building

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,159
customer facing features the better for

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
the business overall

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,840
so it's definitely something we're kind

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,200
of seeing across the industry as well

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,880
there's the last couple of years has

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,600
been a lot more writing about

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,200
platform as a product and kind of

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,399
starting to push towards that it's

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,919
really interesting it's a really

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,080
exciting space to be in doing product

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,520
yeah it absolutely is and i can see you

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,320
know it's really interesting from

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,960
me interacting with customers i can see

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,600
where

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
there's a true passion for the customers

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,760
and the

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,919
developer experience versus this

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,600
thing kind of being forced on them and

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,640
it's a it's a really kind of night and

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,279
day experience

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,640
um and in terms of kind of listening to

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,240
your customer and making sure you

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,279
understand what they're going through

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,440
michael how does that kind of uh work at

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,200
pinterest for you guys is spinnaker

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,159
forced onto the engineers or do they

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,399
have a choice to

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,080
onboard or not so right now uh

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,600
we strongly believe in the concept of

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,279
incentive based on boarding

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,960
especially my team who's sort of the

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,720
central team to

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,320
effectively inspire every developer to

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,840
do their best work that's sort of our

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,159
vision statement

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,600
so we really incentivize users to use

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,799
our tools rather than try to force

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,799
something on them

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,799
uh i would argue that yes we do have

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,960
some monopoly on certain tools

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,399
uh like source code management or the

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,120
build infrastructure

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,320
however i don't want to echo i think

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,360
what bridget mentioned

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,640
is that there's definitely a transition

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,799
in in in such companies where there is

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,720
heavy focus being put on and developer

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,279
experience and productivity right

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,000
we've had those teams in the past uh but

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,679
now

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
you know the value you could unlock by

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,039
having a more cohesive experience

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,039
internally uh is way more

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,960
than how things used to be say you know

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,480
six seven years ago because there's so

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,000
many different sas products out there

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,799
people are used to so many different

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,600
tools

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,000
they expect that high level or high bar

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,320
in terms

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
of use usability and you cannot be

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,320
providing like

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,919
you know i don't know cli clients which

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,840
again people are okay with but

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,039
probably like 10 years ago what worked

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,720
in terms of these arbitrary

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,320
configuration files is not going to work

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,519
anymore because folks want to really get

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,600
their job done

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,720
uh you know they don't want to focus and

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,840
and really spend a lot of time

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,279
understanding infrastructure

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,399
and to be honest like with spinnaker

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,120
that's one of the feedback we did

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,480
receive

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,159
because it introduced so many different

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,960
new terminology and people were trying

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,159
to like

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,960
understand that the same thing with

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,159
kubernetes as well and we realized that

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,080
if you're an engineer

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,080
trying to you know ship your next ads

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,880
feature out or or build that next

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,200
big product feature those are like some

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,120
of

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,880
the concerns you should never be having

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,440
uh and and they expect

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,960
that high high expectation of like just

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,080
tools working together

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,240
so um our team in fact like

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,600
so i do dawn two hats i play both the

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,399
engineering manager and the product

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,320
manager

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,600
and we are actually as pinterest now

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,679
investing into

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,880
uh you know the platform as a product uh

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,720
uh concept

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,320
uh and and we're trying to like get

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,399
product managers involved in solving

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,799
these cross-functional problem spaces

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,240
you know developer productivity or uh

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,120
like what is that platform as a service

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,519
look like

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,120
uh um so i think it's uh

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,880
spinnaker aside i think a lot of these

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,640
developer tools need to come together to

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,120
provide that holistic experience

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,640
and um that's one of the big challenges

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,240
with spinnaker is how do you start tying

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
that together to the overall narrative

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,919
around

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,000
code build and delivery and not just you

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,600
know like software delivery so

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,919
i'm really looking i'm curious as well

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,120
to learn like how this how this uh

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,919
uh transition takes place over time

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,240
cool how about you otiano at patreon

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,240
yeah

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,000
uh i i thought it was notable uh just

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,799
listening to bridget and michael uh

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,200
that the the switch sort of that we're

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,399
talking

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,840
that you're talking about um uh

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,760
even though i definitely wear the

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,320
entering manager hat i have to

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,679
think about sort of the the the product

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,240
right i have to think about

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,159
really sort of an internal product uh

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,240
how we're shipping this tool and how it

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:11,679
really makes engineers lives better um

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,159
uh and that has sort of a multiplicative

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,240
effect

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,599
it it you know if i can make their the

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,720
engineers lives better

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,399
um that that that

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,879
that re redown sort of across the

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,560
organization um

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,560
so it is definitely a different way of

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,040
thinking about uh

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,919
uh infrastructure and a way of a

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,960
different way of thinking about

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,399
pipelines

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,359
um uh and i think it's really evolving

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,960
for us

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,520
uh again being uh having we've grown

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,119
from

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,119
kind of a very small team to a very

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,399
large team uh both in terms of

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,679
infrastructure and the broader

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,399
engineering team

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,359
uh so i think some of the problems other

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,639
folks face we

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:56,320
we we've managed to either avoid or or

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,440
or see on a very compressed timeline um

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,200
but we definitely have to think about uh

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,079
uh efficiency uh in a different way and

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,400
we have to look

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,160
at uh infrastructure in a different way

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,760
than than i have even in my career in

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,240
the past

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,680
yeah well yeah thank you for that and

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,400
you said one thing that

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,000
really resonates with me which is making

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,160
engineering lives better and it

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,240
reverberating across the organization

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,839
one of the reasons i ended up starting

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,160
armory was for that very

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,599
for that very reason was to make

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,119
engineering lives better

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,640
it didn't start off with spinnaker we

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,160
just believe that spinnaker is the best

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,240
way to accomplish that but

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,839
ultimately when you do that you get the

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,680
engineering team excited

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,280
uh they get product managers excited

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,079
they get the rest of the org excited and

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,079
they're able to ship

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,839
and deliver and just you just kind of

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,800
feel that momentum when you're moving

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,280
fast like

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,200
everybody feels it it really starts with

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,720
you make the engineering lives better

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,320
and it'll reverberate across the

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,240
organization especially

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,359
with organizations like all of yours

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,800
that are very

00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,640
software oriented um it just it has

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,000
a night and day effect and i've seen it

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,359
firsthand and

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,440
ultimately that was the impetus for

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,880
starting armory so i otto i really

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
really resonate with what you just said

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,760
there

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,119
how about usual on how how are things in

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,800
terms of looking at it from a product

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,640
perspective instead of just a developer

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,200
perspective

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,160
yeah so we also have like a product

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,599
owner role for

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,880
for different platform teams so we have

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,119
that role and and

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,320
we see that it's extremely valuable as

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,119
as

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,800
the organization grows it's not as easy

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,400
as it was before

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,839
and it helps treating platform as

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,599
a product which which is what it is and

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,440
your customers are developers and

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,560
improving their lives is what should

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,520
matter

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,000
and yeah just to add on what michael

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,119
said

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,839
we are also following that that path of

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,960
not forcing people to use certain tools

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,079
but making it

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,640
extremely easy to use them so

00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,280
yeah they will think several times

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,200
before

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,800
you know changing and certain

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,839
technologies or

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,960
certain processes because yeah

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,480
we try to support golden path with

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,480
several things that would come out of

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,240
the box and

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,400
so far it has worked really well and and

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,359
it you know getting requirements from

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,920
different teams

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,200
also helps us expand what we support

00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,200
from infrastructure team

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
thank you thank you very much well i

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,560
think that's all the time we have today

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,160
it's a perfect place to end on making

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,520
engineering's lives better making

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,400
people's lives better through the

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,720
software

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,320
that we deliver to our customers i think

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
that's a lot of what spinnaker does and

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,760
what it

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,640
embodies inside of the product there and

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,320
what netflix

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,240
uh you know strive to build when they

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,160
first built it was really around

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,839
making engineering lives better and from

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,440
there we would feel that impact on the

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,320
rest of the organizations

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,440
um so i really want to thank every one

00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,280
of the panelists

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,800

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,200
