Title: Spinnaker Observability in Practice with Kubernetes. - Jason McIntosh
Publication date: 2021-01-28
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	In our session, we will talk about how we are enabling the three pillars of Observability: monitoring, logs, and tracing, to ensure high-availability of our Spinnaker environments. Spinnaker can be chatty when it comes to Observability signals, and at Armory we use an observability platform vendor and operate many Spinnaker environments. Observability platform vendors typically charge by the number of metric time series (MTS), data points per minute (DPM), or amount of data ingested (Log Data). We recently released open-sourced a plugin for Spinnaker, the Armory Observability Plugin, that will enable us, among other things, to intelligently control costs with our Observability Vendor. After we talk about how enabling observability of Spinnaker in Kubernetes we will discuss what this enables us to do in practice, dashboards, alerting, canary deployments of Spinnaker services, etc, from an SRE and DevOps perspective.
