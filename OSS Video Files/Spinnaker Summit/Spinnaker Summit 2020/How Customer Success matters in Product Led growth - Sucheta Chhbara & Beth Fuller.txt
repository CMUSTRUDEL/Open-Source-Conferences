	Sucheta & Beth walk you through the journey of why sharing your pain points, not solutions, with customer success is the best way for you to get the solution you need. Talking to customer success early and often provides the CS team with the signals needed to share themes and customer trends with the Product team. Doing so allows both groups to dive into problem areas, from user experience gaps, feature gaps, or best practice recommendations. The CS team is your advocate, they are the life line for how to influence the product. - We talk to how our partnership works between CS and PM - How your ideas become features - When we partner we create best practice for better guardrails. - How culture vs technology weigh into our decisions.
