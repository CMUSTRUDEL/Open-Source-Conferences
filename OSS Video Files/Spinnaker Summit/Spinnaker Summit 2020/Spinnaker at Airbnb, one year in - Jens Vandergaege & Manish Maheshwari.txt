Description: 
	It’s been well over a year since Airbnb started investing into Spinnaker. In the past year we’ve hit some significant milestones in our quest to bring Continuous Delivery to all of Airbnb engineering. In this talk by Jens Vanderhaeghe (software engineer) and Manish Maheshwari (Project Manager), you will learn we’ve made Spinnaker generally available and how we’ve convinced hundreds of teams to adopt Spinnaker for their deployment process. We’ll cover some of the challenges we’ve faced fitting Spinnaker to Airbnb’s specific use cases and how we leverage Spinnaker to reduce Airbnb site downtime and improve deployment velocity.
