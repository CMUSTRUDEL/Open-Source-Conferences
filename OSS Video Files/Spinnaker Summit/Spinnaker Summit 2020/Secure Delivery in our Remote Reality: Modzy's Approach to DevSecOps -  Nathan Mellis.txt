Publication date: 2021-01-28
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	Even before COVID drove many to remote work, software development teams have been trending towards remote delivery, contractors, gig economy workers, and off-shore/near-shore contributors. Such a mixed landscape can make maintaining best practices with regards to DevSecOps, protecting your company's intellectual property, and delivering a quality product difficult. Modzy was born as a remote-native company with heritage and experience delivering cutting-edge technical solutions for some of the most security focused clients. Come hear how our adoption of industry best practices, such as the US Department of Defense's DevSecOps reference architecture and tools like Armory Spinnaker, allowed us to empower our developers to rapidly develop, test, and iterate on our product using Agile methodologies while simultaneously segmenting off those parts of our product that required more stringent security controls. We'll also cover how we isolate access to higher environments so that only our automated delivery pipelines have access to make changes, ensuring a consistent release process with a well-documented provenance.
