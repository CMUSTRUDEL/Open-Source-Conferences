Title: Growing Pains: Taking off the training wheels at Salesforce - Chuck Lane & Trey Morris
Publication date: 2021-01-28
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	We'll discuss the obstacles and challenges we faced growing Spinnaker from a proof of concept to a production deployment platform running more than a million executions a month across thousands of accounts across multiple substrates. Incorporating Spinnaker into a secure and robust deployment pipeline requires techniques for scaling and improving performance using features and functionality included in the Spinnaker codebase, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud Config while leveraging public cloud offerings. Additionally, Spinnaker can be extended to using Spring and in other ways that aren't always documented. We'd like to share some of our experience diving into the platform beneath Spinnaker and maybe help you avoid some of your own "Growing Pains".
