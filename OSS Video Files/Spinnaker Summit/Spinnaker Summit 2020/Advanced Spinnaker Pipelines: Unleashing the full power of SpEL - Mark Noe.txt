Publication date: 2021-01-22
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	In this workshop, walk through the construction of advanced Spinnaker pipelines building in intelligence using the power of SpEL, Spring Expression Language. SpEL is “a powerful expression that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime.” Put another way, SpEL is how you can make decisions and take specific actions dynamically from within a running pipeline. This workshop is led by Armory Solutions Architects who spend maybe a bit too much time making pipelines do flashy things.
