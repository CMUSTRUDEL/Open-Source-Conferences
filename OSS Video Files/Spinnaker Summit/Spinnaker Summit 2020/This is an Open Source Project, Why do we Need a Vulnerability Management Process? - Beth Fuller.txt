Title: This is an Open Source Project, Why do we Need a Vulnerability Management Process? - Beth Fuller
Publication date: 2021-01-12
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	This talk walks through why we are implementing a Vulnerability Management Process for OSS Spinnaker. How this protection is good for the community. Basic education on "How a CVE becomes a Document or Patched Code." Why all all this process and protection helps all our upstream OSS users and makes their lives easier.

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,080
hi

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,400
everybody welcome to why do i need a

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,599
vulnerability management process for

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,320
open source my name is beth and

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,720
i am a senior product manager at armory

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,359
i

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,279
am a lover of puns movie quotes and

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
making the lives of devops and security

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,920
folks

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,480
better why are we here

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,119
we are here to talk about vulnerability

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,480
management process now some of you may

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,760
have had to interface in this

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,800
process um and it wasn't particularly

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,000
your favorite

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,360
and that's okay so let's talk about how

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,399
to educate you in terms of what it means

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,920
what your role can be and why you want

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,079
something like this

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,239
for your enterprise as well as your open

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,280
source specifically your open source

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,640
projects

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
so we're going to start off by talking

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
about what cves are why a cvss score is

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,199
important

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
what is a vulnerability how do you patch

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,000
it why do you patch it

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,240
what is the spinnaker open source

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,159
vulnerability management process

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,600
why you want to see so csos are amazing

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,520
that's why and then how can you help

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,080
participate in this process it's going

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,759
to be fun i promise

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
and i only have like one deadpool

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,600
reference so like we're we're winning

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
here

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,119
so anyone who's perhaps had to work in a

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,159
cve

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,240
in uh situation maybe heartbleed

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,320
or any of the things that have come up

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,320
since then which i cannot remember but i

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,119
can always remember heartbleed

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,840
best name i guess is it feels a little

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,880
bit like

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,520
a tire fire which is not your favorite

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,399
most people are not a fan of a tire fire

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,680
dumpster fire

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,560
or any other kind of fire unless it's a

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,040
healthily contained campfire or maybe in

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
your house

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,479
so let's talk a little bit about

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,360
what cves are and how

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,560
this understanding more about cves and

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
that process

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,319
and creating a vulnerability management

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
process is going to make your life that

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,120
much easier

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,680
i promise maybe i can't

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,239
so first of all a cve might make you

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,040
feel a little bit like sad keanu

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,800
and you know i get it it's a little

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
unknown we don't know what's going on

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
he's hanging out there on his little

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,440
park bench eating a sandwich

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,840
maybe having a bad day so with cve

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,200
and again this uh just to make sure that

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,000
i'm clear the cve

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,720
and cvss threat modeling stuff that is

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
all

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,319
other people's knowledge that i am

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,840
sharing with you this is not mine

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,000
there are links to the appropriate

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,040
documentation

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,280
so a cve is a cyber security

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,840
vulnerability and exposure that is free

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,920
to search

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
use and incorporate into products and

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,879
services

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,000
what yes what that means is someone has

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,159
already identified

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
that there's a vulnerability out there

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,000
and they've created

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,959
a a nice little id for you so that you

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,159
can go

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,200
and clearly identify when that cve

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,760
is present within your technology

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,159
and how would you do that that is where

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,000
your security scans come in handy

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,920
why you get a security scan that is

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
going to identify for you

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,920
what those cves are

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
now let's move on to the cute and fuzzy

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,720
kitten

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,080
everybody loves the cute and fuzzy

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,519
kitten unless you're allergic in which

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
case still looking at cute and fuzzy

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,920
kittens

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,360
are fantastic so that brings us to the

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,480
common vulnerabilities

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,680
scoring system what that means

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,799
is we're going to create a score

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,640
for the cve why

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,920
well one of the reasons why is just

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
because the cve

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,480
is noted as being a high severity

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,280
critical cve doesn't mean that the way

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,400
that that code lives in your code base

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,720
that it's actually a high vulnerability

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,640
in fact you can have some instances

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,280
where you have a

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,799
high vulnerability cve let's say i'm

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,120
gonna pick a number out of the air

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,919
it's an eight but then after you kind of

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
run through

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,320
your own scoring system it turns out

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,199
that it's like a 1.9 and you're like

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,919
what that's magic can we do that with

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,400
all of them

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,199
no you really can't but let's talk about

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,479
how we

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,400
come about with a cvss score

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,000
whoa that looks like an awful lot of

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,360
stuff so

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,440
here is a calculator one calculator

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,000
there are many that are out there

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,320
and this calculator is going to take

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,120
what it does is it takes different

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,600
attack vectors it takes different areas

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
of

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
your technology and it helps you to come

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
up with a

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,080
score for how likely is it

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,520
that this is something that is

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,440
exploitable within your specific

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,520
project so if you take an open source

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,440
project you're going to take a look at

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,039
um and spinnaker for example you're

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,160
going to take a look at

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,199
how it if the cve lives in

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,720
um igor roscoe front 50

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,120
fiat uh orca gate wherever it lives

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,199
and you're gonna take a look at all the

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,960
different ways that somebody can

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,520
actually enter into that code base

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,199
and from there you're going to come up

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,960
with a score

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,120
my cat's going to join us there's no

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,120
call that is complete without a cat

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,800
from there what we do is we are going to

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,039
create

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,240
threat models because what we want to do

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,440
is we want to make sure that

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,880
that our cvss score is as defensible

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,000
as possible defensible that means that

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,039
we have to

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,919
protect that our scoring

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,440
is the way it is and not just hey we

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,880
didn't like that it was an eight we want

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
it to be a 1.9

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,800
now you need to demonstrate that the

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,080
reason why you scored it as a 1.9

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,199
is based on data

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,240
so a threat model is really one way that

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,240
you can do that

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,080
so if you take all the microservices for

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,240
spinnaker for example

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,400
what you need to identify is all the

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,600
entry points

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,319
that somebody can leverage to get in

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,520
there

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,639
how all of those microservices work

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,639
together

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,639
and then all the entry points in those

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,800
connections and then you just keep

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
taking it a layer up and a layer up and

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,400
a layer up

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,080
and what that tells you for the threat

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,520
model is

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,400
how embedded the code is

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,360
how protected the code is so you might

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,720
have something

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,400
that is a cve that lives

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
and let's say it lives in spinnaker it

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,800
lives in tecton and it lives in

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
argo those scores can be dramatically

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
different

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,639
in between between each of those

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,520
projects

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
and that's just based on the structure

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,520
of the microservices

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:22,080
those connections and the code base

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,400
makes sense so what do we do next

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,199
we've identified that something is

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,759
vulnerable

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,080
and so now we need to patch it and what

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,759
does that mean to patch it well

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,120
sometimes what that means is you need to

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,199
do a version bump

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
so let's say you need to do a spring

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,199
boot uh

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,680
a spring boot security version bump and

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,840
maybe that takes care of like 20 of your

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,360
cves

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,479
one action for 20 cbe yes

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,840
that is in fact how open source projects

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,080
and other enterprise projects would work

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
because you're pulling in other

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,960
technology to your open source

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
project so you need to understand what

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
the risks

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,919
are that you're pulling in as well as

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,599
any of the risks within the code that

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,039
you manage

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:15,280
so it's kind of like a cool ecosystem

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,639
why open source ought to have a security

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,039
posture

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,039
this is the the exciting part isn't it

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,879
so go out there grab your girl gang and

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,800
we are going to talk about why having a

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
security posture for your open source

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,719
project

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,519
helps with adoption yes it

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,120
does let's talk about why it helps with

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,519
adoption

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,560
so one of the reasons is let's talk

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,479
about the logic

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,399
of why you would want to fix a

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
vulnerability in open source to begin

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,560
with

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
so if you are an open source community

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,680
and

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,200
like spinnaker and you have financial

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,680
institutions or

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,480
you have retail insurance hospitals or

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,760
government

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,440
that use your product or your project

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,519
rather they are going to ensure

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
that that is secure which means they

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,839
have to do

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,279
a security cam security scan

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,839
themselves yes that's right they do

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,399
security scans on all their third-party

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,279
tools

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,760
open source enterprise it doesn't matter

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,720
and in some cases maybe it's a little

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,200
scarier

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,200
for those security folks if it is in

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,440
fact an open source project

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
because they don't know if you are

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,399
actually

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,600
managing and maintaining those

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,040
vulnerabilities

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,200
aka a great reason for having a

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,120
vulnerability management

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,160
process for your open source

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,160
so the best way to help with adoption is

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,000
with that vulnerability management

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,040
process if you are doing that

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
you have all these industries that have

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,760
the ability to

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,920
now start participating because it is a

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,240
more secure project that's right

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,440
and with that that means that they are

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,760
more inclined

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,640
to allow their employees to contribute

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,279
their time and donate their employees

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,600
time

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,320
to the project and the different

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,120
projects

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,399
that or features that are being built

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,680
that's amazing

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,079
so then you have this great outlook

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,320
of people that are coming to your

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,880
community that are using your product

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
that are going to battle test it and not

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,360
only that they're going

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,440
to expand what that project

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,600
might need to look like because they're

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,040
coming from different industries

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,519
and so you've created a richer fuller

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,760
project oh that wasn't a pun

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,800
so grow your project via vulnerability

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
management

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,279
there's a plan so if you have

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,760
a vulnerability management process that

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,200
is often a measure of a project's

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,720
maturity

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
what yes because what it does is it

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,800
demonstrates

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,880
that there's a direction and a

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,360
purpose that you're focused on with that

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
project it means that you've put in this

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,320
time

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,040
and effort and you have community

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,079
members that have donated their time

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,000
their knowledge so that they can make a

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,320
more secure

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,920
project it also allows you to

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
do planning so you can do regular scans

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,279
within

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,200
your project and that might mean that in

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,519
the future so for example in the future

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,760
for

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,120
spinnaker we want to get to the point

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,279
where we can do scans

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,519
before we merge code and you're probably

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,440
thinking oh my gosh that sounds terrible

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,800
isn't going to slow things down

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,880
yes and no it might slow things down

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,000
in that if you're going to merge code

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,160
and you do find

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,399
a fairly high vulnerability high

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,079
or critical vulnerability that you're

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,959
going to have to do some work

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,079
in terms of patching that or mitigating

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,200
what the risk is

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,120
with that cve now is that such a bad

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,320
thing would you rather

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,279
roll that out have someone

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,240
file an issue and then you have an

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,880
emergency

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,720
where you have to then fix it so this is

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,519
really just making things so that you

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,639
have fewer

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,120
tire fires now granted cves

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,880
new cves happen on a daily basis they're

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
identified on a daily basis

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,399
and that's just a thing that you will

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,760
have tire fires

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:42,959
or but perhaps not as many

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,519
ah the last one winning the hearts and

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,240
minds of the security team

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,920
so security people i absolutely adore

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,320
security people

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
and security teams are going to push to

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
ensure

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,200
that a project is safe enough

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,240
to stick around for the long haul why

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,959
why

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
well think about it if you're a security

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,120
person

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,480
one of your jobs is to make sure that

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,040
you keep your company out of the news

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
if you have teams that are pulling in a

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,880
whole bunch of

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,600
open source projects that means you have

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,760
to review

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,240
all this open source code to ensure

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,360
that that is safe that means that you've

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,880
put processes

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,000
in place that they cannot adopt

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,480
those projects upstream into

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,360
these organizations until scans have

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
happened

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
and then they're going to have to do

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,519
regular scans and it's going to slow

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,360
down the process

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:44,720
for upping the uh the intake

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,480
of new releases because there's this

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,839
concern

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,959
about including more cves

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,079
or if there are any that are found

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,320
it becomes an emergency and that means

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,760
that the team who wants to leverage that

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,399
open source project

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,279
might need to address that cve on their

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,360
own

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,480
making it less likely that they're going

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,880
to want to participate

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,959
if they are the only person as opposed

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,279
to having a team

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,279
it's like this when you think about that

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,000
scene in deadpool 2

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,800
it's the one where they're in the prison

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
and

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,279
and deadpool and cable are fighting and

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
it gets to the point where

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,399
uh ryan reynolds deadpool says to josh

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
rollins

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,320
uh cable alma says

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,199
you're so dark are you sure you're not

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,399
from the dc

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,519
universe and that's pretty much how i

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,600
view the importance

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,399
of having a vulnerability management

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,639
process is you want people to be less

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,519
cable and rigid and you want to move

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,519
them over

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,639
to more of a ryan reynolds aspect

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,839
or persona yeah

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,600
i know it's just a thing it's going to

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,320
happen

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,040
all right so the spinnaker open source

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,160
policy

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,279
document we're gonna go through that

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,000
step by step because it's awesome it's a

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,399
lot

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,880
and i'm not the one who came up with it

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,920
we had a cso that helped us so you know

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,760
that it's right

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:23,040
and it's using industry best practices

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,440
which is awesome all right

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
so for our first step we have a front

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,720
door

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,399
as with anything if you enter a place

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,880
you have your front door which is your

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,360
primary entrance for things to

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,320
that you can decide what comes in and

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,839
what doesn't

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,560
or who or in this case which

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,440
vulnerabilities

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,160
so the idea here is that you have

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,440
security at spinnaker.io

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,199
and everyone has the opportunity or op

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,120
has the ability to send any

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,560
vulnerabilities that they find

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,920
and for right now if they find a cve um

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,839
then they as an cve with an id as well

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,040
as maybe a new vulnerability

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,519
they send it to security at spinnaker.io

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,040
actually that's not going to change but

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,839
that's where you would send it

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,040
then we have a set of time within that

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,079
security sig

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,839
to review those requests to go through

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:23,440
an entire process to identify the risk

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:27,199
associated with that additionally

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,320
we have a security policy that is posted

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,720
on the spinnaker github repositories

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,440
yes that's right so you don't have to

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,560
remember

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,959
spinnaker at our security at

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,320
spinnaker.io

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,320
based on this conference talk instead

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,440
you can go to the repository and you can

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,639
see what

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,959
that um security policy is and it's just

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,040
there

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,320
the information is available to you

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,880
which is amazing

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,639
because who wants to figure out like oh

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,800
i saw it in slack

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,000
there might be a document over here i

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,440
don't know where it is

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,440
no it's just right there

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,839
and i skipped so the next thing

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,240
is what does that security sig team do

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,039
with those vulnerabilities essentially

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,959
what happens

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,319
is we go through and we're going to

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,000
identify is this an

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:24,240
unknown issue or not we're going to

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,679
assess if the vulnerability

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,960
if they're um like does this

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,960
vulnerability apply

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
in the context of a deployed spinnaker

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,039
instance i'm just going to read it

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
because it's

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,640
far cleaner than if i would wing it off

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,000
the top of my head

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,360
so essentially what we want to know is

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,799
where does the cve how it's tucked

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,919
into our code how does it impact someone

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,760
can someone who's a bad actor actually

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,559
get to it and cause damage

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,960
are the exploits or proof of concept

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,440
code

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
are there exploits or clue proof of

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,600
concept

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
code to take advantage of the

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,120
vulnerability

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,320
what yes essentially what you want to

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,120
find out here

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,120
is in the case of heartbleed one of the

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,720
reasons why that became

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,640
and hopefully i'm getting this right but

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,120
one of the reasons why that became such

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
a big deal is because not only was the

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,880
vulnerability

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,480
announced but how to exploit it was

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,559
announced as well

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,679
and that's when it becomes a fairly

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,880
critical thing

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,799
for you to jump on and address so that

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
is taken into consideration

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,880
as we're going through and reviewing the

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,679
different vulnerabilities

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,400
and the next you need to assess which

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,880
versions

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,000
are impacted by this like how far back

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,000
do we need to go

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:53,120
how big of an issue is it how how broad

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,360
is this um how broad is the impact

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,720
so once you've done that we basically we

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,360
have a taxonomy

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,039
in terms of for the spinnaker open

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,559
source project which is

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,760
here um and this basically talks about

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,640
how we rank and rate the

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,360
high medium and low and then there's

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,080
going to be a corresponding time frame

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,600
in which we will mitigate those

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,799
vulnerabilities

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,799
which is very important

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,559
next we're going to go through and track

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,039
this and we're going to track it in an

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,640
issues only private repository you're

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,280
probably thinking really

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,960
but yes you want it in an issues only

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,200
private repository

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
and the reason for that is because you

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,160
don't want everyone to have

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,400
access to a vulnerability

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
that is a known vulnerability within

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,360
your open source project

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,600
because that means a bad actor can come

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
in

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,559
and exploit it so if you're doing

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,679
something like a continuous delivery

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,240
project like spinnaker open source what

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,799
that

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,840
does is that opens you up to people

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,640
being able to

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,320
break in to that process and getting

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,440
access to pii data

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,360
perhaps um deploying code that they

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,320
shouldn't be able to deploy because you

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,640
don't want that

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,919
or who knows what else they have the

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,000
ability to then

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,960
daisy chain to get into within your

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,320
system so it's just it's best to keep it

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,280
in an issue only private repository

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,520
but not to worry it does become public

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,520
after all the issues and communications

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,760
have happened

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,039
so we go through and if it doesn't have

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,320
an id

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,600
then we will get an id uh we'll do the

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,840
cvss score

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,600
as we kind of talked about before we're

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,480
gonna have an understanding and an

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,080
explanation

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,400
of the vulnerability and all the

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,799
different components that it addresses

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,840
so that's where we get to figure out is

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,400
this something like

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,760
spring boot security and all we need to

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
do is bump the

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,400
um bump the version on it and that's

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,840
going to solve those 20 odd issues

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,600
if that's all it is that's great and so

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,280
then those are the things that we need

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,039
to as we're going through this step

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,559
three and tracking the vulnerability

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,000
that's the kind of information that you

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,200
want to find out

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,039
so then it's not that you're just

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,520
sending it out to people and saying hey

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,840
vulnerability good luck instead you're

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,000
really streamlining that process

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,440
is it within the microservice or is it

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,080
something that spans across

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,840
all microservices because there's more

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,039
efficient and effective ways to address

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,600
and then we would write something up

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,840
about it

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,720
and we would talk about the timeline for

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,760
mitigating

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,760
the vulnerability

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,600
pretty logical after that we would

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,799
mitigate it

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,440
and the end result being if you look at

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,840
a lot of organizations atlassian being

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
one

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,240
one that i think most people have um a

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,080
product most people have used

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,760
there's a there's usually a security

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,120
page and it's going to talk about the

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,039
vulnerabilities

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,200
that have been addressed and what

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,840
version what version it impacted where

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,159
it was

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,960
when it was fixed and what the fix was

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,080
or some

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,880
bit of information that is the goal in

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,080
the future

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,200
that we will have that as part of the um

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,640
open source vulnerability process so

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,360
you're probably thinking about this and

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,919
that you're like

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,520
yeah but still why would i want to have

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,080
that for open source

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,600
well also let's take into consideration

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,280
all the people that are using

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,360
open source upstream now you've created

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,960
a scenario where people might have to

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,200
actually branch or fork your code

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,000
so that they can address the cves as

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,400
opposed to you

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
just addressing it at the root so then

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,600
you become like this

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,840
a far more powerful entity or project

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,080
because you're already addressing all of

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,120
this you have a standard

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,320
industry standard way of handling it

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,360
you've turned people more less cable and

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,280
more

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,520
deadpool now let's talk about the power

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,880
of

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,039
a ciso the great thing

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,720
is is we actually have a ciso that

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,679
helped us um

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,960
with our security sig and coming up with

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,799
all of this process

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,240
trust me this is not something that i

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,280
did on my own

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,600
this was definitely a group effort so we

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,200
had other security professionals

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,440
that participated from other

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,640
organizations so it also wasn't just an

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,480
armory event it was definitely an

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,880
open source security event where we had

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,720
um security folks from multiple

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,559
organizations

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,320
i know that was a little redundant but i

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,159
just want to make sure it's clear that

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,200
this is best practice according to

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,960
a number of people a collective

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,120
so one of the great things about having

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,320
a ciso is it's going to affirm the

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,039
security posture

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,799
of the open source community see so

00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,440
security people they all talk to each

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,960
other

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,000
which is good and bad they have their

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,320
own language they

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
talk to each other in a very particular

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,520
way and

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,120
i know as a product manager i'm not

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,279
gonna step in that lane

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,039
because i don't live in that world and

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,159
i'm not even gonna pretend

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:21,679
so as i've used specific terminology

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,080
it's very basic and the reason for that

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,679
is i'm not going to throw out a bunch of

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,000
security terms

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,600
because i want to use word vomit if i

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,679
wanted to do that you know i'd like

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,960
double click on the synergy

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,080
and pivot um i'm not gonna do that

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,640
and so it's best to have someone who

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,799
actually

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,799
understands that language and

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,840
understands the risks and understands

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,960
the challenges

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,200
of security folks and security teams so

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,919
if

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,559
you can as you're building out a

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,200
vulnerability process management process

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,000
for your open source project grab some

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,000
csos

00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,679
grab some security professionals and

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,919
have them help you

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,720
to build out that pattern and best

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,799
practice

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,559
or mimic other projects that are doing

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,679
things really well i know the

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,480
kubernetes community does a great job um

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,840
so just

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,960
follow some of those other best

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,600
practices

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,679
the other thing it does help with is

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,240
because there is that connection with

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,840
csos and because a lot of folks

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,600
that industry they all talk to each

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,720
other having

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,400
that name and that person is part of

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,720
their brand

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,559
and when it's part of their brand all

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,279
and everyone talks to each other

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,080
you have the opportunity within your

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,679
open source

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:45,120
project to bring in a level of comfort

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,360
for some people that are stepping

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,799
in so they're like oh i feel a little

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,080
nervous about it

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,120
but hey i trust this person and i know

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,679
what their skill set

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,880
is and i understand that they followed

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,960
best practice

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,760
that those are that best practice is

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,760
going to be followed

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,200
collaboration how can we all help

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,320
so what do we need from you in order to

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,440
make this vulnerability process

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,760
successful

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,799
one is remember security at spinnaker.io

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,240
if you are working in the um

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,000
if you're working in the project and you

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,279
come across something and it seems a

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,640
little bit hinky

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,679
um you've noticed that this might be a

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,520
problem

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,320
send an email it's what we're here for

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,960
you can also participate in the cve

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,120
process

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,240
so if you want to be a participant let's

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,440
say you're a budding security person

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,480
and you want to dive into this then this

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,000
is a great

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,919
way to gain some skill set

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,080
in this area because you're going to

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,559
again have a cso that's going to and

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,279
other security professionals that are

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,559
going to help

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,320
guide what this process is and how to be

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,360
successful with it

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,360
join the security sig we talk about

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,640
all kinds of security related things

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,799
right now we've really been going

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,279
through the vulnerability process

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,960
and how we're going to implement that

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,640
but sometimes we talk about really fun

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,200
things like

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,720
i don't know weird ways that people have

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,799
used duct tape and

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,760
to do construction work in our homes

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,080
previously

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,240
i mean you can't beat some of those

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,679
stories there's some weird ones

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,480
people do funky stuff when they're

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,640
working on homes

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,559
ask questions in the security sig

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,120
channel it's a great place

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,559
if you don't know ask a question if you

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,760
don't feel comfortable having it in

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,600
slack again

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,679
security at spinnaker.io

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,279
the other thing you can do is help us

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,840
create threat models

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,080
that's a very complex thing for a

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,720
project that is as complex

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,120
as spinnaker and one of the great things

00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,520
about

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,399
creating that threat model is you can as

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,039
you go through

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,559
and you find those breach points one of

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,320
the things that we might find out

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:11,360
are ways to streamline some of

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,279
our uh some of our codes some of our

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,159
features that we have in there

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,880
and it might shake out some enhancements

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,760
and that's

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,760
amazing

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,640
so hopefully you learned a little bit

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,799
about the reason why

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,279
you would want a vulnerability

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,720
management process with your open

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,480
the open source project that you're

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,320
working on i might

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,919
suggest that you go to a couple of other

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,279
talks if you want to learn a little bit

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,960
more about security

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:44,080
i know that jacques and jacob

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,919
and tim are doing a policy related

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,520
uh conversation and they're also going

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,640
to talk about some of the challenges

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,799
with fiat

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,080
because you know travis doesn't want to

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,279
fix it again

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,960
there's also lee faust and andrew way

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,320
that are going to be doing a talk on

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,720
policy driven deployment

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,679
and there are plenty of others so please

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,840
join some of those

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,279
other talks and learn a little bit more

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,679
about how

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,039
the community is thinking about securing

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,159
the product

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,159
and i'm going to stop this recording so

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:21,360
that you can ask any questions that you

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,360
