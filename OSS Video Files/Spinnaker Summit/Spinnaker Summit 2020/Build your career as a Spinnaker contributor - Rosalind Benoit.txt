00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,360
i'm roslyn benoit and i work on the

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,559
spinnaker community and other open

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,320
source initiatives at

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,000
armory i'm here today to talk to you

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
about how to become a spinnaker

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,880
contributor

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,880
and just a note before i begin um

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,359
i am going to share a lot of links today

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,840
in this presentation so i've decided to

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,640
only make you remember one link you can

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,519
go to

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,560
uh this link github.com spinnaker dash

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,880
hackathon

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,120
how to contribute and i will share a

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
summary of this presentation along with

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,559
all the links i'm sharing

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,719
so that you only need to uh write down

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,920
that one link

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,520
so let's get started i was searching for

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,360
the right metaphor to use for this

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,039
presentation like how can i talk about

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,960
something that continues to evolve as

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
you work on it it's a fluid process of

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,640
continued investment

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,239
you're applying it you're getting reward

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,520
as you go but then you have to do more

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,039
work more investment

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
it was tempting for me to go with some

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960
kind of mad max fury road metaphor but

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,360
that doesn't quite work

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,119
and the obvious comparison to me is one

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,200
that you've heard me use before

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,439
yes i'm a tree hugger yes i live in

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,040
portland my family has a tiny farm and

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,479
we grew our own vegetables as much as

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
possible so the metaphor that makes the

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,080
most sense to me is a garden

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
when you're planting a garden you start

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,000
out by putting the work in and you

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
really have no evidence that it's going

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,920
to pay off

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,400
but if you work diligently you are able

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,200
to reap

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,200
different benefits throughout the season

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,880
each year brings different challenges

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,040
one year it's the powdery mildew

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
next year you have aphids then it's some

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,479
kind of rodent you've got rabbits you've

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,240
got gophers then the weather just

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,640
doesn't cooperate right and

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,680
as you do this year after year as you go

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
through it you learn

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
over time how to adapt to the different

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,280
conditions

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,280
and you set up processes to more easily

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,720
or routinely deal with the challenges as

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
they come up or better yet

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,719
you set up tools to prevent them and

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,600
streamline your process over time and

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,479
over the years

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
your dividends also increase the soil

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,840
becomes richer

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,280
and the produce becomes more bountiful

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,479
what we've learned since planting our

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,119
first crops on the farm

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,959
is that relationships add a ton of

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,640
leverage to this process

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
so as we learn to grow grapes for

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,160
example as total newbies

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,080
like reading about it is valuable but

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,560
joining the local viticultural community

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,560
has been

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
vital because our neighbors have dealt

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,599
with the same issues in the same

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,120
conditions and can give us the best

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,879
advice

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,480
and as we've developed a community of

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,120
friends in oregon we've gone from it

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
taking

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,120
days to do a harvest to neatly

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,879
completing it in less than a day

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
when my parents need labor throughout

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,000
the year to do the heavy lifting they

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,160
have folks to call on to help

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
and the cool thing about it is we all

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,599
have a vested interest in it

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
we all eat the vegetables we all taste

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
the wine and enjoy the fruits of our

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,519
labor

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800
so we're really not working for free

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,000
because we're getting something out of

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,000
it but at the same time

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
it's fun we get to do something that we

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,319
enjoy with others who feel the same way

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,400
and we get closer as a community so my

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,879
pitch to you is that open source is like

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
a spin

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,239
is like a garden and spinnaker is a huge

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,400
garden

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,560
in the early years of its life it offers

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
so much possibility so much area for

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,000
growth and for rich return

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,480
and just like a garden the spinnaker

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
project requires constant input to grow

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,239
and thrive

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
we need you to join us to grow the

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,879
project

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
provide feedback on it help maintain it

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,599
and rise to leadership levels in the

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,519
project

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,799
so let's talk about places to contribute

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,799
and i will share my screen now

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,239
so the first kind of no-brainer way to

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
get involved in the community is to join

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,480
us on spinnaker slack

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,040
this is our hub of asynchronous project

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,920
communication and as of today it has 10

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,920
480 members this is a great place to go

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,120
as you enter the spinnaker community to

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,760
learn and get feedback

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
as you discover spinnaker and begin

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,159
contributing

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,519
i'm going to talk more about specific

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,000
channels and opportunities

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,360
on this slack throughout this talk if

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,959
you're coming into the spinnaker

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,799
community with some experience as a

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
spinnaker operator or user

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,319
an excellent way to contribute and to

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
begin establishing your profile in the

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,280
community is to begin answering

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,040
questions that come up

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
when you know the answer or if you have

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
some context that may be helpful

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
reach out to these folks in slack who

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,959
are looking for help and start engaging

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,120
with them

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,880
so how can you start making other

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
attainable contributions that really

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,280
matter

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,600
first i want to start off with some

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,440
fundamentals

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,960
um i want to talk first about the nuts

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,680
and bolts of the spinnaker stack

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,280
so when contributing to oh yeah first of

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,600
all when you're contributing to

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,560
um spinnaker repositories you're going

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
to use a

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
fork and pull request work with workflow

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,919
this is common to open source projects

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,240
so you're probably familiar with it but

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,160
in case you're not i use this just

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,880
as a cheat sheet for this workflow and

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,800
i'll share it in my repository

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,919
so much of spinnaker's backend is

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
written in java

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,199
and the preferred backend languages are

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
first

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,720
kotlin but using java is also totally

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560
acceptable

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
a significant portion of spinnaker is

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,520
also written in groovy

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,680
and if you're ever working on things

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
that touch those components know that

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,960
transforming the code that you touch

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
into java

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,680
is a very welcome contribution as as

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,639
groovy as deprecated

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,440
dac spinnaker's front end uses types

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
typescript

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,440
and react and there are some really good

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,039
beginner-friendly

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,960
ui issues oh this is deck

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,240
yeah so this is this is written in

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,000
typescript and

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,720
uses react so there are some really good

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
ui

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,680
issues uh in this big list of

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,880
issues tagged beginner friendly in

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,840
github

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,039
another place to look at is the spin cli

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,720
the spin cli

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,880
is written in go and this is a great

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,840
place to begin contributing improvements

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,919
for folks who don't want to make who who

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
don't want to work in kotlin java or

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,000
typescript but do want to make technical

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,919
code contributions to the project

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
and also if you have a passion for

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,960
another tool in the sdlc that isn't

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,720
currently

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,319
integrated with spinnaker or if you

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,120
desire a richer integration than what's

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
available

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,960
spinnaker's plug-in framework go here to

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,880
the overview

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
spinnaker's plug-in framework gives you

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,000
the opportunity to rapidly build a

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,720
spinnaker extension

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,639
in kotlin or java using established

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,400
extension points so that you don't have

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,080
to dive deeply into spinnaker's

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,919
internals to extend it

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,600
you can learn more about this here in

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
the plug-in creators guide on

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
spinnaker.io

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,800
and you can also check out our youtube

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,120
channel

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,319
uh we have a wonderful workshop here uh

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
recently from

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
uh armory engineer cameron on building

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
your first plugin

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,400
finally if you are familiar with

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,800
kubernetes there is a lot of exciting

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,360
work

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,840
happening in the kubernetes sig so i'll

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,440
go here in slack

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,759
and i'm here in the sig kubernetes

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,520
channel as well as in the

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,880
platforms sig which is working on

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,199
automation for the deployment of

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,880
spinnaker itself on kubernetes

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,039
using the spinnaker operator this is a

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
currently lives in the in the armory

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,400
organization but

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,400
is open source and pr is welcome

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
using the spinnaker operator customize a

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,080
new tool called

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,960
cleat which is used for managing

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,360
spinnaker configuration files

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,560
so lots of opportunity to contribute

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
there

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,160
here is the contributing page go to it

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,919
here

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,240
here's the contributing page that we

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,120
recently updated to provide guidance on

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,680
spinnaker contributions

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,199
and this is a work in progress and uh

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,240
poll requests are welcome all these

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,560
resources

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,840
so you'll need a development environment

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,919
to develop and test

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,400
technical spinnaker contributions and

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,840
setting one up can be a challenge

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,840
to begin with there are several

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,319
different ways to install spinnaker

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
so the classic method is to clone and

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,080
install

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,240
each spinnaker service locally

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,400
this page provides a guide for this

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,520
method it uses the halyard installation

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,360
and management tool

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,280
this method is viable but it does

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,560
require a lot of local resources we

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,479
highly recommend using

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,199
and you should really have more than 18

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,000
gigabytes of ram uh 32

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
um is the is the minimum that i've heard

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,520
more recently so that's a place to

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,720
contribute here

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,160
this this method can be quite

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,759
challenging so many developers have

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,840
found that leveraging kubernetes to

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,199
install and manage spinnaker services is

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,960
faster and easier

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,720
so you can install spinnaker in your

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,639
kubernetes cluster that runs in your

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,520
cloud provider of choice

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,520
a considerable effort has been made to

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,800
simplify this process for developers who

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,880
are participating in

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,839
spinnaker gardening days our hackathon

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,719
program

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,680
and we've leveraged aws eks along with

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,279
telepresence

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,959
to manage the communication between

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,640
spinnaker services when you're actively

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,399
developing on your local machine

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,720
and the rest of the spinnaker cluster is

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,959
running in kubernetes and eks

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
while aws currently only offers free

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,959
compute during gardening days

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,880
this training can always provide helpful

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
guidance on using the operator and other

00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,839
tools to deploy and develop against

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,519
spinnaker

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,040
another option for your development

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,360
environment would be to install

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,760
miniker this is a spinnaker instance

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,000
that runs in a linux virtual machine on

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,680
your

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,200
local on your local device using k3s

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,240
under the hood so this is a video this

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
here

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,279
is a video instruction guide that i'll

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,399
link you to

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,519
for this method on spinnaker.io but the

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,080
instructions on

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,360
github are more current probably and i

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,240
think there's a new guide

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,240
quick start guide in progress we are

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,760
working on developing more standards and

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,519
easier methods to help you

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,360
get fully set up to develop against

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,279
spinnaker quickly and easily

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,279
so please share your feedback on these

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,800
methods or your own process

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,480
in the you can share it in the gardening

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,160
general channel because lots of folks

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,480
paying attention to it here and you can

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,240
also share it in the dev toolkit channel

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,399
where some folks have

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,600
less recently had conversations about

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,440
developing a dev toolkit for spinnaker

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,279
so what if you don't want to write code

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
or you are looking for additional ways

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,079
to participate

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
i want to start with the spinnaker

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,560
community blog so

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,920
let's say you have a blog that you're

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
writing or you've already published

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,880
about spinnaker and you'd like for it to

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,640
be featured on the spinnaker community

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,320
blog we would love to help you with that

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,480
make sure that you have a medium account

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,600
for posting it and reach out to me

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,519
or reach out in the cx channel

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,959
here on spinnaker slack and we'll help

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,240
you get it published to the

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,360
spinnaker community blog what could you

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,800
post about

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,800
there are lots of ideas any of the

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,120
spinnaker summit or spinnaker live talks

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,880
have

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,320
excellent content for you to dive into

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,320
and share your takeaways from but of

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,120
course we care about your use cases the

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,519
most

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
so do you use spinnaker with jenkins

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,040
lots of people want to hear about that

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,600
do you use spinnaker with kubernetes or

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,440
do you deploy spinnaker on kubernetes

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
share how you're doing these things how

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,800
you're working with jenkins and why and

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,079
what works for you

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,040
and the point that you're at in your

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,120
journey also spinnaker tutorials and

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,240
videos are very helpful to develop for

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
this project so

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
you can reach out to us in that same cx

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
channel for help getting your

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,959
tutorials and your videos onto the

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,640
spinnaker youtube and other media

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,399
channels that we have access to

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,000
we have a special need for short

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,399
training videos that focus on one

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,399
specific task or workflow in spinnaker

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
and of course beginner user tasks are

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,320
welcome

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,480
we'd like to be able to string those

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,480
together into training playlists if you

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,680
ever want to deliver a live spinnaker

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,839
tutorial or demo

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,680
or you want to get involved in other

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,800
technical ambassadorship opportunities

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,680
such as meetups

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,360
one option is to become a cdf ambassador

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,360
so

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,880
this program is organized by spinnaker's

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,920
parent organization the continuous

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,839
delivery foundation

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,120
and will allow you to network and join

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,360
with um

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,800
yeah we'll allow you to network and join

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,519
with

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,600
um folks working in our sister projects

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,839
jenkins tecton screwdriver

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,120
and work on interoperability initiatives

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,279
or what you're interested with the

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,360
populations that you care about

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,399
now where else can you tell your story

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,680
i'm here on the success stories page on

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,000
spinnaker.io and there's a super easy

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,279
way here to add value

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,120
you can write a simple testimonial

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,880
it only takes a few minutes you fill out

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,000
the form that's linked here submit and

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,440
then you're done

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,959
we have a lot of nice ones already on

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,079
here and this page is on spinnaker.io

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,480
which is our project website and

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,399
documentation hub and it also happens to

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,800
be an excellent place to contribute

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,639
so speaking of tutorials we could really

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,639
use new content added to

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,079
yeah we could really use new new content

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
added to

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,880
our guides area tutorials

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,680
welcome here and we have several

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,440
code labs here that are out of date

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,079
there's plenty of room for you to share

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
new labs that give a more current view

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,760
of spinnaker functionality and

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,200
capabilities so show us what you got

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,440
and more generally spinnaker

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,360
documentation has a lot of room to grow

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,360
with more detailed explanations of

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
processes and architecture so pull

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,880
requests are welcome

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,240
we also have a need for process process

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
visualizations

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,160
so if you can share screenshots or

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,519
illustrations of a process or concept

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,120
that you think would benefit from a

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,760
deeper explanation

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,959
please do now you might ask is there a

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,279
way to contribute

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,079
just by highlighting work that needs to

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,920
be done

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,360
even if you can't or don't have time to

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,000
do it yes

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,519
this is where issues come in so the code

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
labs that i'm showing you here

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,519
are a perfect example of this so i'll go

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
to one of the code labs

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,040
and as i'm walking through it

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,079
if i get stuck or if i find something

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,480
that's clearly out of date

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,120
the best thing to do there is to simply

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,959
file an

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
issue and that will cue up you or

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,000
another contributor

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,360
to add value and and with a clearly

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
scoped contribution

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
without taking the time to investigate

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,839
it first so

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,880
file issues and comment on issues when

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
you have context

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,320
on them to add to your expertise like to

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,839
add add your expertise to the

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
conversation even if you can't solve the

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,279
problem

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,959
so when you do notice an issue or

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,920
something that doesn't look right

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,040
you can first head to the spinnaker

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,600
issue tracker

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,279
this is the spinnaker issue tracker here

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
and first you should search

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,120
to see if an issue already exists for

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,279
what you've noticed

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,760
now one clarification here all the

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,160
issues for the spinnaker project

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,480
are consolidated into this spinnaker

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,760
repository issues area in the spinnaker

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
org and then they're tagged with

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,839
different uh

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,880
different areas of specialization

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,519
except for spinnaker.github.io that's

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,120
our documentation and website

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,639
and this is the only spinnaker

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,720
repository that

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,560
currently manages its own issue tracker

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,320
here

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,839
for your information this location

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,839
itself is going to change soon because

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,240
we're currently migrating spinnaker.io

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,079
to another static site generator hugo

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,279
the migration will be complete this year

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,440
in 2020

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,680
and the new site is uh spinnaker.io in

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,600
the same spinnaker organization

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,519
documentation sig is considering

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,920
migrating issue maintenance of the new

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,079
site

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,760
to the spinnaker spinnaker repository

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,000
where all the other project issues

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,839
are so that it's consistent if you have

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
feedback we haven't made a decision yet

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,199
if you have feedback on this please

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,240
share it with us in the

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,000
sig documentation channel on slack

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,760
and we would love to engage with you

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
about it

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,519
speaking of that i keep using this

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,320
acronym sig what is a sig

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,759
and by the way who's going to deal with

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,880
all of these issues that i'm telling you

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,680
to file

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,279
a sig is an acronym for a special

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,160
interest group

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,920
and this is a fundamental part of

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,720
spinnaker's governance structure

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,839
there are 12 active and approved sigs

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
currently

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,880
sigs meet periodically to discuss their

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,560
interest area

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
and sig leaders take on additional

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,160
project maintenance duties such as

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,839
reviewing poll requests and responding

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
to issues related to their area of

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,560
interest or expertise

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,480
each sig has its own slack channel and

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,440
all the sig slack channels begin with

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,000
sig dash so that's an easy way to browse

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
them

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,040
and in these channels active sig

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,720
participants and leads talk

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,240
asynchronously between meetings to

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,759
collaborate on projects

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,199
provide help to the community and

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,600
discuss issues that are relevant to

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,519
their

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,279
area of interest now some of these

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,440
channels are more active than others

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,199
but they are all periodically active and

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
they're not tied to any one event or

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,880
period of time

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,959
the sig leaders also meet periodically

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,279
with the technical oversight committee

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,880
to address project matters and things

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,560
that's this is a technical oversight

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,839
committee or toc for short you can read

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,120
more about this in spinning

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,680
government's documentation in the

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,040
governance repository um

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,240
sig leaves and technical oversight

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
committee will get together to talk

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,040
about issues that

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,120
affect multiple sigs or are of great

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,560
consequence to the project

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,959
and um you know we talked a moment ago

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,519
about

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,680
issues and some of you watching this may

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,440
have had the experience of submitting an

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,279
issue to spinnaker and not receiving a

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,000
response or if you did the issue might

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,799
have stalled

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,640
and became sale it's so sad when this

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,000
happens and it's one of the reasons that

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,439
i'm here talking about this

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,319
with you today so let's keep talking

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,880
about it now how can you get involved

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,240
you can show up in a sig channel or at a

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,839
sig meeting

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,439
when i say sig meeting there's a

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,079
calendar of all the sig meetings here

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,760
that's linked on the sigs page that i

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,120
showed you a minute ago yep this is the

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,240
sig calendar it shows you all the

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,760
different meeting times

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,360
you can go into those meetings or the

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
channels ask the questions that you're

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,000
curious about

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,520
ask for context explain how you might

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,360
want to get involved talk about what

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,440
your connection to spinnaker is

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
if a sig meeting is set at a time that

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,919
you can't attend because of your time

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,679
zone

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,080
reach out in the sig channel to engage

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,919
and ask for a sig meeting recording

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,440
so that you can review the meeting

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,200
content async

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,720
if you're contributing regularly and you

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,720
really want to engage live

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,600
i would consider proposing that your sig

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,720
rotate meeting times across time zones

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,400
as many global open source projects do

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,559
the reason that it's so important for me

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
to tell you about sigs now is that

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,160
our sigs are typically the folks

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,840
responsible for issue triage

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
and response within their areas of

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,760
interest and expertise

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,600
and there's a huge area of opportunity

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,600
for folks to join sigs

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,360
learn and understand the project context

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,799
through the sig's work and then use that

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,480
to attain leadership roles in the

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,320
project over time

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,600
and the project really needs to do a

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,240
better job

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,559
of nurturing people into those roles

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,480
passing our institutional knowledge on

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,200
to them and also just lowering the

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,880
barriers to entry to like help use get

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,679
set up to succeed

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,520
now speaking of that not all of the

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
spinnaker sigs are just for code we

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,640
mentioned the documentation sig and that

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,400
is an excellent place to begin your

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,120
spinnaker contribution journey

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,320
there are also sigs for each major cloud

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,880
provider

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,960
and your feedback on deployment issues

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,679
tool use and challenges is super

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,280
valuable there

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,919
even if you're not actively building any

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,600
solutions there is even a spinnaker

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,760
summit sig which will work with the

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,440
linux foundation events team to plan the

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,559
summit and make it a great experience

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
for you

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,240
and there's one last non-code sig that's

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
proposed

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,080
currently going through the approval

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
process that i would like to talk about

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,280
because i'm really excited about it so

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,799
this is the contributor experience sig

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
proposal

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,080
the contributor experience sig aims to

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
work to

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,559
to make the project a more welcoming

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,360
accessible and productive space for all

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,400
contributors

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,400
new and old so what if you don't

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,840
have a good experience as a newcomer to

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
spinnaker what if that what if it

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,960
doesn't work out

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,000
what if you have an idea or something

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,720
that would make the project

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,160
itself more welcoming or effective this

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,039
sig will be there

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,799
to listen to receive your feedback to

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,720
assist you if it's possible and

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,240
also work with cigs and governance to

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,559
improve the experience for all

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,919
contributors over time so if you're

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,679
passionate about the contributor

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,640
experience or you have any feedback on

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,480
this for now

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,559
you can you can reach out at this point

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,720
in the cx channel

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,840
on spinnaker slack and engage with us

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
about it

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,520
and um introduce yourself

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,200
with uh to us and just share any

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,960
feedback that you have we'd love that

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,480
the cx-sig will also be working on

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,400
creating a new project

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,480
contributor role so when i say role

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,480
there's a role structure here

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,520
that has fewer qualifications for

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,360
newcomers and

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
also they'll be working on recognizing

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,840
and rewarding new contributions as they

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,000
come in

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,080
so that you feel seen you feel heard and

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,679
you feel celebrated when you contribute

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,360
this is coming soon and it's super

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,120
important now

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,960
what's the benefit of attaining one of

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,559
these roles in a spinnaker project or

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,520
what's the benefit of contributing at

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,919
all

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,679
devops knowledge and expertise in any

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,320
capacity in the sdlc

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,280
has a ton of value in the marketplace

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,840
and the community

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,840
is a chance to learn from your peers and

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,600
gain more of that context

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,880
you will have the opportunity to work

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,480
with developers from

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,919
aws microsoft salesforce netflix

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,280
autodesk target spotify adobe oracle

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,080
datadog ibm

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,480
the home depot huawei many many more to

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,400
solve

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,760
shared problems around the software

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
development lifecycle

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,120
and this is a great networking

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,320
opportunity for you

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,159
this tool spinnaker has the prestige and

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,760
buy-in from enterprise companies

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,320
as diverse as airbnb and jpmorgan chase

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,559
so this really matters on your resume

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,960
and the face of this project is evolving

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,120
so you can be part of growing it into a

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,960
new generation of software leaders

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,200
bringing developer empowerment to the

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,400
world and really understanding the power

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,080
of that

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
the project does have some rough edges

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,600
right now and your experience may not

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
always be smooth

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,799
we are sorry about that

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,880
this means that you have the opportunity

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,440
to be essential in the change that needs

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,760
to come

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,520
so we will work to open the doors to you

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,120
and create an on-ramp that makes you

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,480
more successful while you build the

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,159
project

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,000
one of the areas that we're specifically

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,799
trying to improve in the short term is

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,520
to adopt

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,360
an open source roadmap process this is a

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,720
process created in the jenkins community

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,559
and why does it matter

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,760
oh this is a roll-up plan oops i went

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,520
too far yeah

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,640
so we're trying to adopt this process

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,400
that was created in the jenkins

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,720
community that will allow us to present

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,840
you

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,559
with clearly scoped issues that are

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,600
codified and get and tied to specific

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,159
strategic

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,640
priorities set by the steering committee

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,960
to

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,720
help you see how you can contribute and

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,240
how those contributions matter why do

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,000
they matter to the project in the big

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,720
picture and what what's the story behind

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
them

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,120
there is a news there's a session about

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,480
the open source roadmap planning

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,760
in the november 11th on november 11th as

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,280
part of the gardening days

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,120
so check that out on the spinnaker

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,440
summit schedule and please join us for

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,400
that

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,679
on the kiko platform an exciting

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
development this year

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,520
for spinnaker has been our launch of

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,400
spinnaker gardening days

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,080
so this event is has been organized by

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,240
armory in collaboration with the

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,840
community and partners like aws and

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,760
salesforce and of course

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,880
the continuous continuous delivery

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,320
foundation

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
if you would like to get started as a

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,120
contributor in a nurturing

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,559
and fun environment with a cohort of

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,400
others who are kind of going through the

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,200
same thing and exploring the project

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,280
these events are an awesome way awesome

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,520
opportunity for you to do that and also

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,200
earn prizes and rewards and recognition

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,799
while while you're doing it we're

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,679
currently in the middle of our third

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,240
gardening days

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,600
of 2020 the the summit gardening days

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,600
and i'm sure that will offer more of

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,679
these events in 2021

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,520
all right so

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,200
i want to get back to gardening and my

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,520
metaphor for just a second

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,880
and also to the work and the input that

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,039
the project needs from

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
all of you and all of us to grow and

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,080
thrive

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,360
so netflix and google have planted the

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,880
seas and they've done the early

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,120
nurturing of the project

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,240
companies like armory and ops mx have

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,320
come along to add

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,440
expertise and also to be the voice of

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,679
the enterprise

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,520
in the project to make sure that it can

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,960
meet the use cases that we see in the

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,279
marketplace

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,320
but the voices that we still need many

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,799
many more of

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,799
are your voices so we're looking for

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,480
more people who work in all kinds of

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,640
companies and different roles that touch

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,400
the software development life cycle

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,760
and with different backgrounds and

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,320
diverse perspectives

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,000
that will help elevate uh that we can

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
elevate in the project and that will

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,400
elevate the project

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,200
and i believe only then will the project

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,960
really reach its true potential

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
when the voice of the customer and the

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,640
voice of the user developer becomes a

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,559
bigger part of the product

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,799
and the decision-making process around

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,799
it so this is an opportunity for you to

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,159
build your career and establish a public

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,480
profile that supports

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,200
your company's success but is also

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,679
something that

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,279
you own and you can carry with you as

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,159
your career progresses it's super

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,760
powerful

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,360
the relationships and connections that

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,840
you develop the impressions that you

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
make

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,440
that can help you attract opportunities

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,200
it can help you get help and find

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,440
collaborators when you need them

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,279
and bring a lot of worthwhile value to

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,320
your professional profile

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,440
it's not easy but for those who have

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,760
made their careers

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,600
on their impact to open source or who

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,640
have brought their knowledge of an open

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,400
source ecosystem

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,400
to their company and used it to make

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,679
transformational change this is totally

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,159
worth it

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,880
now lastly i want to wrap up by talking

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,880
a little bit about why i care about this

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,240
i believe that software has the power to

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,400
change the world

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,520
software is one of the best and the

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,880
fastest ways to

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,360
influence people to change their

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,600
behaviors habits and routines

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,919
it has already shown a remarkable

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,880
ability to transform our societies and

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,720
we're not even

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,360
that good at building it yet i mean we

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,120
are but those of us in devops know

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,039
how much better it is going to get and

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,720
how much better software could be

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,640
so if you can help people change their

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,120
behaviors their habits and routines in a

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,480
low friction way then you can ultimately

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,799
you have the ability to

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,960
influence their beliefs too and we've

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,760
seen this a lot with social media

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,360
all over the world for example and when

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
you think about the problems that we

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,960
face

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,760
as a global species climate change

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,880
economic in sustainability and

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,480
destabilization the pandemic that's

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,440
currently happening

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,520
justice and public safety getting people

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,960
to change their behaviors

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,799
habits routines and their beliefs

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,720
this is going to be a huge part of any

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,559
solution for any of these problems

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,480
there's no way that technology will not

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,120
play a role and this is scary

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,039
like many people feel really worried and

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,799
are afraid of the danger that technology

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,600
poses in this way

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,200
the way i look at it that means that

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,120
those of us who are already working in

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,679
technology and especially those of us

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,159
who are

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,159
literally deciding how software gets

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,720
made we have an incredible

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,400
responsibility the only way that we can

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,360
be part of these solutions in a way that

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,520
actually works

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,760
that is sustainable that's human that

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,039
confronts its bias and represents our

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,039
species

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,559
is to make sure that we have adequate

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,240
representation

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,000
in these spaces where we're building

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,760
solutions we we need

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,360
all the ingenuity we need all the

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,080
perspective and all the productive

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,559
conflict

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,600
all the checks and balances that diverse

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,679
voices bring

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,880
otherwise we're going to fail we're

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,000
going to build solutions that don't

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,640
solve the problems or

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,039
that make the problems much worse i

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
believe

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,799
it's our responsibility to do the work

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,480
to build an equitable space where

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,720
software can be made

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,720
if we do that we have the potential to

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,679
share resources equitably through

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,840
technology

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,720
to find solutions that don't come with

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,799
trade-offs

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,559
and to envision and enact the future in

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,080
a way that we can barely imagine

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,720
now in 2020. so i ask you

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,480
don't give up we can do this and when i

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,399
say we can do this i don't mean

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
we can do spinnaker kelsey hightower

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,799
always always cautions me against

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,720
getting too tied to a particular tool a

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,799
particular ecosystem or community

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,559
because tools change technologies change

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,440
and evolve so what we really need to

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,200
focus on

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,559
are the people who make those

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,480
technologies possible

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,960
the people who make these collaborations

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,600
possible and we can stay connected as

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,559
as people as projects evolve and come

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,440
and go

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,000
so i think we can do this i think we can

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,960
only do

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,080
this together help us build and sustain

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,399
a true round

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,080
table that transcends spinnaker and that

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,600
will help us change the course of

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,919
history through software

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,760
i want to do it and i know you do too

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,600
thanks for joining me today and

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,600
reach out if you need any help as a

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,840
spinnaker contributor
