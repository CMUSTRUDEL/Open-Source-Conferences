Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	This panel will focus on how to integrate custom job stages into Spinnaker that will run jobs onto Kubernetes clusters. This is a common ask and a popular pipeline stage as it allows for many custom/out-of-band solutions to diverse problems. Some examples include running custom scripts or jobs after a bake or deploy stage. We will first start with why custom job stages will prove useful, then deep dive into how to set this up locally, and then introduce tricks and tips on how to get the most of the pipeline. Audiences can walk away understanding more about the internals of Kubernetes as well as Spinnaker, and ideas on what they can accomplish with their all inclusive, automated, pipeline.
