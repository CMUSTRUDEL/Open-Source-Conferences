Title: Evolution of Continuous Product Discovery - Ehab Bandar
Publication date: 2021-01-28
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	Modern product discovery is the result of a series of innovations, from the agile manifesto and user experience design to the lean startup and design thinking. All provide the essential toolkits to enable continuous product discovery, the root of progressive delivery. The presentation will provide a rapid-fire run through of these trends, what they accomplished, and why each incrementally built the current product discovery approach. It will provide examples of effective product discovery in the industry, as well as speculate on the future, how advanced controls and targeting is the critical success factor for designers and product managers. It will also chart out the impacts of AI and machine learning on how designers and experience architects deliver solutions that get results.

[Music]

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,720
hi everyone

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,880
my name is ehab bandar talking to you

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,160
today from oakland california

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
and i'm talking to you today about

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,360
product discovery an area that i'm

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
super excited about um

00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,960
[Music]

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,519
why does product discovery matter um

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
i'll be sharing some of its evolution

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,800
where we're at today

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,679
and i'll be sharing some tips and

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,719
principles that your team can apply

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,320
to build better products and do product

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,360
discovery in a better way

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,680
so without further ado let me share my

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
screen

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,440
so a little bit about me

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,520
i'm founder of bigtable we're an

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,879
experienced uh focused digital

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,239
consultancy

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:59,120
um focused really around design thinking

00:00:52,239 --> 00:01:02,079
um agile and product discovery

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,000
so what is product discovery um let me

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
just back up a little bit and talk about

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960
sort of what

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,360
is software development in general and

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,560
what's the goal of software development

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
and uh really for me it boils down to

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,280
finding and building products that

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,960
customers will love as soon as possible

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,040
so this goes hand in hand with product

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,400
discovery and product delivery

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,240
um really the distinction

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
between product discovery and delivery

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,119
while they happen very often

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
simultaneously

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,240
is that product discovery is really

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,960
looking to

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,759
uh find the product to build what to

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,720
build

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,759
through customer interviews through

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,920
market fits for opportunity evaluations

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
and experimentation wireless product

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,479
delivery is looking to build

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
uh that thing as fast as quickly as

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,960
possible

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,000
and as high quality as possible

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,560
at the end of the day we're both um both

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,439
phases

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
are involved in the creation process and

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,680
as michael

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,000
cusumano um so aptly puts it we're in

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,239
the

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,440
invention uh game we are building

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,599
tools applications that

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,599
meet a certain job of the customer

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,000
so the evolution of discovery is really

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,599
an evolution of learning it's really the

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,200
evolution from static

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,080
to dynamic from fixed to organic from

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,840
a viable product to a product that we

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
all love

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,599
and there's a bit a bunch of humility in

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
it going from

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,680
we know everything to we're not sure uh

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,360
let's test it out so that in a nutshell

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
is sort of a product discovery

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,959
uh very quickly i'm going to talk about

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,319
the sort of the origins

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,319
um of of discovery um

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,920
we have to talk about waterfall which is

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,040
sort of the most idealistic and

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,280
simplistic

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,720
approach which is the way manufacturing

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
and legacy software was built and until

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,599
the 1980s that was the

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,440
primary method for building applications

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,120
uh even as late as the launch of windows

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,360
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,720
it was strictly a waterfall process

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
where you have very discreet

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,040
phases you have a single big release and

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,040
often discovery and design

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,879
precedes everything else and has done it

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,799
one at the earliest point and not done

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,159
afterwards

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,280
but then over time we see uh a different

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,720
approach to that a sort of uh

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
um some alternatives to that waterfall

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,319
method

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,760
and in 1985 tom gilb uh computer

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,200
scientist introduced the idea of an

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,519
evolutionary delivery

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,799
and here you can see hints of the agile

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,440
where you have build measure

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
feedback loop built in and this was

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,720
really

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,400
an evolution of the incremental delivery

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,159
practice that was being preached but

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,360
still not quite adopted

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,720
um in its in its current form so this

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,080
was sort of the first

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,879
attempt at countering the the waterfall

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,599
sort of iterative uh step-by-step model

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,360
into much more of a sort of an organic

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,959
incremental approach then in the 1990s a

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,720
lot of people started rethinking

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,680
waterfall in a more serious way

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
the idealism of waterfall kind of was

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
hitting against

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,759
a lot of product fails and the reality

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,600
of a complex environment that software

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,720
operates in

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,680
so uh the the the main things that

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
um uh it ran up acro across was that

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
users rarely knew

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,400
what they wanted so you would ask them

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
they would tell you one thing

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,440
um but it wasn't the full picture and

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,280
then

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
even during implementation the

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,759
requirements would often

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,280
uh change or you'd uncover new

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,800
requirements that you weren't didn't

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,440
anticipate in the beginning

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,720
um and then the reality of any any

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
project any

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,639
complex product with a lot of unknowns

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,039
uh there are a lot of factors that lead

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,680
to changing requirements

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,280
so we saw um quite a bit of rethinking

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
this was sort of best expressed in the

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,039
extreme programming of kent beck

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,120
where he introduced this idea of

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
accountability for programmers making

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
sure that they can build

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,199
functional programs in a shorter shorter

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,479
amount of time

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
a really almost like a proof of concept

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,000
and here

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,759
you see elements of agile in the

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,759
uh in the approach of three-week

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,880
increments user stories acceptance

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,560
criterias

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,240
and really test driven development

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,400
ensuring that what gets filled

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
can be tested in front of users and here

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
we see kind of

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,400
the the surest signs that um

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,080
while it didn't explicitly talk about

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,120
discovery there was

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,880
quite a bit of of discovery

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
in these uh in these three week

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,039
increments that

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
um would would result in changes to the

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,280
to the plan

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,120
to the original plan that was uh

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360
conceived

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,400
again still it's in its infancy but

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,400
there was a

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,400
among programmers at least there was a

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,479
there was a bit of humility

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,560
um and i think it's best expressed in

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
this kent beck quote which is

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,479
which states that optimism is an

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,960
occupational hazard programming

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,639
feedback is the treatment um so this was

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,600
a very big step forward in

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,199
in the in the humility quotient uh that

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
i that i like to talk about

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,400
uh in that we don't know what we don't

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,160
know

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,919
and then in 2001 um about 17

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,520
of the leading computer scientists and

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,720
thought leaders uh

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,919
really had a sort of um a coming of the

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
coming of the minds

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,039
and really a call to action against

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,560
waterfall

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,039
it was a very strong statement in the

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,319
agile manifesto

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,240
expressing very simple but very

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,759
ideals that now we take for granted

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
which is you

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,039
value people over process you have

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,639
uh working software is that is the

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,039
ultimate metric

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,440
um and most importantly for the product

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,680
discovery realm that we're talking about

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,880
it's the emphasis on customer

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
collaboration

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,759
um and the agility to to respond to

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,919
changing feedback

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,840
so this was a very key milestone in

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,199
2001.

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,400
um at the same time

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,080
we have a more of a design driven more

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,720
of a user center driven

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,080
uh methodology and best embodied in the

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,039
design thinking

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,960
that was popularized by idl and apple uh

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,199
where they start with the empathy

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,240
uh and really try to walk and walk in

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
the

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
the customer's shoes try to understand

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
their needs

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
and go from there to building prototypes

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
and prioritizing their needs

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,479
and really testing out concepts through

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
that different lens where you're

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
you're trying to come up with

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,599
requirements from the inside rather than

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,520
from the outside in

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:58,240
um but it was still

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,240
a kind of a rough outline of how you

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,039
approach discovery it wasn't systematic

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,120
it wasn't

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,240
quantitative uh it was very much

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,360
heuristic and

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,680
as we uh as i've noted here um

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,479
heuristic uh from the root word uh

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,919
purest kind

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,879
is a is a really means to discover

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,840
and it's a an effort to come up with

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,720
what those

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,440
what the what people do need um and this

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,319
is sort of a

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,879
loose framework for for that effort

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,479
and then in 2008 uh consulted by the

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,159
name of tony olewick

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,919
really tries tried to systemize um

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,240
the discovery process through a

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,680
framework that he called jobs to be done

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,959
and this really goes back to translating

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,120
um needs into jobs

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,160
that you can fulfill you can prioritize

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,440
you can uh

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,120
you can estimate their satisfaction

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
level and the importance level

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,399
of those jobs that people want to

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,800
accomplish

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,720
one of the revelations in this is that

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,839
there was a greater emphasis on talking

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,399
with the customer

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,560
and really systemizing the the analysis

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,560
and design of the product strategy based

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,880
on those jobs to be done

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
so um this was this was a big step

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
forward

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,160
um that that really kind of tried to

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,560
uh create a uh a system that uh

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,040
can be easily followed with enough

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,040
research

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,240
and then in 2011 came eric reese and his

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
lean startup so barring a lot of the

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,600
discovery methods

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
and the approach of manufacturing and

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,720
even construction management

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,480
uh this idea of um

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,519
learn build uh and and and

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,200
revise based on that feedback um

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,320
it was a one of the the key

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,480
um the key sort of messages

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
was to really go for the minimum viable

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,160
product to do

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
just enough to get that feedback to get

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,360
that validation to take the next step

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,959
forward so this was a big um

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,120
kind of concept that a lot of people

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,399
gravitated towards and that discovery

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,920
was trying to

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,959
uh pursue um and the

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,839
the the general approach was a

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,880
very science uh scientific based

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,160
hypothesis

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,160
uh based approach to evaluating

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,640
uh ideas and either dismissing them

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,920
or doubling down and going forward with

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,040
those ideas

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,120
um one of the other big um

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,519
kind of benefits of this approach was

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
this idea of startups being a learning

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,160
machine

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,600
that we're in the business of learning

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,640
to innovate to

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,959
to take that next step um so this was a

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,240
very uh key um milestone in terms of how

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,560
both both the um strategy

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,839
the discovery and the delivery uh would

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,839
happen in unison

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,640
and the other part of lean was this very

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,279
tacit

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,320
um understanding that we don't know what

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,120
we don't know

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,000
and that the problems are really unknown

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,120
and that the the

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,800
way to get there is through um discovery

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
and delivery of that mvp

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,200
to get real customer feedback in the

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,200
real world

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,800
and then finally in 2016 we see the the

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,920
introduction of design sprints

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,519
uh by jake knapp uh at google x and this

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,760
was really trying to meld

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,440
both the the language of engineering and

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,680
sprints and time boxing

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,720
with the language of design and

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,720
prototyping and collaboration

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
and it was also another reflection of

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,240
designers feeling sort of left out

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
of the process of researchers feeling

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,800
left out of the process

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,320
and it was a systematic way to get

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,560
designers to design

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,160
to get collaborators to collaborate in a

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,480
very time-boxed way

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,480
and most importantly at the end of the

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,760
the process to come up with a prototype

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
that they could actually validate with

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,720
real people

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,120
based on their collaboration for that

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,360
previous uh five days of collaboration

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,680
so this is a great tool for sort of

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,680
rapid prototyping it was used for google

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,040
glass it was used for a bunch of

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,000
different efforts

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,839
to really get quick feedback to um to

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,279
get to that mvp

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,959
effort so that's kind of the in a

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,680
nutshell the history um

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,320
of product discovery as you can see here

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,160
uh

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
they're all they're all fads they're

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,959
trends that that have that have

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,000
um that peak and go away uh extreme

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,040
programming had its

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
uh had its heyday in 2005. uh you have

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,920
lean startup nowadays

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,959
um but i think the winner by far and so

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,200
if we add design thinking to the mix

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,120
it uh it definitely tops the the

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,720
mindshare quotient and is still very

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,720
prevalent today

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
around the discovery approach

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,440
so in a nutshell you could really

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,600
talk about discovery as iteration

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,880
iteration iteration do overdo over

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,560
do-over

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,959
until you find that product that you

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,959
want to build

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,320
it's also important to kind of keep in

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,560
mind some principles

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,079
because methods do change the principles

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,680
i think are the things that can

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,480
drive um a lot of teams to

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,760
to to pick and choose which method uh

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,800
works for them

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,680
um and which uh approach would work for

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,800
them based on their type of project

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,560
and their type of need so the first

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,880
principle i want to talk about is

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,079
probably my favorite one so there's a

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,920
term there's a concept

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,720
in economics called revealed versus

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,760
stated preference it's the idea that

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,480
uh people never know what they really

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,880
want

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,760
uh and what they tell you they want is

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,199
often not what they

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,880
what what they want um so

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,720
i think it's best captured in this quote

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,399
by jeff bezos

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,079
when he says that no customer ever asks

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,680
for prime membership program

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,279
but it turns out that they really wanted

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,560
it and

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,680
the reveal preference happens through

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
actually putting it out to the world um

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,079
and

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,680
this is why i really like continuous

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,880
delivery and progressive delivery

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,360
is you can find these nuggets of gems uh

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,720
that that work that don't work um

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,959
through actual

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,600
um feedback from from real usage

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,320
the second principle um which just

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,120
hinted at

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,480
is this idea of prototyping to de-risk

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,440
your idea

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,839
and to really show either investor

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,040
stakeholders

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,720
leadership of where you're heading and

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,680
where you're thinking so in this example

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,959
this picture

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,480
here shows tesla's roadster first

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,240
generation

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,160
so before it was even production ready

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,279
you can see in the top right what they

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,240
call their their

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,720
their test mule is really a frankenstein

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,959
of car

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,720
parts just to make it work just to

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
convey the idea of what they're going

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,399
after

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,120
um and this eventually uh led them to to

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,760
another

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,639
a big round of funding to to get that

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
next step

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,079
but it also built a lot of energy and

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,320
excitement um

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,199
and a lot of teams for a lot of teams

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
this kind of

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
uh effort this kind of validation will

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,639
keep them going so this is another

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,120
important lesson for discovery

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,800
is you want those small wins that that

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
keep you going to keep you

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,399
uh part of that mission that bigger

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,240
mission that you that you're there for

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,240
to try to uncover those uh

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,680
those those innovations

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,639
principle number three um is really

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,600
about

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,160
um creating that sort of that that

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,320
vision

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,680
that big problem that you're trying to

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,759
solve

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,000
in the jobs to be done framework there's

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,240
really two types of discoveries

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,680
the first is understanding what the

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,240
market opportunity is

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,759
what that problem you're trying to solve

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,800
and the second part of discovery is what

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,480
that product will look like and

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,160
this is really this principle is really

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,160
talking about that first piece

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,920
identifying what that mission is what

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,360
that opportunity is what the problem

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,000
that you're trying to solve

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,680
uh to help align the team in the right

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,639
direction so you're not constantly

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,519
weaving and

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,959
turning to to try to get to your um to

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,759
your destination so everybody's on the

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,160
same page

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,880
everyone has the same very concrete goal

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,880
that they're after

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,440
this principle i almost called the slide

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:43,040
um test test and retest

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,160
and it really speaks to the the really

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,519
evidence-based research that we have

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,920
around

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,639
more testing more modeling more

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,240
prototyping generates better ideas

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:59,519
and in this research ethan malik

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,639
did a research of bing.com

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,640
their a b testing and uncovered that

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,039
the top two percent of the ideas were

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,880
responsible for almost 75 percent

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,679
of the gains and this really goes to

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,640
show you in a very quantitative way

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,959
the need to generate more ideas more

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,679
prototyping more research up front

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,400
to really identify what those those gems

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,360
are

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,039
um so that you're you're uh tackling the

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,079
right products and not wasting

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,600
um uh people's time and energy

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,600
on things that aren't gonna give you

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,320
that that that value to the

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,320
to the end user

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,760
and number five um so palantir has this

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,080
concept

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,400
of forward-deployed engineers so they

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,039
don't have a sales team they really have

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
engineers that are forwardly deployed um

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,480
with the customer

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,520
to really live and breathe what they

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,559
live

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,720
what their work day is like and this

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,919
this really helps uncover those needs

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,880
from the inside out

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,760
rather than the outside end and every

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,840
discovery

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,520
uh modern discovery modern product

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,960
discovery is all about

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,200
being in constant contact with the

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,679
customer never never losing sight of

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,919
that

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
and making sure your teams are also in

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,880
constant

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,120
contact with the customer to really

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,919
understand the nuances

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,520
so not just preaching empathy but really

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,120
really practicing empathy

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,160
and really living in their shoes and

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:30,880
understanding their needs day to day

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,080
six is um one of my favorites if you're

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,080
a nasim talib

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,760
uh fan you'll you'll appreciate skin in

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
the game um

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,880
but you really want to focus on a

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
cross-functional team

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,520
part as part of your discovery that

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,280
really has a vested interest

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,640
in the outcome of what they're working

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,200
on um

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,960
and is incentivized in the right way so

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,039
this is this ghostbusters

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,640
uh team if you're familiar with the

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,720
movie

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,320
if they do their job right they will get

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,320
rewarded and get more business

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,000
if they don't do their job right they

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,880
will get slimed if you're familiar with

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,200
that movie

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,440
and so they have an incentive to do well

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,400
to be creative to understand the market

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,679
to understand

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,039
what their what their job is and so

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,480
um this is kind of the the principle of

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,000
skin in the game cross functionality uh

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,480
really goes a long way when you're

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,960
trying to uncover needs and customer

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,640
needs

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,640
and trying to do the best job possible

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,240
and the last few principles are really a

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,440
mindset culture

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,280
that we try to instill and it's

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,160
especially relevant in product discovery

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,000
which is a very creative process

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,200
and to assemble a curiosity mindset not

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,799
just to preach

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,880
uh you know it's okay to fail it goes

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,480
beyond preaching it really

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,480
you want team members who have this sort

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,320
of continuous learning mindset

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,840
who can grind it out because there's a

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,480
lot of grind uh

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,440
who believe in the mission and who are

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,360
curious about

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,480
uncovering um uncovering

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,960
gems insights about the customers uh and

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,799
this is not a common trait unfortunately

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,200
um but um you know as as gusto i like

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,480
gusto is just is just an amazing company

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,679
for for this sort of curiosity

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,520
and their their co-founder was quoted as

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,280
saying celebrate what you don't know and

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,840
this is really a cultural

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,280
uh aspect that i think can go a long way

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,280
uh to help provide discovery

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,919
and uh principle number eight is really

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,320
to keep in mind some of the earlier

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,799
stuff about the north star the vision

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
is to really work towards what you're

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,320
after

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,520
and not to optimize for the short-term

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,720
gains

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,760
this is again starts at the top uh but

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,200
it really

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,280
uh it's a is a way to reorient towards

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,240
what's really important

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,320
for the project and not to just optimize

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,919
on speed and releases and shipping

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,159
but to really work through some of the

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,880
hard problems to get to that longer term

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,480
vision that

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,400
that we're after uh in discovery

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,559
and uh principle nine is something that

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
we we quickly lose sight especially when

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,600
we talk about we're trying to

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,600
figure out what the right feature sets

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,919
are and what the right uh

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,600
what the right user stories are it's

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,440
really emphasizing

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,840
experience anticipating what the

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,919
customer needs are in the future

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,960
and really optimizing on the light

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,159
there's a recent quote by tony fidel who

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,960
was the creator of ipod uh helped

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,320
and created nest and was a big part of

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,440
the iphone

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,200
project he was very upfront and he was

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,679
very candid that that said he

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,520
you know they were anticipating um they

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,440
they knew that customers

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,039
wanted uh a thousand songs in their

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,480
pocket but then they realized that

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
customers wanted everything in their

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,280
pocket

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:03,120
and then rather than try to um

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,880
you know look away they realized that

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,880
to cannibalize themselves or somebody

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,520
else is going to cannibalize them

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,520
and so the iphone the sort of the

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,520
genesis of the iphone

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,880
came to be and that's what accelerated

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,880
its development at that point

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,039
and last but not least is principle 10

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,960
which is really an aggregation of all

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,200
the principles it's really to apply

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,240
those principles into your organization

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,280
as ralph waldo emerson uh so so

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,280
uh well adequately uh states it

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,440
he says as to methods there are maybe

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,679
there may be a million and then some but

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
principles are few the man who grasps

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,120
principles

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,799
consists of successfully select his own

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,000
methods

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,480
and this goes back to that methods and

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,039
toolkits come and go but what's really

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,039
important

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,520
is following the principles that that

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,200
work well with your organization

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,760
uh some of the best companies that do

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,080
that are like amazon who have their 14

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,120
principles that every decision has to be

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,080
aligned with

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,480
um and i think this goes goes a long way

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
to

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,480
building that sort of discovery

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,520
innovation mindset

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,640
that a lot of teams are looking for so

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,320
just to summarize

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,080
um where we're at with product discovery

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,480
we've moved from a sort of a static

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,159
model to more of a continuous model

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,480
both in the discovery side and the

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,280
delivery side it's a very exciting time

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
in that

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,720
learning is central to both the

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,440
discovery and the delivery

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,880
uh to constantly keep making uh products

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,960
better and better

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,799
so with that i thank you for uh for your

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:45,440
time i appreciate your

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:45,440
