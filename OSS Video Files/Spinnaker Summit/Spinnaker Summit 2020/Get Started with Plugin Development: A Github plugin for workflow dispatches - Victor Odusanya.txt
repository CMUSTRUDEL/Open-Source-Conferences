Title: Get Started with Plugin Development: A Github plugin for workflow dispatches - Victor Odusanya
Publication date: 2020-12-17
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	This workshop from Spinnaker contributor Victor Odusanya looks to lower the barrier of entry to Spinnaker plugin development. It aims to show how extensible Spinnaker is and how mature the plugin framework is getting. This workshop includes a beginner-level coding session. We will create a Spinnaker Orca plugin to interact with the Github API to trigger workflow dispatches. 

The applications of a plugin to trigger workflow dispatches are quite open-ended, and this talk demonstrates how a custom Spinnaker integration would typically be approached. Tools to be used here include: (i) gradle, (i) kotlin, (iii) IntelliJ, (iv) Yarn, (v) Deck pluginsdk, (vi) Orca-api packages At the end of this workshop, we will have a working orca plugin and will attempt to make a dispatch to a workflow with this plugin.
