Description: 
	In this talk, AbdulBasit Kabir walks us through what a pipeline could look like in a hypothetical bank deploying multiple modern and legacy applications to VMs and Kubernetes.

Chef or Ansible? Kustomize, Helm, yaml, templates? Build environment version, quality gates level, manual approvals, security scans, regression, blue-green, canary, registry & repositories. Which of these need to be in my Continuous Delivery (CD) workflow and how to implement? Now throwing in the need for compliance and high regulation, typical of financial institutions, to the mix makes you wonder how CD is implemented in highly regulated environments like banks.
