Description: 
	The world of deployments is a complex pool of pods, pipelines and platforms. At Pinterest, we have the added complexity of scale - hundreds of services working together to provide inspiring content for 400 million monthly active users. Recently, we've averaged around 800 daily deployments by Spinnaker. Since adopting Spinnaker, we've found that our engineers and service owners want the benefits of Spinnaker without the added complexity and overhead. So in this talk, Tobi & Lise will introduce Hermez Pipelines - a beautiful abstraction built on top of Spinnaker that brings canonical deploy pipelines to Pinterest. Come to this talk to learn why we picked this option, how Hermez Pipelines helps us reach our goals, why we donâ€™t expose Spinnaker UI to our engineers, why you should do the same, and why UX matters more than you might think.
