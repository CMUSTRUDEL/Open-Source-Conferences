hello spinnaker summit

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,639
my name is chris deland from netflix and

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,840
i'm one of the co-leads

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,240
of the ui sig my other co-lead

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,400
noah linski from armory recent recently

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,359
stepped up as a sig lead so

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,359
much thanks to noah

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,640
let's talk a bit about the purpose of

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,920
the uic

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,199
we noted four different purposes one

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,800
is a community forum for discussing ui

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,920
ux and spinnaker two is to demo

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,200
upcoming features or customizations to

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,160
the deck the spinnaker ui deck

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,360
three is to provide guidance and

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,719
feedback

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,399
for people building on top of the deck

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,760
ui

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:59,440
and four is simply to do issue triage

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,680
for strictly ui based issues

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,159
so one of the main purposes of the ui

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,960
sig is to provide a community forum

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,000
to discuss the spinnaker ui and the ux

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,840
they're in

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,040
this could be community feedback on

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
recent ui changes it could be a proposal

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
to make

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,040
a change to spinnaker ui or discussions

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,360
about the design and implementation of

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,360
deck

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,439
here's an example of a sig discussion

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,040
that turned into a deck pr

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,799
earlier this year this pr adds

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
breadcrumbs to the pipelines view

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,439
showing upstream parent executions

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,439
that invoked downstream execution

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,920
the ui sig often has demos of upcoming

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,840
spinnaker ui features

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,920
we invite the community to see what is

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,399
planned and to provide us with feedback

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,840
and discussion

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,759
here's a sampling of some features that

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,040
were demoed at the ui sig

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,079
and later became actual uh feature of

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,759
spinnaker or

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:08,239
is in process managed delivery is a

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:11,520
great example

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,680
fantastic vertical nav that

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,160
changes the layout of spinnaker i think

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,160
as of

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,760
1.21.19 perhaps

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,319
and the ci view which is in process of

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,319
coming to open source

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,239
and of course we are also happy to

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,840
provide guidance and feedback around ui

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,959
implementations we had a fantastic

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,080
discussion

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,599
on a proposal to add aws

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,879
spot pricing to the aws cloud provider

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:52,319
this is a pretty major enhancement to

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,319
the instance type selector for aws

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,239
any and all ui ux questions are welcome

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,959
we generally have the time at the end of

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,000
our session

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,879
for ad hoc discussions

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,159
in addition to demos of upcoming course

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,640
spinnaker features

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,640
we also act as a showcase for community

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,400
ui customizations

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,159
various companies are doing really

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,760
interesting things to extend the

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
spinnaker ui

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
inside their companies and this is a

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,040
great place to show off that work

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,720
we're excited that the community is

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,680
extending spinnaker

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,560
so please drop by and demo your work if

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,440
you have it

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
as an example airbnb demoed their

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,400
snapshots ui

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,640
which is an entirely new tab in

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,440
spinnaker ui that tells them

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,360
which snapshots are currently deployed

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,799
in each environment and which pipelines

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
deployed them

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
and of course we're always happy to

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,480
provide feedback

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,480
on these internal customizations also

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,400
finally we do basic issue triaging

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,640
in this in the ui seg this means

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
making sure that tickets are noticed are

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,319
labeled correctly

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,319
and are put into the appropriate buckets

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
looking forward here are some of the

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,319
things

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,120
on the ui sigs radar

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,120
the upcoming facelift for drawers and

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,240
navigation

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,320
this facelift is made possible by the

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,040
recent vertical nav changes

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,720
that were previously mentioned we are

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
identifying a set of components to

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,680
publish

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
in the spinnaker component library for

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,840
plugins

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,600
and other customizations as a

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,280
as a customizer deciding which

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,680
components to use

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,040
or deciding to write your own components

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
can be challenging

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,440
choice when enhancing the ui we hope

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,600
this library will act as a clear

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,000
indicator of which ui components

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,720
are modern supported and should be used

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
to compose a new ui in spinnaker

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,759
to document this we plan to use

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,160
storybook

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,680
we have a modest start at documenting

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,280
the spinnaker form system

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,479
at this point in addition

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,759
we're tracking the continued payment

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,120
down of technical debt in the deck ui

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
and modernization of dec there's a long

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
tale

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,680
of angular to react migration we

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
continue to make progress

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
migrating our ui code from angularjs to

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,759
react

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,479
however it's a long process we hope to

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,600
whittle

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,639
eventually spinnaker core down to pure

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,880
react

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,000
with a sprinkling of adapters for some

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,080
angularjs implementations

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,759
if you'd like to learn more about tech

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
debt and our plans to

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
pay it down there's a document called

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,360
deck as a platform

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,520
which is shared with the community this

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,800
document tracks a long list of tech data

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,720
in spinnaker ui

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,479
and the possible plans for paying that

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,720
tech debt off

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,000
if you'd like to have access to this doc

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,440
just hop over

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
