Description: 
	tasked by our leadership team to create a sustainable CI/CD service that will be operated by Site ReliabIlity Engineering teams and reused on any development project. We embarked on that journey, selecting Spinnaker as our central Continuous Delivery service and working on a multi-tenant deployment that would allow us to onboard users, provide managed delivery services and improve speed and agility for cloud delivery projects. In this talk we go over the business motivations for building a multi-tenant Continuous Delivery Service based on Spinnaker, the benefits it brings to development projects and the challenges that we faced when implementing the solution.
