Title: UI Plugin Development - Daniel Peach
Publication date: 2021-01-28
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	Want to build a UI plugin for Spinnaker? This talk is for you! We’ll start with the basics: you’ll learn how to use the UI plugin scaffolding tool, set up a development environment, and build a simple UI for a new stage. From there, we’ll veer off course to explore the possible, the dangerous, and the impossible. You’ll learn how to create a UI for a new cloud provider and how to confuse your users by overriding components. For those who hate UIs but still need ‘em, we’ll discuss strategies for those who can’t stomach another line of JavaScript. This talk will include lots of examples and an enthusiastic presenter.
