Title: The Life & Death of Great American Cities: Urban city planning and OSS - Isaac Mosquera
Publication date: 2021-01-12
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	Surprisingly urban city planning has much in common with open source communities. We can learn from the failures and successes of decades of city planning in the United States. Cities and software care about the similar concerns: reliability, safety, transparency, resiliency, diversity and timeliness of delivery(i.e., transportation).  Weâ€™ll explore the learnings and connections between the two.

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
a year ago i picked up a book called

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,519
life and death

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,440
of american cities by jane jacobs it was

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,720
written in 1961 but i found it

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,160
fascinating to learn

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,760
that we're still influenced by

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,000
idealistic and naive

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,680
ideas that came out of london in the

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,640
early 1900s

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,599
you know back then london was quickly

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,240
becoming

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
overcrowded it had a lot of factories a

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,000
lot of pollution

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,120
and a lot of crime and poverty you know

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,399
citizens agreed

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
at that point in time that that was

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
their number one issue to take care of

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,280
was the overcrowding of london

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,520
and because the idea of planning for a

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,920
city didn't occur these ideas of cities

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,079
didn't exist until recently

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
there was a man named ebenezer hauer and

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,199
he came up with this idea of garden

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,760
cities

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,719
if we were only to give people a whole

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,800
bunch of nature

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,600
in space it would solve all of the

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,559
problems that the city of london had

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
now garden cities intended to be planned

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,960
self-contained communities

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,840
surrounded by these green belts contain

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,680
an appropriate portion of areas and

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,920
residencies in industry and agriculture

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,040
and you can see that in the diagram here

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,960
in this uh

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
in this circular diagram that came out

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,600
of ebenezer howard's book

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,040
in the center of the circular village

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,280
you'll have the gardens

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,759
as it were civic centers you'll have

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,000
where people will do their civic duties

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,280
you will also have fun and go out to the

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,240
opera

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
and then on the outskirts or the next

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
ring out

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,119
that is where the citizens would live

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,119
and so the citizens would go in either

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,960
of one of two directions either into the

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,840
civic center for nightlife

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,280
opera or to the outskirts of town where

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
they had a whole bunch of commercial

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,439
centers the industries

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,759
and so the idea would be that we would

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,960
push all the pollution to the outside of

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,040
these towns

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
the ideas for garden cities became so

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
popular

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,520
that it finally had reached the united

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
states and had influence

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,360
over many areas that we all know today

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
towns like

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,959
queens and new york hilton village in

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
new orleans

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,000
areas of chicago arlington virginia

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,520
right outside of dc where i spent a lot

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,599
of my formative years

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
and newport news of virginia there's

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,560
actually a town called garden city new

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
york

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,160
which did not bear his name from this

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,720
concept but still inherited

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000
some of the concepts of of howard's

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,319
thinking

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
now there's also other towns like norris

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,519
in tennessee

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,680
there's greendale wisconsin green hills

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
ohio and greenbelt maryland

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,319
which got its name from the literal

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,000
greenbelt center circled these towns

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,599
but there was a really big problem with

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,440
howard's design

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
because of the overcrowd and he thought

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,000
that he could just limit the size of

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
towns to

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,680
38 000 and it was super idealistic why

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
couldn't we just keep people to 38 000.

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
the problem with this is that most

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,760
cities in the world had already grown

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,519
much larger than 38 000 people so

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,159
there's no real way to actually

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
implement

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,920
a lot of his ideas now a man named

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
licker bossier came up with this idea to

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,599
take

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,440
what howard had built around nature and

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,040
spacing people out

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,800
and build on top of it and he called it

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
the radiant city

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,879
his idea was going to be to build these

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,879
gigantic skyscrapers that would take a

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,319
very small amount of land

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,720
uh horizontally but continue to have

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,440
greenery and the green belts and the

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,920
parks

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,000
all built around us in addition he would

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,560
continue to organize the city by

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,319
by segregating out the commercial areas

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
from the residential areas from the

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,120
industrial areas

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,599
building on howard's ideas so he would

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
also

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,840
take uh organize the families and

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,760
residential areas not by

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
income and social position but instead

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
by family size

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,599
and so they would be clearly separated

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,720
into their own neighborhoods and

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,080
very cleverly designed now while all of

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,159
this sounds great in practice

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
it has devastating effects in decades in

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,599
cities across the united states

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,439
i mean who doesn't like the idea of

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,760
nature and cleanliness

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,360
and order it sounds so perfect why

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,720
wouldn't we want that and why wouldn't

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
it just work

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,400
but the reality is is that cities don't

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,400
die on their own

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,240
buildings don't die on their own roads

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,440
don't die on their own

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,680
they die because of humans leaving

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,479
they die because of humans letting them

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
die

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,080
at the same time cities live

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,800
because humans breathe life into those

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,639
cities

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
and like any living organism it is not a

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,240
single cell that does the work

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
it is a complicated set of relationships

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,440
between the people

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,040
that determine its success and this is

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,639
what we call community

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,400
there's a lot of learning we can apply

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,680
from the failures of city planning in

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,479
our in our in our open source

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
communities

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,639
that we've already experienced in our

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,400
cities here in the united states

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,720
so why don't we take a second here to

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,800
dive into some of these problems

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,440
and how jane jacobs talked about fixing

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,120
them so first we'll talk about security

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,600
safety and defects

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,600
the first problem is is how safety is

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,919
actually accomplished in these cities

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
contrary to prop popular belief police

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,600
don't prevent crime

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,360
but aren't but are necessary it's

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,360
actually primarily done through social

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,400
norms standards and the culture of the

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,240
people themselves

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,840
who monitor the sidewalks in the streets

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
of these neighborhoods

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,120
when that culture is broken down there's

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,639
no amount of policing or guards that can

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
prevent that crime

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
it would be an enormous amount of money

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,919
and it just wouldn't work

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,600
in the decades following the 1900s we've

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,240
seen that an increase in police budgets

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,479
does not

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,320
have a proportional decrease in crime so

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,199
while social distancing is good for the

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,120
pandemic

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
spreading the population out the way

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
that like bossier

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
and howard suggested does not solve

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,479
security

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,320
if that was the case a city like los

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
angeles would be extremely safe

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,720
since it's basically a suburban-like

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
city everything is extremely safe at

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
this

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
spread out but we know that that isn't

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,360
the case

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,520
la still has crime and there are still

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,919
dangerous areas of la

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,600
now these were the fundamental flaws in

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,120
the radiant in the garden city

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
due to these overcrowded cities they

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,720
believe that just giving more space

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
individuals met more private privacy and

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,400
security but we know that something is

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,919
implicitly true

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,360
when you look at these two streets and

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,319
these slides you'll see that there is

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,000
one street

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,440
that is well lit and you'll see another

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,039
street that is well lit

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
but the main difference between one

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,720
street and the other street

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,240
is that one street is completely empty

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,120
and the other street has a bunch of

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,360
people

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,280
and we as humans inherently know to shy

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,080
away from that street that may be well

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
lit

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
and go towards the street that has a lot

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,360
of people so we also know that just

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,759
keeping streets

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
with well-lit lights does not deter

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,440
crime

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,240
but what we do know is that eyeballs on

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,520
these streets

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,319
and strangers yes strangers is actually

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,840
what keeps us our cities safe now your

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
parents don't want me to tell you that

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,759
but strangers do keep it safe because

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,680
that's what makes those alleyways and

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
sidewalks safe are the eyeballs of those

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,479
strangers

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
and as long as there's a strong sense of

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,720
standard social norms and cultures

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,199
on those streets and in those

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,599
neighborhoods that strangers actually

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
had to reinforce the culture and the

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,560
social norms

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
and the same could be said about open

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,440
source projects

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,520
if we want secure bugles products and

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,520
projects and communities we actually

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,800
need eyeballs just as much as those city

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
streets do

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
in fact one of the earliest open source

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,560
mantras was based on a concept in night

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,919
that was created in 1999

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,960
by eric s ramos raymond he created

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,720
linus's law

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,639
in the book he called the cathedral in

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
the bazaar that was created almost 20

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,840
years ago

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
and what he stated was given enough

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,639
eyeballs all

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,560
bugs are shallow you know and

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,240
coincidentally he referred to open

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
source projects as bazaars

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,080
or marketplaces things where the

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,240
community goes to exchange

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,520
so as i'm reading this book and making

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,639
the analogies to

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,319
uh to open source and city planning eric

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,560
raymond was doing the exact same thing

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,479
20 years ago and what he's really saying

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,919
is given enough contributors and users

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,840
looking at our projects

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
we'll be able to find all of the

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,639
security holes and gloves associated

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
with it

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,080
and if we're lucky enough we might have

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,280
a chance to fix them with the same group

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,080
of people

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,720
so if eyeballs are so important to both

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
cities and

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,120
open source communities how do we get

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,160
more eyeballs

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,760
so the first is clearly defining

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,719
private and public areas not just the

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
streets

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,760
but also the storefronts the buildings

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,599
we must know what is public and private

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
there can be no gray area

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,279
as there are in suburban neighborhoods

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,320
when you step onto someone's grass you

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,760
don't know whether it belongs to the

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,880
government or that grumpy old man that

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
lives inside

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
that's okay in a suburban area but it's

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
not okay for the city

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,839
because as strangers because those are

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,200
what we want to draw into our streets to

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,040
keep them safe

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,200
they want to know what they can interact

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,320
with without that clear demarcation

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,399
strangers will be left

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,000
unsure on how to interact with those

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,320
public spaces altogether

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,399
and not come to your neighborhood at all

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,320
in open source we have the same issue

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,399
and we are experiencing that today

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
we can equate this to private and public

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,560
spaces to the licenses

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,880
our open source technology uses the

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,920
licenses that we use in open source

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,760
whether it be the gpl or the apache

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
license it doesn't really matter

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,839
the important thing that matters that we

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,080
can clearly delineate or demarcate

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,000
what belongs to the private entity or

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,279
what belongs in public spaces

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
and we're seeing this play out with

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,600
google and oracle today

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,279
the main argument around public apis

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
definitions and its public's use will

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,160
define how we use open source

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,399
for time to come and enterprises

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,000
hate risk so when you def when you

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,720
cannot properly define

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
public or private spaces if you are

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,320
essentially

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,839
giving the enterprises risk and so

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,720
they'd rather not use your project

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,399
at all so just like in cities open

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,839
source needs clearly define

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,440
private and public spaces the next thing

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,560
we need for a good

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
city is skin in the game right we need

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,760
people

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,519
who care about that street we need

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
residents who care about it shop owners

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,320
who care about it because inherently a

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
shop owner

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,160
wants to keep their their streets safe

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,120
and clean and neighborhood safe and

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,360
clean

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
right they care about it it is their

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
well-being

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,160
is how they make their money the same

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,880
thing needs to be happening in open

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
source

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,480
like spinnaker and netflix netflix uses

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,480
spinnaker to deploy

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
their software thousands of times a day

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,640
they need it to be safe and secure

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,600
and needed to work well you know i work

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,640
at a company called

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,480
armory and we need the exact same thing

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,399
right we depend on the open source

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,800
community so we have skin in the game

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,839
like netflix and others and the reason

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
you need that is because

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,040
we are the ones who are going to start

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
defining those social norms

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,959
that these strangers who come by and see

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,600
our project and see our neighborhood

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,279
will also fall into and lastly we need

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,000
continuous use

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,920
nobody enjoys looking at an empty street

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,040
right if eyeballs are what we need to

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,880
keep us safe

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,640
then we need something to look at

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,680
otherwise we'll just go inside and turn

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,839
around

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,440
right consider the neighborhood or the

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
district of wall street in new york city

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,120
in the 60s

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,880
it was mostly a quiet place surprisingly

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,399
with the exception of nine to five

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,240
and even then it was fairly quiet

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,600
because people were in their offices

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,680
right they would go out for their lunch

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
time so from 12 to two you know

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
the commercial shops and the restaurants

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
would get these rushes but other than

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,240
that it was pretty quiet

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,079
and during those periods of times there

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,800
was a lot of crime uh

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,079
and poverty in those areas stores would

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
shut down and turn over

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,040
very very quickly because you didn't

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,800
know when the next customer was going to

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,120
come unless it was 12 to 2.

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,639
and it was a really sad story because if

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,519
you think about where wall street is in

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,680
new york

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,440
it's great it's right next to the harbor

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
and it's also right next to uh lady

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,519
liberty which is a great thing to look

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,399
at

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,360
and yet it still suffered from crime and

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,360
the reality

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,959
is that we just like other people we

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,120
like watching other people it's innate

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,399
in us it's human nature to be surrounded

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,240
by other people

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,920
and so in order to have eyeballs on your

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,079
city and on your project

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,760
you need to attract as many people as

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,399
possible

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
all right so now we know that we need to

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,279
attract as many people

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,920
as possible why don't we try to

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,680
understand why people join

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,680
communities now as i started digging

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,399
into the similarities between

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,320
open source and city planning chrissy

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,040
costa one of our investors suggested i

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
read this book

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,279
the making and maintenance of open

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,720
source software by nadia eggball

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,240
now if you haven't heard of this and

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
you're really interested in learning

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
more about

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,800
uh the research that she did while she

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,320
was at github i strongly suggest that

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,800
you grab this book

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,240
now she defined four major reasons why

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,000
people work on open source

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,000
number one they just want to solve a

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,240
problem interestingly enough

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,079
open source for most people is not an

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,160
end but a means to an end

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,279
right they are just trying to get their

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,800
work done and they

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,680
have reached a problem that they cannot

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,200
solve with existing solutions

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,279
the second reason why people work in

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,120
open source is reputation

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,120
you know if you look at masloff's uh

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,600
hierarchy of needs

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,519
number three down from the top is just

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,760
having peer recognition

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,680
and just the idea of having eyeballs on

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,800
you is something that we strive for as

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
humans as well

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,720
and because all of this is done in

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
public it's uh anybody because able to

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
see you and you can gain notoriety from

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
that and we've seen

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,399
a huge growth in this in the last 10

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,120
years

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,240
number three i feel like i belong here

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
now

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,839
this is really about the community and

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,480
the values that it holds and this one

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,320
particular speaks to me each open source

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,639
community has its own culture

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,720
how to prioritize its features its work

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,240
contributors types of events

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,320
and these are all the reasons i continue

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
to come back to the spinnaker community

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,760
and the last one and the most important

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,279
one is it's a lot of fun

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,360
if you're anything like myself i love

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,959
the code i actually use it as a break

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
from the day-to-day activities that i

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,760
have

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,279
and there are others who do as well

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,199
being able to tackle problems that are

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,639
outside of your domain are interesting

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,440
and challenging and fun

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,240
and people go gravitate towards that the

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,399
same

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,360
reasons why we gravitate towards open

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,160
source and use

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
uh open source can be said about why

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,920
people join cities

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
they have problems to solve i either

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,880
have i need a job opportunity i need a

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,720
better education

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,160
better living conditions i need to be

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
close to family

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
right all of these things are problems

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,040
that need to be solved and cities draw

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,720
us to that

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,639
the second which is the same as open

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
source is reputation

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
right if you want to be a fashion

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,360
designer you're likely going to spend

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,639
some time in milan

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,040
if you want to be a cook you're going to

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,079
spend some time in france in paris

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
if you want to be an actor you're going

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,800
to go to hollywood or la if you want to

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,760
be in finance

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,760
you'll go to new york city or london all

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,680
of these reasons or why people go there

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,199
is to build a reputation to

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,320
build their careers and of course

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,320
just like in open source the community

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,680
and just like that spoke to me about the

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,279
spinnaker community

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,519
when i first went to san francisco in

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,120
the early 2000s of course i was excited

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,399
about the career opportunities and the

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,920
job opportunities

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,000
but at that point in time i really felt

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,680
like san francisco was the city for me

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
based on their cultural values and what

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,279
they stood for

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,199
and the last one it's fun if you've ever

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,279
been to vegas miami or new orleans

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,279
you completely understand why you'd want

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,839
to move there as a young guy i wanted to

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,519
move to

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
miami it didn't make i didn't make that

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,880
happen but that's

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,880
one of the reasons why people go all

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,440
right so from there

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,880
let's talk about how we classify open

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,320
source projects

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,959
now this is important for us to

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,160
understand how open source projects are

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,320
created

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,440
and as i'm reading this book that was

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,839
suggested to me

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,519
nadia goes to describe how there are

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,160
different projects and what classifies

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
them

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,600
and i came to realize that not all of

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,240
the analogies that i'm making today

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,480
applies to

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,920
all open source projects so she says

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,920
that there are four types of projects

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
which are federations clubs stadiums and

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,639
toys

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,560
federations have high user growth high

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,759
contributor growth you can see this in

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,160
projects like linux

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,480
kubernetes and even spinnaker they

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,240
accommodate a ton of different use cases

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
and that is the analogies that i'm

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,320
making today

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,519
clubs are user have low user growth

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,399
relative to its high number of

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,120
contributors

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,880
for example astro pi now unless you're

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,320
an astrophysicist it's unlikely you're

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,240
going to use this project

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,680
but if you are an astrophysicist it's

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,759
likely you are going to contribute to

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,639
that project

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,560
stadiums have high user growth high user

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,199
growth but low contributor growth

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,480
and babel is a good example of this as

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,680
well as something like

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,800
open source uh sorry open open ssh

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,720
openssh is used by pretty much everybody

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,000
today and it's being used in your laptop

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
today if you're on a mac

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
but it's very unlikely that and you know

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,399
anybody who contributes to that

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,920
so we spinnaker are a federation and

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,639
this is why it's important to denote

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,240
that

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,319
it's also important because the

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,319
community means a lot to us because

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,000
we're an abstraction above the clouds

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,760
as the clouds continue to pour billions

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,360
of dollars in innovation

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,120
we also need to keep up with that

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,600
innovation and it's critical that we do

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,839
so and we rely on the community to do so

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,000
so next we think about governance now

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,720
for the most part

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,559
communities are actually self-governed

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,400
or have a light set of government

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,160
governance from the community itself or

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
or city hall

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,760
now as much as we want to try and

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,000
contain and organize cities and the way

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,120
that

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
howard and debossia did it's incredibly

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,400
hard to do so

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,600
and typically leads to undesirable

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,679
results

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,960
the idea of how we create neighborhoods

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,960
in new york city

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
is not somebody from the top but instead

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,760
how they self-organize to create those

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,039
neighborhoods

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,960
based on identity now uh

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,080
at the base of it all for governments we

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,520
have people

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,840
above that we have the neighborhoods

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,280
that they have selected themselves into

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,960
and above that we do have something

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,039
really important called districts

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,160
now the reason districts are so critical

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,840
to cities

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,520
is because districts are the way to

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,200
influence city hall

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
you know when they wanted to knock down

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,360
carnegie hall in new york city

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
the town or the the neighborhood where

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,480
carnegie hall existed

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,000
could not fight city hall on its own it

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,600
had to use the district power

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,919
to prevent carnegie hall to being

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,960
dropped and that's what we have

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,000
now on the open source side we have a

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,039
very similar

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,840
uh story we have

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,720
people who work on features those

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,679
features alone

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,280
are not enough to kind of move uh other

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,240
folks around so instead

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,160
we bubble those up into cigs those cigs

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,480
have more power and influence based on

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,080
who's running them in the community

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,919
so things like cross-cutting concerns

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,400
like security can be

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,400
brought up to the steering committee and

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,000
the toc

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,480
from there we go into diversity and

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,400
now that we've established uh why people

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,160
go and what keeps us safe

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,000
and how do we kind of get these cities

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,720
to to change

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,559
we go into what jane jacobs in her book

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,640
says is her central argument of the

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,160
of the entire book and it's about

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,840
diversity

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,080
the and she says that the ubiquitous

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,200
principle is so close-grain diversity of

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,240
uses that give

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,440
each other constant mutual support

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,720
both economically and socially and this

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
is really important

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
it's not just our diverse social

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,160
backgrounds

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,760
that need to be thought of although that

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,160
is critical as well

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,280
but also our differences in economic

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,120
backgrounds

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,320
from poor to rich from finance

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,400
uh to fashion a city needs to support

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,000
all of these diverse use cases so if we

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,160
go back to wall street one of the main

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,760
problems was this lack of diversity

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,760
there's one thing and one thing only you

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,880
went to wall street for and that was for

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,480
finance

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,000
you didn't go there for fashion you

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,240
didn't go there for food

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,640
you didn't go there for anything else

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,880
and so it suffered a really great

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,480
uh problem for a long period of time

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
until that change

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,840
you can also think about the way that

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,640
people use sidewalks right

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,400
sidewalks themselves need diverse uses

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,120
larger sidewalks are going to make way

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
for

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,720
kids playing wanting to jump rope

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,799
they're also going to make way for

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,960
people who may want to sell hot dogs

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,320
smaller sidewalks make use cases for

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
different reasons

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,159
you can also think about buildings you

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,120
need old buildings just as much as you

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,039
need all

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,640
new buildings new buildings are going to

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,000
be more expensive and attract different

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
types of use cases

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
old buildings are going to make way for

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,799
people who are not

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,400
as developments trying to start new

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,720
companies new businesses

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,679
and who can't afford those new buildings

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,200
right they're going to be able to

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,559
breathe life back into those old

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,760
buildings

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,880
so the more you think about communities

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
and the importance of these

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
interconnectivity you can think of the

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
same thing

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,720
in open source and we need diversity in

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,720
the same way

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,919
we need different social backgrounds

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,679
because those different social

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,200
backgrounds that come into our community

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,880
will help us build a better

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,240
product they will come with different

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,960
use cases

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,720
right that that initial primary

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,760
diversity that comes in that social

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
backgrounds

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,880
will help us build that second use case

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,200
and diversity

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,280
around building a better product a more

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,679
diverse more usable product

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,919
and the more diverse we are in the in

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,600
the more use cases that we can handle

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,520
the more sustainable our community will

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,960
be and the more sustainable our cities

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,440
will be

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,000
so after that we start thinking about

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,280
blocks

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,640
streets highways and subways because

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,280
this is how we get around in our city

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,960
now le bossier's version vision for for

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,640
cars was that we would have these major

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,760
thoroughfares where most cars would be

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,400
pushed

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,400
towards towards them this leaves the

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,360
city with these very long blocks and in

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,559
some cases this idea of super blocks

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,760
now the problem with this is that it

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,200
leaves very little room for sporadic and

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,679
random use

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,840
for example if i need to go to 50th

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,000
street and i live on 88th street

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,120
i'm most likely going to be pushed down

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,960
6th avenue

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,919
where everybody's going it wouldn't make

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,480
sense for me to go down the other roads

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,320
now if i go into the the next slide and

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,360
i show you by simply cutting the block

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,280
size in half

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,120
we create four different paths that i

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,000
can possibly take down to get the sixth

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,679
avenue

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,600
allowing for more spontaneous

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,600
exploration

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,120
and so interestingly enough what we're

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,400
looking for here

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,280
is is not about a single path from start

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
to finish

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,000
but as many paths as possible because

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,120
having as many paths as possible will

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,679
allow us to see

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,280
and experience different blocks and we

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,440
can keep these other blocks safe

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,600
merely by passing through them and

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
through that exploration

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,880
and so just like our cities we have to

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,000
think about that destination

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,280
in a not one-size-fits-all model people

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
coming from vms or

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,919
bare metal are going to have a very

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,280
different experience than if you came

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,720
from containers

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,200
and not only is this good but it's

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,720
desirable it goes back to diversity

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
a bunch of different entry points and

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,080
pathways we have to our proverbial city

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,840
we call spinnaker

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,919
you know i spent some time with raz and

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,400
nikima and we built a map of how users

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,200
go in and out of spinnaker so this slide

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,640
shows

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,919
all the different ways that we thought

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,640
of of how people go in and out

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,480
at first though four years ago that none

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,679
of this existed there was barely a

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,919
website

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,880
with documentation many of these paths

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,400
did not exist

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,080
but i'm really proud that we as a

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,280
community have built them and have

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,760
invested in them

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,640
over the last four years because that is

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,760
what makes our

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,799
community sustainable so

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,120
like spinnaker cities are platforms a

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,880
platform to create and share new ideas

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,799
with other people in your community

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,440
and to do so safely while pursuing

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,240
happiness you know without the stronger

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,919
communities american cities die and so

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,600
do open source communities

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,600
but when we learn from our past and our

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,200
neighboring domains like city planning

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,520
we can create communities that are

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,120
self-sustaining and can thrive

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,039
you know when we started armory four

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
years ago we saw a continuous delivery

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,840
tool

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,360
that was years ahead of everybody else

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,159
and we wanted to build on top of that

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,000
platform

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,919
what we were unaware of at the time was

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,720
how impactful these communities were

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,200
going to be

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,120
to this project and there was a there's

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,039
a saying by brett cannon from the python

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,279
community and he goes like this

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,400
i came for the language but stayed for

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,760
the community

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,159
and i could truly say the same for

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,200
spinnaker i came for the best software

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,840
delivery tool

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,840
but stayed for the community thank you
