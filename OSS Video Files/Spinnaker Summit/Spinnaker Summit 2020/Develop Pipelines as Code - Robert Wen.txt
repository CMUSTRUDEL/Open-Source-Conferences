Title: Develop Pipelines as Code - Robert Wen
Publication date: 2021-01-13
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	Creating pipelines can be done via the Spinnaker UI or templates. Additionally, Armoryâ€™s Pipelines as Code feature provides a way to specify pipeline definitions in source code repos such as GitHub. This talk highlights why we use pipelines as code through practical use cases covering reusability, security and change control. Many micro-services are deploying across multiple AWS environments, from dev, staging, RC to production. Use of shareable pipeline modules allows easier re-use for common stages such as bake, deploy manifest, docker registry triggers, find artifacts from pipelines and run cron jobs. With pipelines in github as code, we can keep track change history for audit purpose. This is very critical to meet security requirements. Enforce pipeline change policies and permissions based on LDAP groups.
