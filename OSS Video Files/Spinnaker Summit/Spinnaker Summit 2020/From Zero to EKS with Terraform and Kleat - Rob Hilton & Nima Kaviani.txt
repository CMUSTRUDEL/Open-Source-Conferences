Title: From Zero to EKS with Terraform and Kleat - Rob Hilton & Nima Kaviani
Publication date: 2021-01-17
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2020
Description: 
	Traditionally, bootstrapping Amazon EKS and Spinnaker has a reputation for being complex and challenging. In a world where "cloud native" means that processes should be declarative and easily repeatable, that sort of reputation tends to go against the grain. However, today's modern open-source tooling has matured dramatically over the last few years, and alongside that tooling we ask a simple question: "Who says it has to be difficult?" In this talk, we'll explore what it takes to build a fully-automated declarative pipeline for bootstrapping Amazon EKS and Spinnaker that uses only open-source tools. From Spinnaker's new Kubernetes-native deployment tool, Kleat, to Terraform and Weaveworks Flux, we'll break down each individual tool, where it best fits, and how they interoperate. We'll also explore "the power of opinionation," and showcase how customizing these pipelines to your organization can maximize the efficiency you get from AWS while minimizing your operational burden. The end result will be a single-command pipeline that takes a (mostly) empty AWS account and turns it into a production-ready playground with Kubernetes and Spinnaker at the ready!
