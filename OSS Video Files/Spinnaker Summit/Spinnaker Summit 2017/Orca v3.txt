	ROB FLETCHER, NETFLIX

We recently did a major rewrite of the foundations of Orca in order to improve the serviceâ€™s operational capabilities. This talk will discuss the limitations of the old Orca, the changes we made, how we operationalize the new implementation, and the opportunities we now have to take things further.
