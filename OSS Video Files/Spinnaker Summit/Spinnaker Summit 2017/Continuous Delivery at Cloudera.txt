Title: Continuous Delivery at Cloudera
Publication date: 2017-09-22
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2017
Description: 
	CHUKA OKOYE, CLOUDERA

At Cloudera we have a preference for immutable infrastructure components and also believe in everything as code mantra. This talk will provide more context on the where, how, why we've used some foundational components (Spinnaker, Jenkins, Terraform, Cloudformation and Lambda) to drive Continuous Delivery. We'll also discuss how we've extended Spinnaker to manage non-instance related resources in a secure manner.

all right Jenkins and

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,409
[Music]

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,469
[Music]

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,690
[Music]

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,779
[Music]

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,650
so say this a q-switched that implies

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,039
this service and this particular region

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,039
so

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,880
[Music]

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,370
so

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,799
[Music]

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,650
so

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,990
[Music]

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,759
[Music]

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,340
[Music]

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,340
[Music]

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,529
[Music]

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,820
[Music]

00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,279
so we have this process

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,850
[Music]

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,050
[Music]

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,050
fool

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:55,289
[Music]

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,599
[Music]

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:31,860
in place we start do services and you

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:34,910
can test immediately that's each time

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,910
[Music]

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,400
[Music]

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,829
[Music]

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:47,680
so I think it's easy to just change Oh

00:23:54,929 --> 00:26:02,369
all right another processor by the way

00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,369
stuff like

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,769
[Music]

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,700
into everything

00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,640
[Music]

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:10,479
[Music]

00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:57,190
so we

00:30:50,380 --> 00:32:14,060
so your industry so that part they get

00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:17,930
to apply that proud SS apply before the

00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:20,900
change actually hits production that

00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:24,830
will be great except your severe dead

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,750
dog alarms in terraform which there's a

00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:30,380
different cadence of being adjusted a

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:37,450
set of people and all of that different

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:37,450
from you obese yes right so there's boom

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:22,429
I am rules so I'm sorry on the reference

00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:39,290
to the US West - and that's wondering if

00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:40,940
you do multi Regent appointments so much

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,000
on diplomas but that approach we are

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,190
gives a bit of multi clouds so that's

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,790
that's different entirely different

00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,940
beasts

00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:50,970
but what

00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,970
Oh

00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,719
[Music]

00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,340
[Music]

00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,699
[Music]

00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,700
but with sorry very quickly when was day

00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,920
one when was your first thing that you

00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:17,510
started

00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:19,250
January 16th last week I know you said

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,440
that the other parts of clutter with the

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:25,010
highly stateful things are not your part

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,630
Cloudera but we use cloud are on the

00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:31,000
team that doesn't get defender from

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:33,440
scope from spinnaker it are people with

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,740
potentially somewhat ephemeral but very

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:42,410
different but very welder running

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:48,109
stateful systems as as you look at how

00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:51,200
to push forward with spinnaker are you

00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:54,170
looking at beyond things like an

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:59,390
application layer by layer absolutely

00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:01,550
the reason while stuff like the big

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,680
image is soon there's a natural fit

00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:06,500
friend with its pinnacle itself is when

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,390
it cannot use it the reason why didn't

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,930
you since they were for the most parts

00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:26,210
because we've not yet deployed Travis

00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:29,450
Colonel Travis Travis is for that wide

00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:32,180
group of folks current services that's a

00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:35,240
problem so until that lands and maybe

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,849
we'll build more teams gradually so

00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,940
definitely and even if I confront

00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:42,740
eccentric this vinegar itself would have

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,349
focused it's yourself but certainly

00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,880
possible I don't see why not

00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:49,430
it might not suit your needs we don't

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,830
have a two cylinder spherical internally

00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:57,140
called rocket those are the stuff for

00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:59,480
them I'm just it's very focused for the

00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:02,170
most part so I guess material more cloud

00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,170
itself

00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:09,849
[Music]

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,849
going once going twice

00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,920
