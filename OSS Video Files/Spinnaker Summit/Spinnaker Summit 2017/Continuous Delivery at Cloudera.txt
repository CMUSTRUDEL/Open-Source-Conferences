	CHUKA OKOYE, CLOUDERA

At Cloudera we have a preference for immutable infrastructure components and also believe in everything as code mantra. This talk will provide more context on the where, how, why we've used some foundational components (Spinnaker, Jenkins, Terraform, Cloudformation and Lambda) to drive Continuous Delivery. We'll also discuss how we've extended Spinnaker to manage non-instance related resources in a secure manner.
