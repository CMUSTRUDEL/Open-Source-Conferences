Netflix and Google teams have been working together to build Spinnaker's new general purpose canary capability. We will shortly be releasing a new Spinnaker microservice, Kayenta, that will be capable of integrating with a host of metric stores (e.g. Atlas, Stackdriver, Prometheus, OpsMx) and allow for pluggable canary judges. Netflix's internal Automated Canary Analysis (ACA) service served as the inspiration for this new service, and the ACA canary judge is configured by default. In this talk we will cover the overall architecture of Kayenta, and explore some use cases end-to-end.
