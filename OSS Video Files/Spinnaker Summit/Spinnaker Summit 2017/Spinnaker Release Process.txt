	JAKE KIEFER, STEVEN KIM, GOOGLE

Spinnaker microservices used to be released on their own cadences without cross-service compatibility validation for any set of service versions. Jake led the design and implementation of the new release process used to drive the Spinnaker OSS versioned releases, which are distinct sets of service versions validated through integration tests (citest), and installed via Halyard. Steven will  talk about motivations for the release process, and Jake will go into the technical details of the release process design and how it solved problems existing previously.
