In this talk we'll discuss how the brand new pipeline templates were put to use in production at Waze. We'll discuss the benefits of pipeline templates and patterns we found useful, both in code reuse for pipelines, and using pipeline templates to implement multi-cloud/provider infrastructure as code.
