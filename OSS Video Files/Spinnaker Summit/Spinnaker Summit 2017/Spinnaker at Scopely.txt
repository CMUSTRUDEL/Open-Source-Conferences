	AVRAM LYON, SCOPELY

Scopely is using Spinnaker to help diverse game studios implement clean and reliable deployment patterns. In the past 9 months, we’ve moved three game backends and dozens of our platform services to deploy with Spinnaker in production. The move has helped us simplify the stage-QA-canary-scale-switch deployments of game teams and radically reduce human error and complexity. We will share how we built pipelines to canonicalize our standard practices for teams, as well as the deploy strategies for multi-tier game servers and for streaming data applications, and the pitfalls and benefits we’ve encountered.
