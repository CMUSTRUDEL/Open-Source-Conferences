00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,070
will stop so hey thank you very much for

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:20,600
for attending the first-ever spinnaker

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:24,300
summit and welcome to Netflix this is

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,820
related to have you all here I do want

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,400
to say so yeah there are over 200 people

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,219
here today representing over 50

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,460
companies so thank you all again for

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:38,000
coming last night thank you to armory

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,829
for having a happy hour and dinner at

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,210
the Jack Rose House of libation I've

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,070
never been there it was a good time so

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,420
thank you very much the Armory folks

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,980
putting that on it was fun to meet some

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,190
people that I have known virtually now

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:57,090
for I guess a year or two that was cool

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,260
I do want to also pay a special thank

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,059
you to Amy and Natasha

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,369
all right so Amy and Natasha work at

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,710
Netflix they work with facilities and

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,860
event planning and with engineering to

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,900
make all of this happen without their

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,799
help I think this would have just

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:21,540
crushed under its own weight so a big

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,450
thanks to Amy and the time and all of

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,250
Netflix facilities and then last but not

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,170
least I do want to say thank you to all

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,520
presenters I recognize that I didn't put

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,350
out an email to all the presenters so a

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,270
couple came out to me today and said hey

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,100
am I allowed to use my computer the

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,210
answer is yes so and in the room where

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,220

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,850
Netflix or there that will help you out

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,200
but there's no need to send me your

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,140
presentation or anything like that

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,590
and we are videoing or recording all

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:58,200
presentations so you'll be able to watch

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,549

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,670

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,619
this is track 3 as you've noted

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,170
hopefully in the the agenda the next

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,830
talk that would would be in the theater

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,540
is actually

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,870

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:23,520
with Dominator Richard are you here okay

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,990
Akira is I think in the back of d there

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,850
will be Netflix errs that will guide you

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,770
to that room that is the only track

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,760
three presentation that is not in the

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:35,400
theater Ferris Bueller and birdcage

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,490
there across this courtyard in building

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,740
II the you can get into those rooms very

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,720
easily they have essentially doors that

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,520
are outside yeah you can you can get in

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,750
to those rooms without having to use a

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,520
badge or anything like that the window

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,840
doors are open so birdcage and Ferris

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,250
Bueller right across the courtyard and

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,610
are there science for the restrooms did

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,410
anyone notice there are yeah all right

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,570
so some folks have found oh yeah well

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,730
there's a sign so there are two sets of

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,070
restrooms in building D this is building

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,350
D and there are obviously restrooms also

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,690
in building e if you can't find them

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,190
just find anyone wearing like a

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,690
spinnaker and Netflix shirt and they'll

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,550
be happy to direct you to the restrooms

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,140
but there suffice to say they are in

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,459
both buildings and you are free to use

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,800
them at whenever you need to

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:26,300
we breakfast as you all saw was outside

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,640
we're also going to have lunch there and

00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,950
that's also where a happy hour and

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,959
dinner will take place tonight as well

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,540
as tomorrow's happy hour we'll all be

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,459
outside in this courtyard area so this

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,160
this will be our area for the next 48

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,850
hours I hope you like it it's gonna be a

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,920
little warm today

00:03:41,850 --> 00:04:00,060
I understand last night we had a lot of

00:03:43,920 --> 00:04:09,330
wind and it broke some of the umbrellas

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:11,430
broke so I apologize okay so hopefully

00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,769
most of you solve the agenda there's

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,140
some printed copies floating around and

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,060
there are easels up with the agenda this

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,120
is a live document I made some changes I

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,740
believe on Friday so go to that URL and

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,360
that is the latest and greatest version

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,400
of the agenda I don't think anything's

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,300
much has changed for today although I

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,669
will know

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,280
I did switch around two of the ACA talks

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,629
and I didn't know the the printed

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,759
version on the easels out there was

00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,280
incorrect so be sure to go to this URL

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,360
to see the latest and greatest agenda

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,659
and if you're on slack there is a

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,360
channel in the the spinnaker team it's

00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:49,860
called spinnaker summit and please join

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,210
it if you have questions comments

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,449
concerns go ahead and voice them in

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,699
there and as far as there's breakout

00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:59,430
sessions in the agenda for tomorrow

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,530
afternoon however we do have additional

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,440
rooms booked for the next 48 hours and

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,180
so if you're in a session and you decide

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,280
hey I want to learn more about this or I

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,949
really want to dig deep on kubernetes or

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,509
whatever it is you can you can voice

00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:14,099
your opinion in there will also have

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,530
easels up where you can kind of put note

00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:18,030
cards up but my point is is that we have

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,919
these breakout rooms and we can go into

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,050
any time during the day and discuss it

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,270
with with various people so feel free to

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,800
you know leverage the the hallway tract

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,139
so to speak if you want to hang out

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,729
outside and talk with people you're more

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,169
than welcome to do so if there's an

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,819
additional conversation you want to have

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,889
a sidebar but you don't know how to

00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,440
engage that a good place to start just

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,789
come to either Andy or myself and we can

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,830
good and point you to the right people

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,819
we get the group together and talk about

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,819
the specific topic you're interested

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,919
the folks at armory have created a hack

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,979
pad I think that's what you called it

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,620
so this is like an open document anyone

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,600
can go in there and add notes and they

00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,919
said that they will categorize all the

00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,539
notes put them together and share them

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,539
afterwards so this is open to anybody in

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:07,690
the conference to just put deep thoughts

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:10,120
or whatever it is I that you would find

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,430
helpful to other people and they'll do a

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,669
good job of getting the word out Daniel

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,850
should I say anything else

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,850
good enough

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,790
some of you may have seen that there's a

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:27,450
spinnaker survey so if you haven't taken

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,880
the survey please do there's the link it

00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:33,419
should only take a few moments that

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,450
survey has been amazingly insightful to

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,300
us and in fact some of the content that

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,160
we will you know be having this this

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,550
next two days we're very much informed

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,600
by what was in that the results of that

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,240
survey it's clear that many of you are

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,130
using kubernetes and want to extract as

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,380
much value out of the integration with

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,450
spinnaker as possible and so that's why

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,180
we have entire kubernetes talk we have a

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,410
kubernetes panel and Stephen is more

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,080
than happy to take all your feature

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,660
requests he also likes bug request for

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,990
any Google product he's a good person to

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,790
send about but there are other things in

00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,010
that survey that we're super interesting

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,240
in terms of declarative delivery so

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,000
there's a talk on managed pipeline

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,520
templates there was some comments in the

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,169
survey about how to extend spinnaker so

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,590
we've got a whole session on extending

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,570
spinnaker we also have panel discussion

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,979
on extending spinnaker so I really I

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,450
speak for everyone in the community when

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,650
I say thank you for those that have

00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,850
already filled out the survey and if you

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,850
haven't done it yet please do so

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,680
I didn't really have many thoughts that

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,200
I wanted to share except just one that

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,540
Andy and I and a couple of us had talked

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:51,760
about are you I'm Steven Kim I'm the had

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,760
a drag google vinegar vinegar team we're

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,220
all here for the first time here I'm

00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,000
California were based out of New York

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,380
City and Annie and I and a couple of us

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,500
have talked about what a spinner

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,530
community together look like for a long

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,910
time actually and we had a number of

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,670
opportunities to try to bring something

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,610
like this together that's a year ago two

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,650
years ago and then we had always sort of

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,390
held it off deliberately like when it

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,010
was the right time they wouldn't make

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,240
itself obvious and I think we're

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,640
definitely at that point you know for me

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,050
personally the one Oh launch that the

00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,480
community came together and pushed back

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,480
in June was pretty significant and up

00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,729
until then um all of us were so heads

00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,470
down developmental features will be out

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,450
there and I feel like we're certainly

00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:39,729
not done well we're at a really good

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,250
place and we're at the starting line is

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,599
where we are what I hope will happen and

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,610
that's why I felt was the right time to

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,140
bring something like this together is we

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,340
hope that this is a point of inflection

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,960
or the community to move from relatively

00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,130
a smaller number of core contributors

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,860
developing mainline as well as you know

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,260
some niche features out there to really

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,750
exploding out to a larger number of

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,390
people doing development for whatever is

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,160
I don't know if at the moment spinnaker

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,750
the right thing for spinnaker is to go

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,240
and take let's say like a Jenkins model

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,340
where helps an ecosystem plug-in

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,300
ecosystem of 10,000 or whatever I don't

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:21,010
know if that's the right direction for

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:22,960
us but clearly there are gonna be you

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,200
guys are gonna need and we would love to

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,370
go to see an increasing number of

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,410
contributors to the community as well as

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,750
and that's the way we're gonna go so

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,860
welcome we're so glad that you guys all

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,510
made the time to come out here that this

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,700
is important enough for you I was

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,930
talking to Matt our rtl and I was think

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,960
it's a little weird in a room full of

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,880
spinnaker people a little in Britt and

00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,410
Brad just because I'm so used to

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,210
everywhere I go I think all of you guys

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,010
understand that spinnaker is a little

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,540
different in its approach

00:09:51,010 --> 00:10:00,790
and it's typical questions that we get

00:09:52,540 --> 00:10:02,410
are like houses didn't Jenkins and I'm

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,790
so used to given that spiel and having

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,680
that conversation every time in a crowd

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,720
a room now that I'm a room rule some

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:13,829
people call her or any of the same look

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:16,930
like mine I don't a quick conference

00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:19,029
we're done here I do want to call out

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,690
that there are people that came as far

00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:25,720
away as Europe to be here so again I'm

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,220
just elated that everyone is here and

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,300
there's also people from the East Coast

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,980
I know that was far as well so I just

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:37,120
want to spend a few minutes on something

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,019
that I had a conversation last night and

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,350
it's not the first time I've had this

00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:45,990
conversation where someone will describe

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:49,360
spinnaker as a deployment platform and

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,649
in many cases I think you're right when

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,690
you do describe it as a deployment

00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:55,390
platform since we came out with

00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:59,560
spinnaker you know two years ago at this

00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:02,740
point close to two years it's been a

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,800
long time we've added you know obviously

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,860
myriad cloud providers obviously Netflix

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,019
with first-class support for AWS and we

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,240
also added support for Titus which is

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,019
our own container cloud the good folks

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,180
at Google out at kubernetes App Engine

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,860
GCP and then folks at Target and Veritas

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,779
added OpenStack and then we got the

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,100
folks at Cerner that added DCOs and we

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,279
have the good folks from Oracle here

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,279
that

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:34,630
am I missing anyone but even though it's

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,980
very easy to see spinnaker as a

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,590
deployment platform I think that's

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,690
actually quite limiting in terms of what

00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,850
spinnaker is and I think if you look at

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,870
the long-term vision of where we're

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,730
going with spinnaker

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,460
I think it's much more of a delivery

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,110
platform and I think when you think of

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,210
it as a delivery platform it opens up a

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,830
whole new world of possibilities in ways

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,390
in which you can innovate on the

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,620
platform and I'll give you some examples

00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:01,420
and this was a learning opportunity for

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:03,730
me Netflix so there's a couple talks

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,590
today about ACA and in fact the talk

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,500
this afternoon is about how we use ACA

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,440
here at Netflix and so ACA is automated

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,300
canary analysis it's a phenomenal

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,340
service and a means as kind of like the

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,710
last quality gate before you flip a

00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:22,480
service you know live to the entire

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:24,640
globe and ACA was not a stage that we

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,070
came out of the box at Netflix

00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,710
originally so we came out with a series

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,960
of stages and we had application teams

00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,850
come onboard the spinnaker and a number

00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,950
of them kept asking us for like when are

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,650
you gonna have native ACA support as a

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,990
stage and we finally you know we would

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,660
correctly prioritize it and we added ACA

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,700
and once we added ACA as a stage it's a

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,230
part of your delivery process it was

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,630
kind of like the dominoes fell and a

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,120
number of you know high-speed teams just

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,770
jumped on the spinnaker but there was

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,660
one other team that actually began to

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,550
use spinnaker that I had no idea was

00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,780
even on the you know the horizon of even

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,670
I didn't even know they knew spinnaker

00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:06,520
existed so it turns out that a large

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:09,070
portion of the Netflix product is

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,200
downloaded from a CDN so if you fire up

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,490
Netflix on your browser or your Xbox or

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,130
something like that a portion of that

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:18,610
app is downloaded from a CDN and those

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,380
teams now leverage spinnaker and they

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,260
don't even have first-class support for

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,730
copying a file to see DNS but the reason

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,780
why they jumped on the spinnaker is

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:32,530
because we had native ACA support and so

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,030
just that's delivery at one example of

00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,650
them seeing hey here's the power of

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,360
delivery I don't really care about the

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,420
deployment part that's just a file copy

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,820
to a CDN but the ability to say hey I

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,970
want to have ten percent of traffic hit

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,910
you know Firefox latest version of you

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,620
know the Netflix product and then roll

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,350
it out to a hundred percent after some

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,820
portion of time and the ACA service

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,260
telling everything's okay that's a

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,250
really powerful construct so that was

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:03,190
that was one eye open experience for me

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,110
shortly after we introduced ACA that the

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,240
good folks in the and the platform team

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,520
here at Netflix came to came to us and

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,090
said hey why don't you add the ability

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,830
to create pipelines to effect fast

00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,090
properties so fast properties are you

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,770
know a service here and Netflix think of

00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,450
it as runtime properties you know you

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,710
can send some value let's say to true

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,210
and your app doesn't have to get

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,620
restarted or redeployed the app just

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,340
picks up the value and changes things

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,410
you can imagine this is a very very very

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,880
very interesting very very important

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,470
service here at Netflix and I imagine

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,850
every large enterprise has a similar

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,910
service this is how we flipped content

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,740
live you know and I suspect something

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,600
will go live this week some awesome show

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,710
and someone will change a fast property

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,150
in the whole world will get you know

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:47,770
whatever season five of house of cards

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:49,600
are and when they first proposed using

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,020
pipelines to affect these fast

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,100
properties me and other people on the

00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,570
team we're like well that's kind of

00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,980
crazy there's no deployment part about

00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,900
that way I don't understand why we do

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,090
this after some discussions it made

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,210
total sense that again this is delivery

00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,170
the orchestration of taking a property

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,300
instead of rolling it out to the entire

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,160
globe at once you could you could roll

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,500
it out with a small scope and slowly

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,440
increase the scope using pipelines and

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,330
so now fast property pipelines our first

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,310
class citizen in spinnaker here in

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,720
Netflix and again that was just that was

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,160
an eye-opening experience for me because

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,620
you don't deploy these fast properties

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,770
you just kind of effect them then they

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:30,940
magically appear that's again delivery

00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:32,620
and finally in discussing with various

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,200
teams about how they leverage Neff or

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,180
how they leverage spinnaker I ended up

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,490
talking with a team that uses spinnaker

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,170
to essentially validate library

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,660
dependencies either their own or other

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,880
people's

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,890
oddities and so they have they have

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,690
pipelines to essentially do deployments

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,250
to say hey does our library break any of

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,020
our you know downstream dependencies or

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,960
upstream and then do any of our

00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,070
dependencies break us and that was an

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,750
eye-opening experience for me because I

00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:00,560
had no idea people would use vinegar for

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,840
that and so a CA and the corresponding

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,260
application of you know device teams

00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,900
using spinnaker fast properties and

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:11,840
library owners helped me realize that

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:14,090
spinnaker is a delivery platform and in

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,430
fact once you start thinking of it that

00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,380
way you realize that there's a ton of

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,970
innovation to be had there so we can

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,710
keep adding cloud providers those are

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,180
very important don't get me wrong but I

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,740
think where the real innovation comes is

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,020
when you think about the stages that

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,550
lead up to a deployment and so in

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:33,110
Netflix we have three stages that you

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,670
know aren't open source at this point

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,820
although we'll talk more about ACA

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,100
because that's that's coming but we also

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,310
have a stage called bio way which allows

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,990
us to do some very specific testing

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,620
within production or actually any

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,270
environment and then we have another

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,310
stage called chap which is our chaos

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,280
application platform and these are

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,780
custom stages that we've built in the

00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,840
spinnaker ecosystems that are Netflix

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,430
only unless you know these corresponding

00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,890
services open selves open source

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,810
themselves but it's easy to do and you

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,520
can do it at your company and one thing

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,110
the whole point of this conference is us

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,280
to get together and understand how we're

00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,080
using spinnaker and learn from each

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,610
other because when we innovate when

00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,890
Google innovates when you innovate we

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,780
all win regardless if it's open sourced

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,880
or not invariably if you're gonna create

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,740
a custom stage you're gonna ask

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,000
questions you're gonna maybe write some

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,770
documentation you might create some

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,090
issues but whatever you do it's a win

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,470
for everybody else and that you're gonna

00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,690
make it easier for the next person to

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,730
add a custom stage or a new cloud

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,240
provider or layer something on top of

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,030
spinnaker

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,160
so I really do think it's a win-win when

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,540
you innovate we all win when we innovate

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:52,000
we all win everyone wins when we

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:54,549
innovate all right great point so

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,980
if you look at the agenda we do have

00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:00,490
breakout we have breakout sessions kind

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,929
of in the actual agenda for Tuesday I

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,720
think I did talk a little about this but

00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:06,190
we do have two rooms available and I

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,539
will I will make it known what those

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,740
rooms are I figured it would be kind of

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:10,690
hard to do them right now because no

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,690
one's I will we're all getting to know

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,580
each other but at any point if you want

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,190
to have a discussion about like some of

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,590
the stuff I just showed you there either

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,059
put it in the slack channel or there'll

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,289
be easels up you can put a little note

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,669
card and say hey I want to learn more

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:26,230
about chap or I want to understand how

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,350
Netflix does Byway or something like

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,539
that and we can we can go to one of

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,830
these rooms and we can talk it through

00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,270
the Netflix folks are happy to demo

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,220
anything we're doing here and I hope

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,570
same with anyone else here if you can

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,760
demo what you're doing with with

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,280
spinnaker that'd be great it's not

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,370
enough information anyone have any

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,370
