Spinnaker is a difficult system to run and operate; it takes many organizations weeks to get a PoC running, and whole teams to keep Spinnaker operational. We wanted to reduce this operational complexity both in onboarding and maintenance, and came up with “Halyard” to do so. Lars led the Halyard implementation, and will go into the weeds of what it does and how it works.
