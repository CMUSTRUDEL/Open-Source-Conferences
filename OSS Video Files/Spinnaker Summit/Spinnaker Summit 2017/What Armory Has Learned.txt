Title: What Armory Has Learned
Publication date: 2017-09-25
Playlist: Spinnaker Summit 2017
Description: 
	DANIEL ODIO, ARMORY

Armory has engaged with over 300 engineering leaders on their CI/CD pain points and installed Spinnaker across multiple enterprise customers. In that process Armory has learned how to operationalize Spinnaker in vastly differing environments, what the biggest blockers are to adoption, and what features are most valuable to (and most requested by) enterprise customers.  They'll share their learnings, along with tactical pro-tips to help global companies succeed with Spinnaker.

alright let's go ahead and get started

00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:09,059
thank you for coming to listen to our

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,820
playbook this is a playbook that we've

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,580
developed in working with enterprise

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,049
companies on how to effectively adopt

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,810
spinnaker within the uprights

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,369
so I guess let me just start with a show

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,260
of hands I understand the room because

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,240
we're really here for you so how many of

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,430
you are already running spinnaker inside

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,070
their companies just raise your hand how

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,619
many of you are evaluating spinnaker or

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,390
thinking about it ok yeah so this talk

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,710
is really going to be for you and those

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,780
of you that are aren't you running it in

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,070
production please feel free to share

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,559
your tips - let's make this

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,030
collaborative and fun we're here for 45

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,660
minutes together so you might as well

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,600
enjoy it so I'm gonna start with some

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,719
quick intros and then I'll do a very

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,579
quick overview of our marine and why I

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,649
work here let's see if I can get this to

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,120
work

00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,670
so I'm already on the sea of our marine

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,780
my co-founders Isaac and then they're

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,059
gonna be the ones doing most of the

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,080
talking today we're a seed funded

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,780
startup up in Silicon Valley and we're

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,549
helping companies for July spinnaker so

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,140
why we're here I'll start with white

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,150
armories here we all work together in

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,520
our last company we arrived in that

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,600
company in 2013 that company had a very

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,909
hard time deploying software about four

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,850
releases per month everyone took 30 to

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,049
40 days very unhappy engineers is

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,000
anything worse than checking in code and

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,890
having it sit somewhere for a long time

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,350
so over the course of a three year

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,479
period we completely revamped the

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,340
infrastructure actually the actually

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,439
Andrew who's here who's on the army team

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,780
that built our own in-house CI CD

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,500
platform and we went from deploying four

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,780
tons a month

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,119
this chart shows 300 tons of we actually

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,710
got it up to 2,000 times a month we left

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,299
and do I think the really interesting

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,460
thing about this chart is you can see

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,070
back when we weren't deploying very much

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,079
we also weren't deploying very broadly

00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,610
there were large parts of the code base

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,710
that we were afraid to touch the people

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,780
who built those products had left the

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,159
company and nobody knew how they were

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,509
deployed and so they were afraid to

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,239
actually innovate on them and you can

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,550
see each of these is a service and then

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,530
over time we started really to pull

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,820
a lot more broadly so we started

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,230
touching a lot more than two in Bates

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,000
and that was very transformative for the

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,830
company it actually let us build an

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,780
entirely new high margin line of

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,460
business and that's when we got really

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,690
excited about the business impact that's

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,510
been occurring not just the technical

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,730
value but it literally transformed the

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,750
company and the company's value and that

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,760
and that was a big deal that's that's

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,990
why we started armory and when we

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,790
learned about spinnaker and there was

00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,710
being open source instead of building it

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,990
ourselves we thought let's participate

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,370
in this community and extend it for the

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:47,580
enterprise also the cost of messing up

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,560
with software is really going up just a

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,360
couple of quick examples so you know a

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,970
bad release to an American Airlines

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
pilot app they used to use log books now

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,190
that use and iPad app but bad release

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,740
cause planes to sit on runways and kids

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,310
to be sleeping and airport lounges and

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,940
all of that

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:10,440
not so fun stuff another example the NYC

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,140
had an outage caused by a software

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,640
update so the cost of not being able to

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,270
deploy software is going up

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,440
I think the even bigger deal though is

00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,840
companies that know how to win with

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,700
software are starting to take over in

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,580
other industries and out-compete

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,660
companies that don't so Amazon acquired

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,100
Whole Foods because they can get more

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,440
value out of Whole Foods and Moltres

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,209
itself could you do the software Amazon

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,370
doesn't have to make money on groceries

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,110
and so now Kroger and all these other

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,090
companies are having to figure out how

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,340
to be software company you know Kroger

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,350
ads online ordering options and invest

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,810
in technology to withstand Amazon's

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,910
advanced things like that so you know

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,860
boardrooms are starting to get a lot

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,420
more activists the investors are

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,770
starting to say you need to extract more

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,600
enterprise value from your company

00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,520
through software so we think this is

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,530
just the beginning of a multi decade

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,120
trend where every company is going to

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,739
have to learn to be a software company

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,780
or they're gonna die like you know I

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,820
think all of us in this room agree

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,420
that's true or if that's that's why all

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,910
of us are here is that an actual like

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,310
way back and was on site yeah yeah so

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,200
the reason I put this slide up was like

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:22,440
back in 1994 it's like yeah that's a

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:24,720
really cute company website back in 94

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,660
you know a lot different than something

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,130
that they are today the average low

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,950
performing enterprise deployed software

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,710
seven times per year these high

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,450
performing companies deploy thousands of

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,210
times per year Netflix deploys 4,000

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,700
times a day or more now so the Delta the

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,440
gap between low performing companies and

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,440
high Pro companies is really huge

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,870
another great example is for a thousand

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,400
years the hotel industry was never

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,990
disrupted people always needed a place

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,030
to stay and not your being be is the

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,740
largest hotel operating in the world

00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,090
they don't have a single room so I don't

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,830
know tell us competing against Airbnb

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,600
they can't just spit up more hotel rooms

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,930
you have to figure out how to get good

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,090
at software so what we've learned and

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,830
talking to a number of executives at

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,630
large companies we've talked to probably

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:16,920
300 SVP and CEOs engineering managers at

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:19,590
this point is there's a couple of stages

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,230
to get to this Nirvana and so we made

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,480
this diagram to help these executives

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,770
kind of argue amongst themselves about

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,050
what stage they're in it's pretty

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,880
hilarious to pop this slide up when

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,950
we're talking these companies and we

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,830
watch them argue with each other about

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,930
where they are the reality is every team

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,290
and a company is probably at different

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,270
places so what we've learned is that you

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,010
can't jump stages so you can't go from

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,020
stage one to stage five if you're still

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,400
on the in the data center and you know

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,440
you're doing mutable deployments you're

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,720
SS aging in the prod you can't just jump

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,550
to intelligent deployments and be where

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,960
Netflix is and you know there's only a

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,450
handful of companies that are even in

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,020
stage 5 but this is a really good

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,010
diagram to help talk about the

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,570
progression that companies need to make

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,320
and then denies people talk more about

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,480
that but we shared with everybody and

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,490
their little Netflix took bags a book by

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,169
a riley called cloud native evolution

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,640
great book to bring back into your

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,350
companies if you're frustrated there are

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,910
people that don't quite get it share

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,130
that book with an executive it's an 80

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:25,350
page book that talks all about basically

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:27,360
moving through these stages we're trying

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,900
to figure out how to quantify this

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,479
concept of confident deployment velocity

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,460
we're playing around with a formula that

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,240
because you can only improve what you

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,060
can measure

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,860
right so I don't know that this is the

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,960
exact right formula I actually love to

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,860
get people that Google done if this

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,259
would help you have a conversation

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,139
inside of your companies but the kind of

00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,819
broad idea here is that velocity is

00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,440
actually safer even though it's

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,750
counterintuitive shipping small this

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,099
often is safer than bulking all your

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,009
features up and having fewer deployments

00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:04,319
and so you know if we could have some

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:08,099
way to quantify deployments per app per

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,919
month in the numerator with some kind of

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:14,520
an SLA that increases you know as

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,199
deployments get safer this is this is an

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,319
idea would love to get people's feedback

00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,479
on that because we'd like to start

00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,060
scoring safety and speed within

00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,639
companies so if anyone has any feedback

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,440
on that let it snow

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,479
okay so I'm gonna have eyes that come up

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,190
and go a little bit deeper on the

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,650
playbook and then Ben's gonna talk about

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:40,219
how we actually execute this playbook

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:42,719
with improvements all right guys so

00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:44,039
which one you guys actually had

00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:48,240
spinnaker production we're actually

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:51,120
using this vinegar and besides a Netflix

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,280
team's out of that how much adoption

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,289
have you gotten with the

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,669
the applications keen nerve is a lot of

00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:59,219
application as you team using it or a

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:02,400
little so like 10 20 percent whose great

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:06,210
hand by 25 percent more than 25 percent

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,630
of your apps are on spinnaker massive 10

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,620
25 % anybody bless them that's a 25

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,169
percent sorry

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,020
formless bodiless yeah so typically what

00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:24,449
we see is more on that side there's a

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:27,569
few that are more but the reason why I

00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,680
think we see this is because there's two

00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,819
different pictures that are being

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,180
painted with inside of your organization

00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,709
and the people in this room are

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,029
generally the people that kind of see

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,849
houses on fire

00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,039
things don't work well things are broken

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,839
things need to be fixed and they're

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,459
dealing with the issues all the time but

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,589
what your application engineer see is a

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,420
completely different picture they see

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:48,930
rainbows and lollipops because they

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,090
don't have to

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,640
with the same issues that you do they

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,260
just have to deploys they tell you to

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,990
deploy something or they to play

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,640
something when things go wrong DevOps is

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,950
a team that gets called in first

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,540
so with spinnaker the first thing you

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,970
guys got agreed that there's a problem

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,920
within your organization at all trying

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,050
to improve the solution where the rest

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,990
of your organization doesn't see a

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:16,080
problem is really just an uphill battle

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:19,650
then we see that nine times out of ten

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,690
in enterprises this is typically where

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,670
spinnaker fails it's just like what are

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,950
you trying to fix in the first place and

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,240
because spinnaker is a great tool and

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,890
provides a lot of value and we're

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,110
engineered you want to play with rules I

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:34,320
mean we want to stand them up and solve

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,800
problems that's just not enough to get

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,630
that so that the actual organization

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,850
starts to adopt vinegar so really we're

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,310
going to show you how to have one or two

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,830
app teams fall in love with spinnaker

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,590
and let them be the evangelists for you

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,510
so that the other teams can see the

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,730
value of spinnaker without you trying to

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,380
just shove a solution in front of their

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,070
face and you're going to have to show

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,660
kind of a compare and contrast with the

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,940
existing solutions that are there today

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,680
or your existing deployment solutions

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,300
with spinnaker and in order to do that

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,130
you kinda have to start with baseline

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,050
metrics you have to show like what are

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,780
you either trying to improve for what's

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,580
the problem that you're trying to solve

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,080
and so when we engage with enterprises

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,180
the first thing we try to do we don't

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,010
stand up spinnaker we don't want to help

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,010
them configure apps we just try to

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,620
understand what is the status quo and we

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,570
do that through data and metrics which I

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,430
think most people do they just skip

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,200
ahead and go straight to let's stand up

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,860
spinnaker and do a POC and make sure can

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,300
deploy map but without this the later

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,680
steps will fail you'll get it up and

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,200
running and you won't get it really

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,550
adopted within the organization so what

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,290
are some of the things that are common

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,080
across all enterprises that we measure

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,330
are things like time to production so

00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,660
for instance the moment that code gets

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,840
committed to master and and all

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,270
development is done

00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,040
what is the time from that moment to the

00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,200
time that that application actually

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,000
shows the production and there could be

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,130
within every enterprise there's a bunch

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,010
of different steps there could be a

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,480
change review board that is typically in

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:14,660
the way and that may last time there may

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,540
be manual QA SVP has to sign off a bunch

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,150
of different steps who gets it to the

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,010
next thing that we measure which are

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,410
manual stuff just the number of manual

00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,480
steps an interesting thing about this

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,800
particular metric which is the one we

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,110
measure the most actually with

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,260
organizations to show the before and

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,900
after is that when we go talk to the

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:39,290
engineers and try to quantify this

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,510
number we'll sit down with them and

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,490
we'll say in fact actually we've gone to

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,290
an enterprise and we said hey how many

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,300
manual steps do you have they'll say we

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,040
have four all right cool let's sit down

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,020
and let's talk about it how many say you

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,820
know what happens in each step so we sit

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,680
down we talk about it and it turns out

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,140
actually they have seventeen steps

00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,600
manual steps and when they said four

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:03,620
what they meant was we had four general

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,970
broad steps and so these are things like

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:10,970
literally copying tar files up to s3 and

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,040
then now you have to go and do a commit

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,930
on to a chef rebound and then you have

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,700
to get that PR review they would

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,200
consider that one whole step but in

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,630
reality there's a lot of places for

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,310
things to break and fail there so a lot

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,750
of times I think when people don't

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,340
realize what the problem is it's just

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,800
because they've generalized the problem

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,260
so much they think deployments is just

00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,730
one step and then but in fact there's a

00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,410
lot of manual intervention that needs to

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,570
happen the other thing we measure are

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,550
things like steps for rollback I'd say

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,740
50 percent of the enterprise cases that

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,330
we run into this feat they actually

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,550
don't roll back they always roll forward

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,640
and if they do roll back it's a pretty

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:49,520
clumsy set of manual steps tax your roll

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,980
back so when failures happen you know

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,540
meantime the resolution is super high

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,840
because their ability to rollback is

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,400
close to impossible even when there's

00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,830
their last one is that deployments do

00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,570
tutorial tooling for just counting the

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,900
number about deployments that happen due

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,580
to the tooling breaking so you know and

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,170
going to all of these enterprises the

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,939
real competitor

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,859
there's no competitor really to

00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:15,170
spinnaker it's really just Jenkins plus

00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,720
Bosch Jenkins plus Python it's whatever

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:20,449
the engineer who built the last

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,399
deployment tooling who've no longer

00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,869
works at the company is there and that's

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,290
really what you're competing against

00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:29,509
that is the status quo and and we see

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,999
that breaking a lot but because nobody

00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:34,009
actually keeps track of that number it's

00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:36,769
hard to prove that hey there's this

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:39,049
office of the shelf solution that called

00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:41,449
spinnaker that will relinquish us from

00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:43,480
having to manage a whole bunch of shell

00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:46,819
scripts whole bunch of spaghetti code

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,739
that nobody can maintain so that's

00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:53,389
another really good metric to to start

00:13:48,739 --> 00:14:03,739
using as a baseline so once you've got

00:13:53,389 --> 00:14:07,339
your scratch Tomas and I touched in that

00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:10,279
a little bit I'll get back to that in a

00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:13,309
fly but typically the best way to answer

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,899
that is if it does break do you want 50

00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:16,790
of the world's best engineers working on

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,889
it or do you just want a team of two to

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,209
three people who work on it part time on

00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,519
your deployment tool and well that's

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:26,089
what we see is people not really fully

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,220
committed to the dev tooling or the to

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,649
do deployments but really I mean you got

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,269
Netflix and Google and a whole bunch of

00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:34,309
other engineers here or working on

00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:39,439
full-time in that how are you gonna beat

00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:41,839
that I'll dive into that a little bit in

00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:43,129
a second so before you start even

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,860
working with spinnaker the next thing to

00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,569
do is pick an application right so with

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,489
inside of any Enterprise there are

00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:51,649
literally thousands of applications to

00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:55,629
choose from which one do you choose

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:57,499
and we've seen mistakes here as well so

00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:00,559
you're going to want to pick an

00:14:57,499 --> 00:15:02,779
application that you have control of and

00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,480
the reason for this is because spinnaker

00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,799
is an opinionated framework and it's

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,359
going to impose those opinions on the

00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,339
way that you deployed and what that

00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:12,829
likely is going to mean is that you're

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,569
going to have some level of architecture

00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,939
changes some level of configuration

00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:18,919
changes potentially some security

00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:20,160
changes potentially some networking

00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,779
changes

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,000
things are gonna change while using

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,500
spinnaker and so we've gone into an

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,810
enterprise before if we pick an

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,360
application turns out that person

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,980
doesn't have access to change the code

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,569
base or change the networking and an

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,579
evaluation that should take a few days

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:38,009
is now taking a few weeks because they

00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,480
don't have resources and this is this

00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:41,639
happens a lot in enterprises just

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,110
because it's very very large different

00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,089
teams manage different types of

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,949
dependencies and resources and getting

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,269
access to those things is difficult so

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:52,170
make sure you pick an application that

00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:54,209
you can mostly control another thing

00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:58,410
that you're going to want to look for is

00:15:54,209 --> 00:16:00,420
an app that is mostly immutable and

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,910
mostly it's contained so the least

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,160
amount external resources or

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,750
dependencies as possible so don't pick

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,220
the app that has ten different sets of

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,500
databases and ten different queues

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,089
success the the app that may have a

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,250
database the moment you start

00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:16,199
introducing stateful changes into

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,639
spinnaker your early evaluation of

00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:21,810
spinnaker is going to get much more

00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,639
complex and much quicker so we didn't

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,860
have constraints at the same time don't

00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,240
pick the most simplistic app we've seen

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,980
that happen as well where you pick a

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,259
really really simple app and it kind of

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,689
proves nothing to nobody and it becomes

00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,709
a trivial exercise and you really just

00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:36,060
kind of have to start over again with

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,949
another that it is a good learning

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,660
experience to learn spinnaker but

00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:43,949
doesn't serve you well in the evaluation

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:46,199
purpose all right so the other one that

00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:50,850
we've learned is single person

00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:53,910
evaluations and poorly so we've gone

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,589
into large company before we start

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,680
working with this one DevOps engineer

00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:00,870
just one and then what happens is you

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,459
start breeding it's like jealousy and

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,740
hate from all the other DevOps engineers

00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,329
that are outside of the room I have no

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,079
idea what's happening in terms of the

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:12,539
evaluation so I want to be a part of it

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:17,610
and want to exercise their opinions and

00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:22,780
ideas but but have no way to be heard

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:25,150
on the other hand we did a POC with Fox

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,720
and I went fantastic and I went

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:31,330
fantastic because we included four to

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,180
five different team members from

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,010
different teams so people from security

00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,250
stopped by to do part of the evaluates

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,050
in the networking team people from

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,790
different application teams all came and

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,800
were part of it and it turned what would

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:48,760
have been three week maybe even a

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:51,000
three-month period of evaluation into

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,100
just a couple days and by the third day

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,260
we presented our results to the

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,990
executive team they were seeing what we

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,450
had done they were all bought in into

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,920
spinnaker and it went really really well

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,620
and it's still going well because you

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,870
still have those teams still invested

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,730
inside of spinnaker and are doing the

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:19,330
work and their opinions were bird and

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:20,950
incorporated into the evaluation so this

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:24,850
is back to Tamara's point so how do you

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,500
convince people that spinnaker doesn't

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,630
necessarily have more bugs like I think

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,120
one way is of course with the the large

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,920
open source community and we keep track

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
of how fast it's growing it's growing at

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,550
an incredible rate but the other thing

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,440
is you really need to build trust with

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,890
inside of your organization spinnaker is

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,930
the new tool so people don't fully know

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,250
about spinnaker and its value but if it

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,270
keeps going down and it keeps breaking

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,080
and it keeps having perceived problems

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:53,380
then people are going to start

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,760
criticizing it a little bit unfairly so

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,530
the first part is really start with one

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,930
provider at a time the reason I mention

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:02,860
this is because enterprises are now

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:06,040
going through this trend of I guess

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,860
being provider agnostic and I think

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,410
that's certainly a good goal to have and

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,850
spinnaker provides that value shortly

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,620
but there's a bunch of other value that

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,270
spinnaker provides in a bunch of other

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,790
hurdles and things you have to prove

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:22,840
before proving that spinnaker is truly

00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,490
spinnaker cloud agnostic so work with

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,990
one provider on there's a lot of

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,090
configuration options that need to be

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,160
put into spinnaker to make each cloud

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,770
provider to happen and have a footwork

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,140
well starting with many we've seen that

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,550
fail and we end up in just configuration

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,260
land and not proving anything with

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,660
spinnaker so great we got all these

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,340
cloud providers configured and there's a

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,010
whole bunch of kind of sort of math that

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,290
comes with that but nothing has actually

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,780
been proven and that thing is of course

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:55,030
is working with Fiat as soon as possible

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:59,140
reason why is because the reason why is

00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:01,210
because spinnaker is a fairly permissive

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,460
system and needs to be in order to

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,890
deploy resources into whatever account

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,870
so it has access to a lot of different

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,450
things with inside of Amazon or Google

00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,340
to be able to deploy these resources so

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,620
you really want to lock this down early

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,570
so you can have a strong security story

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,180
with the security team which will come

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,590
by and which will start asking questions

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,020
earlier than not so being able to figure

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,700
how Fiat works with your accounts and

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,100
your applications and how you can type

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,200
down pipe lines the one thing that I've

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,830
realized going for benefice enterprise

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,540
is that each each Enterprise has a

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,520
different security model there's some

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,440
that just want to lock down by account

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,240
there's some that want to dock found by

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,020
applications there's some that wanted to

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,840
have lock down by pipelines in being

00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,070
able to deploy to prod and so being able

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,290
to have a strong story is really

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,670
important before people get on the other

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,670
side and start criticizing this new

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:57,070
technology that they're learning about

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,080
the next step is monitoring which you

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,660
know there was a talk this morning about

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,980
operationalizing spinnaker so I won't

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,780
touch too much into this but there's

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,660
three ways of monitoring spinnaker

00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,940
there's the the aggregated metrics so

00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,430
these are just the raw metrics that come

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,750
out of spinnaker there's the application

00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,840
logs these are things that have

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:20,080
exceptions stack traces and then the

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,330
last one is audit logs that come out of

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,310
echo so for those that are new to

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,200
spinnaker every transaction in every

00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,990
event that happens within spinnaker by a

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,180
user or otherwise flows into a system

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:34,120
called echo and then from there you can

00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,610
pipe that system or pipe those logs and

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,650
events to other systems so other

00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,960
centralized logging like Splunk or

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,640
elastic search or we've seen other

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,390
people pipe that into a my sequel

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,570
database

00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,580
and apply a query layer on top of that

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,130
so that apply that allows you to get

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,130
audit ability and compliance you can

00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:56,290
start doing searches on who did what

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,000
when and where and that's critical for

00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,890
being able to get back to the security

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,140
team being able to have a good story

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,059
around why you want spinnaker not only

00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,350
does it solve our deployment problem but

00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,510
guess what it helps out with compliance

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,850
as well and the last piece which is a

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,100
little bit it's small and easy to

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,240
configure it's notifications but it's

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,940
really important for you to be proactive

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,650
as application teams are getting onboard

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,630
and onto spinnaker and start looking at

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,010
spinnaker you want to be proactive to be

00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,780
notified if there's any pipeline

00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,250
failures because people with new

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,200
technologies get frustrated and very

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,299
very quickly and if you're not there to

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,830
help them little just criticize

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:32,080
spinnaker unfairly and then just leave

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:37,299
and that's opposite to what you're

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,330
trying to do with spinnaker so once you

00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:41,320
have been running you've done all of the

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,000
configuration and all the things that we

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,610
just talked about you're gonna want to

00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,559
start working on a pipeline so the next

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,900
mistake we see is that we create we go

00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,030
in we set it a lot to get an application

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,120
but they create a super simplistic

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,700
pipeline as the eval and said cool I can

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,679
deploy a spinnaker and it's great to

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,450
have something simple but it has to be

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,429
accurate to the way that you deployed

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,250
with inside of your organization jumping

00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:08,950
to a very simple deploy doesn't really

00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,929
prove anything and you'll end up getting

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,580
people like saying oh this is great but

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,830
this won't actually work for our use

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,390
case because X Y and C so you're going

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:20,770
to want to model your actual workflow

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:23,110
and make sure that that is accurate so

00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,820
try to keep it as simple as possible the

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,710
other thing is don't add to autumn too

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,540
much automation at the beginning people

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,940
get freaked out with automation going

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,880
from hey here's our full manual workflow

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,340
- here's a fully automated workflow to

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,360
production that's a good way to scare

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,220
people then you've set in your

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,990
organization and stop the evaluation

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,570
immediately so I mean we've literally

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,610
seen people not want to use vinegar

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,919
because there's a chance that you can

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:51,070
get to automation it's just not to me

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,080
but that's the type of people that are

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,700
in enterprises that are working against

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,220
change and you know bring in something

00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:03,190
like spinnaker and and it's opinion

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:06,190
framework is tough to get over all right

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:10,419
so what sex make sure you try to get

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:12,820
that one application into production now

00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:14,470
not isn't the case in all cases you can

00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,490
do that getting an application of

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:20,919
production may require additional checks

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,710
and review boards but try to get into

00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,000
production to prove an end-to-end test

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,460
that's definitely the best way to prove

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,110
its value don't forget to compare back

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,240
to the baseline that we checked that

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,220
data and the metrics that you've

00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,690
collected are essentially going to be

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,340
what you're going to use to go back to

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,929
the executive team to go back to

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,299
application teams to be able to show

00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:44,320
them why this is so much better than the

00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:46,929
world you had before evaluation time

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,120
varies greatly just based on who's

00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:52,600
available the resources that you have in

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,700
order to evaluate it so it may take one

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,679
or two months but the more resources you

00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,549
can get involved early on it will reduce

00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:02,260
it down to one or two weeks or even less

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:03,640
and the next thing is really just

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,679
getting other teams to experiment with

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,039
spinnaker and onboarding and adoption

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,370
and I'll have Ben here go through that

00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,429
Thanks

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,929
so I talked about how to evaluate

00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:15,880
spinnaker I'm gonna talk a bit about

00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,559
once you've decided that you want to use

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,470
spinnaker how do you actually drive

00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:22,919
adoption within your company want to go

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,169
back to this slide for just one second

00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:29,260
related to building trust there's been a

00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:32,409
couple instances where we did a POC with

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,950
the enterprise company and seemingly

00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:38,470
successful people see where we got

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,669
deployed to an environment pre crowd

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,280
were prod and then some time went by and

00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:46,450
we were wondering why aren't you giving

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,370
spinnaker to the other application teams

00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,010
let's let's get going here and the

00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:53,559
reason is because specifically the

00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,390
reasons we didn't have Fiat and if you

00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,780
take all of these things and probably a

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,760
couple a couple extra things as like if

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:04,419
you lump them together we call this

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,370
production readiness and the definition

00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:08,980
of production readiness varies from

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,240
company to company but generally it's

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,809
things of things that you need to have

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,519
like

00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:15,450
eh a type of system something is

00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:18,759
scalable repeatable with failover

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:21,309
notifications monitoring and Emin Fossey

00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:22,960
which has been critical so we could this

00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:24,399
has been a recent learning and so now

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,320
one of the things that we try to do is

00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:30,129
just get to production readiness as fast

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,649
as possible so that the central DevOps

00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:34,419
or platform team feels comfortable and

00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:41,110
trust vinegar enough to hand it off to

00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:43,350
their applications okay so how do you

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:47,559
actually get adoption in your enterprise

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:49,570
we often talk about or describe it as a

00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:52,320
combination of people process and

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:55,629
technology and actually in that order

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,279
when I say people what I mean are kind

00:26:55,629 --> 00:27:00,519
of what's your value system what's your

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,950
philosophy and getting alignment from

00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:06,009
really the top to the bottom of your

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:09,749
organization things like service

00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:12,159
ownership and a tool expediter maybe

00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:14,169
spinnaker might be a bit unique compared

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,749
to other types of dev tools where it has

00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:18,789
so much surface area in your company it

00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:20,379
really affects everyone in the

00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:22,240
organization versus there's other tools

00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:24,850
that maybe you can get a lot of value

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,429
from just as an individual or a small

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:30,940
team I believe Spinnaker's is different

00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:33,429
so getting alignment from the folks

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,350
inside your company which is clearly the

00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:37,090
hardest thing and this is another

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,070
learning that we went through

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:42,070
okay so then once you have alignment

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,080
around service ownership what are the

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:49,179
processes that come out of that things

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,820
like CI CD automated testing agile etc

00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:52,720
and if you do those first two things

00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,879
they're actually in a really good spot

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,340
the last piece of the puzzle is really

00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:58,869
the technology and we're all here

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,509
because of spinnaker spinning was a

00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:03,340
fantastic tool for this but it doesn't

00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:06,100
have to be it could be a custom tool

00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:08,440
that what we did let's share this that

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:12,519
Andrew wrote and then you know they're

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,200
in a good spot I believe but you know

00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,519
once you have those two things you know

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,679
what is the technology that can enable

00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:20,750
the processes and the value system that

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,020
you all agree on and by the way

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:26,240
we we kind of flip this so we made the

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,800
mistake of flipping this order we would

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,540
go into a company and start working with

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,840
them and we would lead with spinnaker

00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:35,210
and we experienced a lot of friction by

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,760
doing that because people didn't really

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:39,500
agree with like the value system the

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,940
spinnaker provides soar that that the

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,530
opinions that adds around immutable

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,230
infrastructure and the source ownership

00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:49,610
and therefore a lot of pushback so now

00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:52,280
always always this order so I'm a

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:55,250
product guy but I think this holds true

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,830
for any type of sweeping change in an

00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:00,590
organization deployments is no different

00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,880
and to be honest we learned this from

00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,410
the workout guys

00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,650
Alex and Randy we're gonna be giving a

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,020
talk I think it one on your journey with

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,270
spinnaker but it's really treat

00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,680
deployments as the product just like you

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,660
would any external product that your

00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,600
company sells or provides to your

00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:21,290
customers as a central platform team

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,510
that manages an upgrade spinnaker your

00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,250
customers are the the chronic engineers

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,910
the application teams that are using it

00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:31,610
and so things like the surveys customer

00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,870
interviews measuring success so the

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,840
things that Issac talked about around

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:37,100
time to deploy manual steps those are

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,160
the types of things that you're probably

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,300
gonna want to measure and improve on if

00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,270
you're treating that you really have

00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,150
true responsibility and ownership

00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:49,610
creating a project plan POC alpha-beta

00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:54,710
GA all the things that you would do for

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:58,340
a product an external product here's an

00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:00,860
example of a project plan that we try to

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:04,550
execute with our customers so we start

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:07,970
with the POC phase and evaluation that I

00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:10,400
adopted talked about surveying the teams

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,990
especially in a large company it's very

00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,730
valuable

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,980
you may have dozens or even hundreds of

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,260
teams each team is probably doing

00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,260
something a little bit different and so

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,670
trying to understand how do how do teams

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,760
deployed today what are the tools that

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:28,180
they use what

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,920
how how urgent is that pain point for a

00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,720
big company it may be hard to get this

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,730
information the surveys is a great way I

00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,430
mean face to face conversation is a

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:39,370
little bit early death but the purpose

00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:42,520
of this is to identify who is that team

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:44,710
that should be you know involved for the

00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,950
POC and then execute on the PST

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,800
then like something like an alpha

00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,870
you know select the team gets getting an

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,450
application into production and then

00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:57,790
after you complete that phase celebrate

00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,610
that win do a presentation do like in

00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:02,530
engineering all hands where you talk

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,170
about the benefits of spinnaker what you

00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,790
did that before and after and try to get

00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:09,070
momentum hopefully after that

00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,570
presentation you have more teams those

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,030
in the hands of saying I want to be part

00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,950
of the beta and in the beta you want to

00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,460
select working so let's say three to

00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,920
five teams were apps get them on board

00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,170
in deploying to production and probably

00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,930
expanding the use cases so maybe you

00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,190
deploy to ec2 but maybe you also have a

00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,320
couple teams that are doing kubernetes

00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,380
so I want to expand these cases a bit

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,270
and again celebrate the wins and then a

00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:41,590
ga launched where it's available to

00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:46,600
everyone and this takes time months so

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:49,090
another thing that we try to do is to to

00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,930
sell the features the specific features

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:54,910
of spinnaker to the right people in a

00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:58,240
company especially a large organization

00:31:54,910 --> 00:32:01,510
and we we bucket where we see these

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,830
these features across two dimensions one

00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,930
is the carrot and the stick

00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,640
dimension where the carrot are things

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,320
that the end user the application

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,420
engineer they really really want

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,970
something like Canaries is an example of

00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:15,760
that where the stick is something that

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:19,360
maybe the the buyer or maybe the VP

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,460
Avenger see Mike a single path to

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,030
production for developer efficiency or

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,980
maybe cost savings and they could impose

00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,660
a bit of a mandate and say hey we're

00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,780
gonna save a lot of money if everyone's

00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,730
using spinnaker and so have to do it

00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,530
versus the carrot features aren't hey

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,810
this is awesome

00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:40,020
tell my friends about it the other

00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:43,080
dimension is this concept of sweeping

00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,080
glass or crawling over glass and so

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,900
imagine a field of glass and on one side

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,940
there is a spinnaker Nirvana this is

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,490
like where we all want to be and on the

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,870
other side is your your application

00:32:53,490 --> 00:33:01,470
teams so Ken can you sell a feature or

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:04,140
ability feature a spinnaker future that

00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,420
that MIT is so valuable that the

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,370
application engineer is gonna call over

00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:11,700
that glass to get there because it's so

00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,170
valuable or do you have to kind of sweep

00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,790
the glass to make it easier for them

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:19,020
that's kind of the way that we think

00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:20,580
about some of these features and this is

00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,230
this should be pretty familiar to you

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,870
guys in wharton chart you know where you

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:27,240
have you know the devops or platform

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:29,670
teams which is probably most of you guys

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,550
and then the application teams and we

00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:36,690
just highlighted the you know red and

00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:38,880
green the the stick features kind of

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,400
applied to red and it's red because it's

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,420
a stick and then you know green features

00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,190
is just the way that we you know the

00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,860
caret features these are the ones that

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,720
we retry this a little more to the

00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,210
application teams and focus on those

00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,730
because the application engineer may not

00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,340
care about how much money they say for

00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:04,290
how efficient the resources are being

00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:08,940
utilized so everything that we've

00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:11,880
presented here is on a blog post go to

00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,649
army that io / playbook closes publicly

00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,649
available for you guys to consume

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,290
the world map use Illustrated that is

00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:28,290
the for its chunk up and give you go

00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:30,389
back to develop slides with online the

00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:35,419
four cubes or five cubes

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:39,230
yeah that's for the initial sort of like

00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:42,210
onboarding per se for that DevOps team

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:45,000
that you mentioned right about the

00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,339
iterative users within the organization

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,329
how does that look like in terms of the

00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:54,119
timeline yeah so good question the

00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:57,500
onboarding period is probably up to up

00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,180
to here this GA launch my definition is

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,849
available to all teams meaning like

00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,260
whatever use cases you guys have

00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:07,170
integrations that you with your existing

00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:10,079
tooling is ready so that all the teams

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:12,329
can want on board if they want to but

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,760
that's that's a challenge in and of

00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:18,079
itself and it's probably going to

00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,849
involve training and some hand-holding

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,579
so you guys did you say that you have

00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:26,910
about ten percent or less of your les

00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:38,130
right now and the convincing is don't

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:40,770
battle yeah so I would recommend talking

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,329
to this group of folks versus this group

00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,950
of folks differently and seeing just

00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:45,930
what works in your organization I mean

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,990
I'm definitely in the red I know you're

00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:51,480
in the red but there may be a future

00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:54,150
here that you can sell that creates

00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,640
immunity and sense but we've experienced

00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,920
the seven other companies where the

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,560
buyer or the kind of engineering leader

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,490
says everyone has to do this because

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,319
above X in other cases spinnaker might

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,849
be is just so good for application teams

00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:10,650
everyone wants to get the CD so badly

00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:13,500
that they're motivated to crawl over

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,540
that glass and get there so it's just

00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,670
it's different for each organization to

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,400
provide some context if we were to have

00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,750
25% of our applications on board we

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,700
probably be one of the largest players

00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,920
in the spinnaker space or if that's how

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,300
many we're dealing with and I think

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,269
we're at the point now where we just

00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,639
have to

00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,779
let's it look like so the people who

00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,029
have autumn order to have hours fold

00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:36,219
carrots you know and that the other

00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:38,079
people just it's almost gonna have to

00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:40,509
come from the developers at this point

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,009
because the mandates there but if they

00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:44,009
will follow the mandate I mean it's well

00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:51,449
it's interesting a corporate mentality

00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:55,359
but the mandate is there but the time or

00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:59,649
okay so it's not mandate it's not the

00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,119
time box demand a strong schedule have

00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:03,519
you tried putting the the people who

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,559
River gloves spinnaker like two of them

00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,379
in a room with one who doesn't really

00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:11,169
like Spanish that's very easy to do a

00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:13,509
couple well each finding that doesn't

00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:16,569
like very easy well if you outnumber and

00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:18,279
with ones that have you like and if they

00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:21,159
have mutual respect for each other

00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:22,869
it might might find success and the one

00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:25,919
thing that I didn't mention as well as

00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:28,509
like it's really getting into the next

00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:30,189
trying to find that one top tier app

00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:32,499
that is whether you're special painter

00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:33,849
was saying and figuring out going back

00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,799
to that's a really good point figuring

00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:39,129
out like what is it that that tier one

00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:43,239
team needs either spinnaker doesn't have

00:37:39,129 --> 00:37:45,399
or maybe spinnaker isn't necessarily

00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,359
addressing in their concerns and you

00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:47,979
know there's a bunch of community

00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:49,089
members here that you can either come

00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:51,069
back to or build it yourself internally

00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:55,299
for us just to share it with support

00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:56,469
right now we it would be appearance to

00:37:55,299 --> 00:38:01,479
the rest of our community was that one

00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:03,219
rights more general so we've taken that

00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,109
now we're doing full time support I

00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:07,119
think that'll be the biggest just to

00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:10,299
what Isaac was saying I remember Andy

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,459
told us a story about when Netflix first

00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:15,069
started working on spinnaker and driving

00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:16,539
the adoption there was I can't remember

00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:19,449
maybe Tomas you do you know the name of

00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:21,369
the app there was some tier one app that

00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:23,889
on boarded onto spinnaker into very

00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:25,779
early days and after that like all the

00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:27,639
Domino's phone because it was such an

00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:30,459
important app so if you can identify

00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,649
that long pole intent and like work

00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:36,729
really hard to get that team on worded

00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:39,009
it may have the other thing we do in

00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:41,329
terms of support which is I was

00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:44,209
mentioning the the echo logs that have

00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:46,549
Venson them as we monitor pipeline

00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:48,529
failures and so typically if we see a

00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:51,229
spike in pipeline failures with our

00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:53,420
customers it's not that they're failing

00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:55,969
because it's its exception it's more

00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,249
that they typically fail because they

00:38:55,969 --> 00:39:00,229
set up their yell be wrong right and

00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:02,509
there was another talk I think yesterday

00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:04,160
that was saying like or earlier this

00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:06,440
morning which is they have to keep

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,690
reminding it's not spinnaker it's your

00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,680
app right that's you typically what

00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,089
happens is most people like ah

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,779
Spinnaker's broken it's like no you

00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:16,670
didn't configure your app correctly put

00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:17,989
that to the side for a second but at

00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:21,109
least you can be proactive about it so

00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:23,119
when you see alerts or accept pilot

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,380
failures happen you jump into the slack

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,719
channel you're proactive and you're

00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,029
there and it's and it saves a lot of

00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:54,170
frustration otherwise they're just going

00:39:29,029 --> 00:40:05,359
to be cursing at the entire time into

00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:07,579
the story but you're fair so so I think

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,569
it's mostly just like I mean if I'm at

00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:14,390
stage one company but if I'm already a

00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:15,799
tree me let's say stage 3 yeah what's

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,779
the approach like what was the

00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:20,329
evaluation you gotta provide that so

00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:22,219
I'll actually say that we can't work

00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:24,469
with the stage one company but there's a

00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:28,729
ton of other problems that we just can't

00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:30,140
help you too many problems there's an

00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:32,809
activity a set of activities that you

00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,459
get from stage 1 stage 2 and as Daniel

00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:38,979
mentioned you can't jump from page 1 to

00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:41,869
stage 3 word to 5 it has to be serial

00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:44,209
and so if you're here if you're in stage

00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:46,479
2 you're still doing mutable deployments

00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:48,829
you're still logging in the boxes I

00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:50,180
would argue you can't even use spinnaker

00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,619
at this point there's a set of

00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,549
activities that you still need to do

00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,090
like DevOps

00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:57,240
types of activities to break

00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:59,580
like a big monolith or to separate your

00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,780
data stores there's like that has to

00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,550
happen before you can even take

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,320
advantage of fingers we actually look

00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:06,090
for companies at age three that are

00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,370
already on the more sophisticated and

00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,870
already doing CD to some extent maybe

00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:12,450
with an annual gate before production

00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:14,970
already immutable because the

00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:17,100
progression on to spinnaker is much much

00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,720
smoother if you're here and you want to

00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,610
work where you want to adopt spinnaker

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,870
if you're here there's all that there's

00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:25,500
that chunky piece of work that has to

00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:27,510
happen first so we actually we love

00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:31,170
working with with companies and in this

00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:33,570
in this scenario because our goal and

00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,890
our objective as armory is to get as

00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,410
many companies in this stage five as

00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:39,960
possible we have a stage two customer

00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:42,180
right now and they actually they can't

00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,190
use spinnaker we ended up bringing in a

00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,580
DevOps consulting job to help retrofit

00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,750
the first app which is info about the

00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,060
way that we recommend doing a dad

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:54,210
reasons for wanting to start with that

00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,590
specific app but they're taking them a

00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,720
little bit of work to basically get

00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:00,840
their app to a state where they can even

00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,570
use spinnaker yeah yes and also I guess

00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,670
a dresser you asked what value do we

00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:08,670
provide to the people who are already

00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:11,520
believe in CBN already doing CT you know

00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:14,550
back to the metrics is people who are

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,610
already clothes doing CD have their

00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:19,170
homegrown tooling so most of that is

00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,970
like getting rid of all this homegrown

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,650
tooling which is breaking so they may be

00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:26,010
doing it but they're stumbling along the

00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:29,040
way and then and and then at that point

00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:30,330
we've gotten company from nothing to

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,300
spinnaker and all of their apps and

00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,470
spinnaker within a month which is like

00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,780
that's the best case because they were

00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:39,720
already doing CD and they got rid of a

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:43,200
ton of common ground' code so the way we

00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,610
evaluated that POC was how much how many

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,170
lines of code that they have to support

00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,270
do they no longer have to support

00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:50,040
because of that and we help them we help

00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:53,190
them operationalize spinnaker and

00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,620
support them using spinnaker so then

00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:58,470
that even that create that's the value

00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:00,240
to them in addition to that what we

00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:02,430
found is I even though people assume

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,020
that they're doing CD they always have

00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:07,660
like one or two manual steps and then we

00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,670
work with them to kind of get get them

00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,170
on the spinnaker and start reading like

00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,790
getting rid of that one and one or two

00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,230
manual steps that they kind of

00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,110
overlooked for and they didn't have that

00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:30,280
person to code the homegrown tooling to

00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:34,060
make our experience so we work with

00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:39,520
those companies as well so you know

00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:44,170
spinnaker does deploy two windows a.m.

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,660
eyes inside of AWS we do stand-up

00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:50,290
spinnaker on a bunch of machines

00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,700
typically or sent off machines but we've

00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,470
seen we've worked with them as well and

00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,200
they're able to deploy we've also seen a

00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:59,560
lot of people go building on dotnet and

00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:03,330
then start a framework called ionic core

00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:06,790
dotnet cork so moving to diamond core

00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:09,100
and then I think there is some as your

00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:12,370
support seen some people I don't know

00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,930
how much jobs are supported it's there

00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:29,950
there's a couple things that are missing

00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:31,930
Bravo balance just after 30 n yeah so

00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,700
ground truth you guys contributed the

00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:37,320
Packer template that does the making of

00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:41,620
the is correct and we're entirely

00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:44,440
entirely most or ETL is not but we were

00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:48,670
all windows net now Ron dotnet core for

00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:52,570
anything but yeah is there does that

00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:56,440
answer your question yeah do you guys

00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:58,600
allow its in terms of user support do

00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,400
you allow your customers to like I

00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,440
should go in and muck with the internals

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,580
of spinnaker and like you know set their

00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,800
own configurations and whatnot like they

00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,560
wanted to add an additional email

00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,600
address for their notifications like

00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,330
who's responsible and your institution

00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,539
so usually there's a DevOps engineer who

00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:19,359
it

00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:22,569
who's the administrator or the team is

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,979
the administrates spinnaker so they yeah

00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:24,459
they go in and they change things like

00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:28,179
that

00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:29,469
I said I'm surprised nobody has asked

00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:33,819
for and I'm waiting for that other shoe

00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:35,289
to drop for app dev teams to be

00:45:33,819 --> 00:45:36,969
self-sufficient and configuring new

00:45:35,289 --> 00:45:38,949
credentials and configurations for their

00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:42,789
application instead of having to go

00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:46,599
through central dev ops team so if I may

00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:49,179
address that my team actually extended

00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,789
the UI for the application profile to

00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:53,799
offer children he thought he owned and

00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:57,099
type of application profile within

00:45:53,799 --> 00:46:00,189
spinnaker so we are offering that can i

00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:02,859
pattern for individual engineering team

00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:04,329
to enter their potentials in addition

00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:06,640
information that describes their

00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:14,650
application but it is indeed a

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:16,390
customization it's a it's a full UI

00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,579
customization that definitely needs some

00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,349
some redesign work to make it fit back

00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:21,640
in you scrub it a little bit and also

00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:23,289
yeah it's actually not me just there's

00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,299
you I obviously put under underlying

00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:26,919
it's about yes pending Fiat together

00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:30,069
right now that Jenkins master is open to

00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:32,229
everybody so everything yeah so before

00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:33,959
we get into a transmission journey we

00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:36,839
have to get a grave a Fiat definitely

00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:38,890
would be happy

00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:40,479
nobody's really brought that up yeah

00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:42,519
like they're worried about a lot of

00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:43,959
other things and then kind of overlooked

00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:55,479
the fact those people pulling everything

00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:57,309
from Jenkins security questions you guys

00:46:55,479 --> 00:47:06,150
have that I've got one more question for

00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:08,529
you in your kind of service offering

00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:12,309
which is why I was asking about the it

00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:14,589
sound like coaching opportunities beyond

00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:17,009
initial onboarding process do you have

00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:20,459
service offering for the Kings whose

00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:23,829
evolution uses adoption right the

00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:25,140
Alliance model to keep partnering with

00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:27,210
your user

00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,579
many company you've already on board

00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,960
yeah so we're a product company we're

00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:33,299
not a consulting company but we do offer

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,859
very deep levels of support to enable

00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:37,519
the success of our customers to use

00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:40,589
spinnaker you know our our goal or

00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:43,319
mission is to get companies towards 8/5

00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:45,119
as quickly as possible so a lot of what

00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:47,220
we've been doing is just extending

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:51,720
spinnaker for in specific enterprise

00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:54,839
needs and use cases actually go back to

00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,150
this slide here we talk about carrot and

00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:59,039
stick that's very much my interest

00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:05,930
actually I'll let then talk a little bit

00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:15,569
about this slide here basically funny

00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:16,740
evangelizing continually means that

00:48:15,569 --> 00:48:21,630
answer your question we do provide

00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:24,630
support as as you embark on this vinegar

00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:27,329
journey we would help our customers

00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:29,369
throughout the entire lifecycle but in

00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:32,190
terms of the this type of carrot or a

00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:35,279
stick again it's different for each

00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:37,680
company some create a mandate where

00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:40,619
there are deadlines and all teams must

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,690
onboard by specific date and in other

00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:47,210
cases there or not and it's much more

00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:52,140
open and developer or I just application

00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:53,880
engineer which is where we like to focus

00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,869
on on the carrot so what are the things

00:48:53,880 --> 00:49:00,450
that we can build or we can sell in

00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:03,299
evangelize to those teams to encourage

00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:05,130
and motivate them to to adopt spinnaker

00:49:03,299 --> 00:49:05,819
and it's really just it's a process of

00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,980
experimentation

00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:10,799
you don't each company is different and

00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:13,319
each individual people's motivations are

00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:15,299
different so again treating treating

00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:16,710
deployments like a product you go

00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:19,440
through this iterative cycle and you

00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:21,089
learn so our probably offering today is

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,000
for example we have an installer for you

00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:26,849
AWS installs and Google use spinnaker an

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,190
H a and we have our murid lighthouse

00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:30,210
just monitoring zero downtime upgrades

00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,190
things like that just things that

00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:34,079
enterprises want to be able to get up

00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,660
and running quickly and we've been

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,990
experimenting with

00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:43,810
current feature called barometer which

00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:47,390
is an ACA engine to be able to do

00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:49,180
automated Canaries and rollbacks based

00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:52,070
on data doggin elasticsearch

00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:55,120
intelligence you know things to get

00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:57,830
companies towards stage by basically so

00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,580
one last question for all of you I'd

00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:02,660
love to know what you think about this

00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:06,700
formula that we're playing around with

00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:10,760
to try to measure confident deployment

00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,570
velocity I just going into the you can

00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,960
only improve what you can measure

00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:17,390
thought process here you know if you had

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,400
a way to show the Delta between before

00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,230
spinnaker and after spinnaker and there

00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,640
was some kind of a formula and I don't

00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:24,020
know if it's this I that actually love

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,630
to know if if you would find this to be

00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:29,720
valuable just any feedback that you have

00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:31,820
on this they don't have anything now you

00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,860
can also think about it but who actually

00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,270
measures their SLA I just realized they

00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,840
didn't mention it all actually has who

00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:41,240
actually has SLS for their internal

00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:45,850
traps okay what is it

00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,850
I'm curious what is it what are you 100%

00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,160
that's a call Oh Billy

00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:24,420
so we see we actually noticed that a lot

00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:27,660
of people don't even measure the SLA

00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:29,490
yeah we're totally down ten dollars in

00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:32,700
SLA anything less than a hundred percent

00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:34,740
would be like well so an SLA doesn't

00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,690
necessarily just mean uptime SLA it

00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,000
could be decoration of service right so

00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:41,370
like your response times go from 100

00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,990
milliseconds to 600 milliseconds so the

00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:45,720
commerce companies that we work with

00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:47,400
that's basically you know millions of

00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,850
dollars of loss for the year going from

00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,680
100 to 600 and so that's why we are very

00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:54,270
specific about using the word SLA and

00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,790
not just downtime we started with

00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:58,500
downtime but then we never go down okay

00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:00,390
well every word that's nest hello I

00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,460
think it might get a higher hit rate if

00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:05,040
you did that since because almost every

00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:08,970
team has an SLO site at Google very few

00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,960
teams of SLA it was getting fired if we

00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:13,530
don't mean it we're getting yelled out a

00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,370
lot though this is more can we show at

00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:19,220
Delta before-and-after vinegar that

00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:21,690
executives can understand and can really

00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,790
use that to then drive a mandate or

00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:25,890
drive adoption and is that that bottom

00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:27,540
number is gonna affect what like what

00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,880
your actual score is and like you can

00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,110
say you want three nines like in your

00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,940
example here but like there's a

00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:35,130
significant difference to go to three

00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,350
nines to four nines to five nines like

00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,780
that's that's a huge amount of it makes

00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:43,440
much difference in there and that number

00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:45,630
yeah you know the matter in thinking of

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,580
a good denominator well so one one thing

00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:50,130
about that is what we find is that a lot

00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:53,550
of times people erroneously think that

00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:56,190
speed equals less safety and so even if

00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:59,280
it's just that the numerators increasing

00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:02,550
and you know the denominator isn't

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,410
decreasing that alone would help show

00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,520
that you and also I think there's I can

00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:07,890
have some other variables missing like

00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,770
that tt-rs missing from you okay that's

00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:11,559
good I think me making that the point

00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,299
minutes versus

00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,809
measuring the percentage of successful

00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:18,729
deployments or still is because you can

00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:21,369
you can deploy a thousand containers and

00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:23,729
if 900 those are bad your fuel number

00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:27,099
the privilege still gonna be very high

00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:31,479
we don't to make it good but we do want

00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:33,670
to make it valuable right alright thanks

00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:36,599
you have a chat more thing we're gonna

00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:36,599
