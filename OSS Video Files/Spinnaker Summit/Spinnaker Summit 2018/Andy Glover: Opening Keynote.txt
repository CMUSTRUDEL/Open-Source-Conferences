yes welcome to the 2018 spinnaker summit

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,790
it is indeed a legit conference now in

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,440
fact if someone was saying because we're

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,289
in a hotel that means we are legit as

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:21,029
opposed to last year's summit where it

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:23,369
was ultimately at Netflix and I put it

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,680
together and it was a blast

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,970
but I learned quickly that I never ever

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,439
want to plan a conference again but I do

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,540
want to say thanks for everyone that

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,489
that came last year and it's obviously

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,290
back this year the feedback we got after

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,250
last year was we need to do this again

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,300
just not at Netflix probably somewhere

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,090
nicer or something anyways so I want to

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,329

with his his phenomenal keynote that is

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:16,720
gonna be the best keynote ever so I want

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,150
to take you through what's happened over

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,010
the last year with spinnaker and so it

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,560
has been a it's been a phenomenal year

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,540
spinnaker and in more than one way has

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,780
just grown tremendously and last year

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,130
we've seen a 45 increase 45 percent

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,620
increase and the number of contributors

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:39,700
contributors across a handful of github

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,769
repos and I think many of you who are

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,600
part of that stat are here today in the

00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:47,650
last 60 days alone we've had over a

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,290
thousand PRS our slack channel which

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,290
hopefully everyone is a member of has as

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,200
of yesterday five thousand four hundred

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,739
and seventy-one members communicating

00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,570
across 62 channels one thing that I have

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,600
noted is more than one person throughout

00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,510
the year has suggested that we we we no

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,590
longer use the free version of slack

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,079
which i think is a great idea does

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,980
anyone know how slack charges anyone

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:18,919
from slack here

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:20,930
it's $7 a user per month that's like 40

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,590
grand a month so I'm looking for

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,030
volunteers to Deponia that up but yeah

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,110
we got to figure that one out we have

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,720
some friends at slack so we'll have a

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,700
couple conversations but we will look to

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,380
see what we can do about making slack

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,290
the enterprise version where you know

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,910
you don't lose history and whatnot but

00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:42,729
needless to say we have a lot of people

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:45,410
on slack and we've added quite a few

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:48,100
different logos to spinnaker i/o over

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,419
the last year I know this is not

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,030
everybody or every company that's

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,630
leveraging spinnaker so if you do want

00:04:53,030 --> 00:05:05,210
your your company's logo up there please

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:07,639
send us a PR we've spun up a community

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,650
forum in fact at last year's summit this

00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,560
is one of the the ask that came out

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,530
people said hey because you are using

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,750
the free version of slack you cheapos we

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,530
lose history conversations get lost we

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,600
want something a little bit more

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,450
permanent so we we actually were

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,400
listening and we set up discourse and

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,889
you can get to it at community that's

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,690
been occur do this is a you know slack

00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,910
is great for real-time conversations but

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,460
sometimes those conversations get lost

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,070
so this is an excellent place to engage

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:43,940
in discussions ask questions and propose

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:47,750
new features and I'm really excited that

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:50,539
this year a couple of folks wrote a

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,780
spinnaker book those folks are Emily

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:57,050

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,310

like lambda integration Fargate

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,889

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,540
canary analysis to the masses Kanto was

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:08,650
released early this year to a lot of

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,690
fanfare for what it's worth at Netflix

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,840
we leverage automated canary analysis

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:16,330
via Kayenta in spinnaker to ensure the

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,380
Netflix experience works for over 30

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,040
million members around the globe it is a

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,280
vital aspect of the

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,690
at Netflix I know that obviously

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,460
canarian is also a vital aspect of

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:34,340
deliberate now excuse me at Google as

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:36,770
well and so it is now Conte is a

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,270
first-class or I should say automated

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,690
canary analysis is now a first-class

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,400
aspect of spinnaker you can use this as

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:49,940
a part of your release process and

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:51,590
better yet it comes out of the box we

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,650
made it to be pluggable so it comes out

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,120
of the box with four data sources or

00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,150
metric sources that you can plug in

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,880
Atlas is what is Netflix's telemetry

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,920
service we provided this integration

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,750
Google added stackdriver and Prometheus

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,840
and then the good folks at armory added

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,330
data dog so thank you very much for all

00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,460
the innovations that you all and the

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,460
community have provided to Kayenta

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:23,420
anyone here heard heard of kubernetes

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,010
yeah obviously kubernetes is you know

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,960
eating the world so to speak it's a

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,370
phenomenal platform and the the Google

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,410
team along with many of you in the

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,750
community have been working to make the

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:41,080
kubernetes experience in spinnaker

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:43,490
amazing and in fact the the v2 provider

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,190
embraces manifest driven deployments

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,200
while upholding the qualities that make

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:52,970
spinnaker such a powerful continuous

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,580
delivery platform there's a ton of talks

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,160
on kubernetes so I suspect they'll be

00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:02,840
quite full lars if you have questions

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,570
just ask lars directly forgot to put

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,800
your cell phone number on this but no

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,110
but thank you for all the community

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,660
who's working here on the kubernetes

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,660
integration and spinnaker it's amazing

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,540
really this year Netflix OSS released

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,680
our container management platform called

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:27,980
Titus Titus powers critical aspects of

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,410
the Netflix business ranging from video

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,210
streaming recommendations machine

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,150
learning Big Data content encoding

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,779
studio technology internal engineering

00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,550
tools and

00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:39,889
their Netflix workloads we have been

00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,769
working on the tightest integration and

00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:44,720
spinnaker since the early days and now

00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:48,220
it is all open sourced and is a

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,810
additional option for container

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:54,680
workloads at your particular company

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:57,769
this year at Netflix we added support

00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,649
for firmware delivery to our open

00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:02,389
connect appliance our open connect

00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:08,209
appliances across the globe so we added

00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:11,269
this into spinnaker Netflix is well

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:13,279
known for obviously leveraging AWS the

00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:16,610
entire control plane of the Netflix

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,920
experience is is in AWS so when you sign

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,740
into Netflix everything you see and

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,800
touch and interact with is ultimately

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,220
served up from AWS however once you

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,959
press play on whatever episode or you

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,839
know piece of content you want to watch

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:35,059
those that stream is actually streamed

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,759
to you from a data center closest to

00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,559
your geographic location and the boxes

00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:44,209
in those data centers are called open

00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:46,399
connect appliances the the team that

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:49,309
owns those boxes or manages those boxes

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,160
regularly does updates to the firmware

00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,870
and they are now leveraging spinnaker so

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,029
this is another example of the

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,040
innovations that you can you can build

00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,709
into spinnaker we of course built this

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,779
platform to be pluggable whether it be

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:05,029
stages whether it be what the artifact

00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,709
you want to deliver or where you want to

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,839
deliver it to so this is a great study

00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:12,290
case study in terms of leveraging

00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,870
spinnaker for various aspects of the

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,550
enterprise

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,709
we've also added first-class support for

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,179
library management by integrating

00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:22,639
spinnaker with an internal Dipel

00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:25,129
dependency management system at Netflix

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,910
this allows library developers to affect

00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:31,309
delivery of their artifacts and gain

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,350
unprecedented visibility into their

00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:35,899
library's consumption across the Netflix

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:39,740
ecosystem again another example of

00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:43,929
extending spinnaker to effect reliable

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,929
safe confident delivery at Netflix

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,320
there's also been a ton of work I know

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,980
spearheaded by the good folks at Google

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,470
on the spinnaker CLI and also we've done

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,800
a lot of work for typed execution

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:08,290
context to allow for artifact tracing

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:10,990
throughout your pipelines so all the

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:14,620
innovation that's happened in the last

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:16,209
year is super incredible but we want to

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,959
make it even easier for people to get

00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:21,640
involved in the spinnaker ecosystem so

00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:23,950
earlier this year both Netflix and

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,350
Google started talking about how we

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,440
could more formalize the project how its

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:33,190
run and clarify how people could get

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,410
involved so I'm really excited to

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,880
announce that both methods and Google

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,760
have worked together and established a

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,790
governance plan very much modeled after

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:47,160
the many is very much modeled in many

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,160
ways after kubernetes governance plan

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:53,320
the plan clarifies how anyone can get

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,720
involved in the project and eventually

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,660
become an approver or committer so

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,020
everyone here in the ecosystem is an

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:05,589
active community member and from there

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:08,500
you can move on to be a formalized for

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:14,560
viewer and then obviously from a

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:16,480
reviewer you can then become there we go

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:23,620
hey doesn't even fit on that one and

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:25,959
approver an approver is a committer the

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,450
plan establishes a technical oversight

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,000
committee that is responsible for the

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:33,640
overall technical management of the

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,579
project and ultimately managing the

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,100
day-to-day running of the project it is

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:44,500
this oversight committee that will

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:48,040
approve reviewers and approvers we also

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,500
established a steering committee the

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,459
responsibility of the steering committee

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,380
is the continual shaping of the

00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:59,980
governance structure of this of this

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,160
project we'll also address questions or

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,449
can

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,169
Stern's from the community about the

00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:07,089
project culture its structure and we

00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:11,470
will attempt to clarify roles and

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:17,230
responsibilities and duties of special

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:20,069
interest groups if you'd like to get

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,439
more information about the new

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:25,510
governance policy it's on the website

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,270
so today the commitment the the

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:31,299
spinnaker ecosystem our community we

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:33,039
have over 40 approvers and I know I

00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,860
speak for everyone in the ecosystem when

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,990
I say next year at this time I'd love

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,390
that number to be a lot higher I think

00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:44,530
what we've learned in the last couple

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:46,870
years is that well first of all we

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,700
didn't really need a governance policy

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,710
out the gate we've we've largely been

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,299
able to function without one however in

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,820
the last year we've come to realise the

00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,289
project is growing it's huge and we want

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,549
to make it an even playing field for

00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:04,090
anyone to get involved this this process

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:05,530
I think clarifies who can get a seat at

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,330
the table and how to get there it's no

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,280
longer this subjective oh you have to

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,750
know you know somebody and be a friend

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,760
of a friend of you know Stephen to get

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:19,630
the to get the nod so to speak and so we

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,980
are most hopeful that by formalizing how

00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:26,169
the project is run that we'll see more

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,409
approvers more reviewers and ultimately

00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:31,750
get more innovations when you innovate

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,970
we all win the more people using

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:37,450
spinnaker is is a plus for all of us and

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,940
so it's our hope that by clarifying how

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:45,610
we govern this project everyone can get

00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:48,730
involved this is a thriving ecosystem as

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:53,590
witnessed by all of us here in Seattle

00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:55,210
for two days it's clear to me that the

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:59,679
more people that use this platform the

00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:02,650
better and so it's my sincere desire

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,450
that everyone gets more formally

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,980
involved in this project and it's not

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:12,280
just you know the domain of Netflix and

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,690
Google and so I hope next year most

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,110
people in this room are somehow involved

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,030
more

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,309
normally with this project I hope it's a

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,490
more inclusive ecosystem where anyone

00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:23,620
can get involved and affect delivery and

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,540
the future of continuous delivery and

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,760
spinnaker so thank you very much I'm

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,330
looking forward to an epic two days and

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:36,620
I hope that I get to meet everyone here

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:41,330
thanks again all right

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,330
[Applause]
