00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:33,200
repository manager works closer here

00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:35,060
with you I'm responsible for our partner

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,560
relationships and the integrations we do

00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,100
with a set of partners and I'm very

00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,160
honored to be here to moderate the panel

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,460
with some really awesome people who know

00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,460
what about spinner that I don't so if

00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,050
you don't know a lot of us vinegar I'm

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,860
more in a great place because I'm gonna

00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,300
ask questions that are selfish for me

00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,030
understanding this vinegar ecosystem and

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,980
how we all can work together to make

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,660
continuous delivery and deployment much

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,509
more seamless part of our CI

00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,620
infrastructure so I want to start with a

00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:13,430
disclaimer disclaimer is that the views

00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:18,200
and positions and information we receive

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:20,510
in this panel are the views of all of us

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,010
and as individuals the six of us here on

00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,150
the panel as individuals and don't

00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,480
represent from the

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,510
our company that gives us free to

00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,820
express ourselves and bring you know our

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,660
points of view into this discussion and

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,920
I hope that's okay so I'm going to start

00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,440
real quickly with a quick introduction

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,360
to each of our panelists just talking to

00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,660
and then we'll start with some questions

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,720
I'll ask a few curves for the panelists

00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,700
asking each other questions because we

00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,390
don't all know each other or like we've

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,740
all done and invite the audience to ask

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:59,119
some questions and then we'll go from

00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:01,550
there so let me start with Richard

deployment of spinnaker and pure and

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:09,769
evangelizing the adoption before joining

00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:12,440
joining pure feminism Sree live mines

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,540
which was acquired by seeking then has

many years of experience in designing

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,320
and implementing solutions at scale Ben

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,489
graduated from the University of

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,709
Adelaide

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,270
majoring in computer science so I hope

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,300
you'll all agree that we've got a really

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,070
awesome panel here and with that I'm

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,840
going to start with the first question

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,740
and I'm going to ask you don't want to

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
use your microphones

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,240
for the new and I guess we'll start

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,830
let's start with Ben and then we cross

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,020
for this first question and we will kind

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,180
of mix it up from there so the first

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,710
question is kind of a softball to get

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,990
introduced about like what you're doing

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,880
actually today with spinnaker so the

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,530
question is where in your organization

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,880
where is your organization in the c/d

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,349
deployment journey I can the journey of

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,280
adopting this stuff and what role does

00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:02,669
spinnaker playing in that infrastructure

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,400
so yeah that company we've been in

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,490
production with spinnaker now for just

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,389
every year and its really helping us

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,099
Margaret

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:16,770
more towards CD from 7ci in that CI you

00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:19,190
have like manual intervention steps

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,680
before guys to production with CD is

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,139
continuous delivery without the human in

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,750
as my understanding than anyone so

00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,900
speaker is surly encouraging us to move

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:36,360
more towards seating and helping with

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:40,390
that I would say that we have seen

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,240
probably 14 or 15 pipelines going

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,640
through that actually a truce continuous

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,800
delivery and that being resolved with us

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:53,620
adopting spinnaker I'll probably say

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,330
that it's been within the last six

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,500
months okay there with those ones but

00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,010
there is a whole bunch of other stuff

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:05,320
let's see I see how as a place as well

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:07,360
thank you yeah it's an ethics may have

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,970
been doing confuse deployment for quite

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,630
many years starting with 3G networks

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:16,150
about traditional telecom networks

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:20,350
without using like purpose-built

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:22,000
Hardware modeling software and even

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,860
though we've been doing continues plamen

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,660
time with all this cloud versus asian

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,440
cloud native transformation going on

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,170
across telecom industry the telecom

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,840
applications are getting containerized

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,450
and pushed into cloud type of

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,870
infrastructure and you know we have been

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:43,330
doing continues deployment the new

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:45,540
technologies and new concepts require us

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,370
to approach the continuous deployment

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,490
way of doing things in different way

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,830
based on the new technologies and if you

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,050
I'm new in spinnaker a few months ago I

00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,820
started working speaker what in terms of

00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,290
Ericsson we have been using spinnaker

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,170
for orchestrating application

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,120
development internally and we haven't

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,490
started working to using spherical for

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,030
pushing start production because daikon

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,870
networks are kind of

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,750
compared to I T type of work laws but we

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:19,910
are on a journey I'm sure we'll get the

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:23,330
most other speakers hopefully soon yeah

00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,260
so I think the my perspective is

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,210
probably going to be a bit different

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,580
from those on the on the rest of the

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,650
panel I've gotten to see kind of the

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,390
adoption of spinnaker from both sides so

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,100
before armoury I was at a company called

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,560
squid where I drove adoption of

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,450
spinnaker as a software delivery

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,970
platform so we were two point in

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,650
kubernetes so it's a very similar

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,470
experience to probably everyone here

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,650
where they're rolling out spinnaker

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:50,570
internally but then I joined armory and

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,420
not only do I get to I get to use

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,640
spinnaker and work on spinnaker but we

00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,380
actually get to help people adopt

00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,030
spinnaker within their organisations too

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,760
so we're working with companies at a lot

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,590
of different levels of adoption so we

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,080
have customers who come to us who have

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,490
already used open-source spinnaker and

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,650
they're looking to use some of the

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,990
features that we layer on top we have

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,820
people who are just coming into learning

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,640
kubernetes and spinnaker at the same

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,610
time so it's really like we get a lot of

00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:23,410
experience and we see kind of the

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:28,100
different challenges I think that people

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:30,410
have and so by getting to work by

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,010
bringing in kind of personal experience

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,090
from driving adoption but also seeing

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,030
customers also try to face those

00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,920
challenges I think we're just kind of

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,110
helping build a better platform to make

00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,790
that easier for everyone here and

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,790
everyone who's who's joined us

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:55,710
hey so at Capital One their love or big

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:58,920
lines of businesses like God or bank or

00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:02,040
dick so I work for their tech division

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,380
called the shell tech and my team is

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,040
basically responsible for taking

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:12,150
spinnaker from open source and extending

00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:15,720
it adding integration with our services

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:20,010
that our team offers on that platform

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,690
and there a lot of different that they

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,210
both teams as well are in different

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,660
lines of businesses they may be using

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:31,080
Jenkins or something else

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:34,140
so what my journey has been for pastor

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:38,220
one year or so has been like trying to

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:43,020
bring this pinnacle development into a

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,120
capital one and like showcase how it's a

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:51,209
better tool than a simple Jenkins

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:54,360
pipeline and basically showcase the

00:09:51,209 --> 00:10:00,720
talent or the features that it offers in

00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,490
the HDD space so JP Morgan Chase I mean

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,080
Jenkins has been our continuous

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,690
integration engine for a while we've

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,580
extended it to do deployment what got us

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,320
down the road and so we've been doing

00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,850
continuous deployment for a while we've

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,100
actually invested and built out a

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,170
homegrown deployment engine that's agent

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,360
based so a lot of the orchestration

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,670
those been done by run deck and also

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,830
done by Jenkins I think what got us down

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,690
the road of thinking about a better

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,540
alternative was the fact that these

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,220
things called cloud platforms came into

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,680
the bean right we weren't all about bare

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,920
metal and virtualization so the

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,150
spinnaker we were the white paper myself

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
and a colleague with a white paper that

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,400
said what are we doing today so what are

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,510
the CICE tools that we use and off the

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,440
back of that we said what's their

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,210
capabilities and what's the capabilities

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,190
we need so we weren't so focused on

00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,900
tooling but we do feel that spinnaker

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,940
could be a really nice match to some of

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,850
the things that we weren't doing so well

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,590
especially for cloud platforms cool

00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,080
thank you so I think that a couple of

00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:07,510
you guys hit the next question that we

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:11,230
planned on so then you kind of talked

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:13,180
about moving away from CI although you

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,960
say there CI has a role you know we've

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,960
talked about CI

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:22,660
part of the whole ecosystem of your

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:26,910
DevOps tooling you know the question is

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:31,089
sort of which comes first is it CI CD

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:33,850
doesn't doesn't matter like how do we as

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:37,569
organizations and why would we kind of

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,519
do one before the other how them how

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:42,399
should that affect how we adopt these

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,839
kinds of tools so let's start I think

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:53,139
we'll start with even I think in this

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:54,249
one that's fair yeah so which one comes

00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,119
first I think that's an interesting

00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:57,550
question

00:11:55,119 --> 00:12:00,160
because obviously if you don't have

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,279
anything to deploy then you can't really

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,949
employ right so if you if you don't take

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,749
care of CD or CI or you don't have

00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:09,850
lollies and building an artifact to

00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:13,059
deploy then there's nothing to deploy

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,540
but I would also I also think that CI is

00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:18,519
actually the easiest part think about

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,220
actually integrating code and building

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,819
code and running tests it may be just

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,509
unit tests that's been easier but tools

00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:31,149
like spinnaker help solve the complex

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,910
issue that is CD or just software

00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,980
delivery in general because you know we

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,809
all you know when you're when you start

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,370
doing kind of like immutable deployments

00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,110
you're actually just taking a single

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,209
artifact and promoting it across

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,470
environments and so the fact that we

00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,149
have a bunch of different environments

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,999
with a bunch of different or perhaps

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:54,129
requirements that's where the complexity

00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:56,579
comes in so even though CI and testing

00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:59,679
kind of naturally comes first I think

00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:01,149
the the part of the problem that needs

00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,939
kind of the most attention and the most

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,429
understanding is delivery so you might

00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:08,030
argue that that might come first in your

00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:10,220
thinking but maybe not implemented

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,570
that makes a lot of sense of fatiah

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,920
thinking you have something to say here

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,470
tell me here with your sake we won't see

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:21,190
anything yeah ocular about kind of a

00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:21,190
gray area between between the blasting

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:31,910
my response to this question will be

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,370
non-technical because a continuous

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,780
integration countries with all if we go

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:41,330
back more a child way of working it's

00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:44,540
more social than technical so if workers

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:47,390
are not working or if they're not in a

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,250
habit of pushing to master branch or

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,670
integrating their changes to master

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,750
frequently which is the technician of CI

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,550
you can take contains the jewelry

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,920
because in order for you to be able to

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,830
some artifacts and push them to your pub

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,840
and pipelines and reached production in

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,660
them you need to have some port coming

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,680
into your repository so that's why I

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,690
feel like without CI rests is nearly

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,260
impossible because you don't open

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:17,180
anything and when we generally getting

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,070
to this type of conversations we end up

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,860
in talking about tools generally and

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:24,620
that is one of the crucial things in CI

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:27,010
CD and the ops domain is that we should

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,370
normally forget about human aspects of

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:33,890
this journey and the spinnaker okay it's

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,690
great to its it orchestrates the prongs

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,010
tools and so on and enables you to

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,740
achieve conscience to the way and

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,200
deployment but one of the good things

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,850
about spinnaker is that it demonstrates

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,120
concepts and principles and practice of

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:49,040
continues to derail while doing that one

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,070
must not forget about what instigation

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,650
as well and that in my opinion should go

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,480
first to get person having to push code

00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,960
frequently rather than staying on branch

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,960
for weeks

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,920
like Tibet so maybe you can elaborate a

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,370
little bit on what you meant by moving

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,140
to see from Zi yeah absolutely so yeah

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,720
when I said we hoped affording things

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,580
roughly on the CD that was a very small

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,060
fraction of first things that we

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,130
actually cannot speak up so we've

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,740
certainly taken the approach of solving

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:25,190
the Cy part of it and getting the

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,650
frequent commits as you're talking about

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:31,050
into building an artifact that then goes

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,910
on to an image and it goes on for some

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,880
testing and then we have like a manual

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,040
step and that's what I'm defining is is

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,750
that's a difference between that's the C

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,750
eyes over there and now someone has to

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:47,160
go make a decision and certainly the CD

00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:49,920
part is super complex and I completely

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,770
agree with Ethan that part isn't that

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,710
getting that to be robust using things

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:57,630
like canary and and other tools to do

00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,580
that judgment that human normally would

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,860
do and doing a way that you have

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,840
confidence and know that it's going to

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,880
be right every time or roll back every

00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,360
time and that's super hard and I think

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,940
spinning has got a lot to offer there so

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,100
that hopefully that clarifies I think it

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,440
where I'm coming from but times are your

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,910
original question I think the first

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,840
thing the software engineer has to solve

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:24,480
is the C light and get that to you

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:28,860
committing frequently you get it to a

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,230
pipeline that is CI just being practical

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,820
here with a manual judgment step and

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,180
tool that you've signed off on all the

00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,180
CD

00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:43,920
Richard do you have anything to have I

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,050
think spinnaker has spinnaker as an

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,540
opinion right spinnaker says I'll listen

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,970
to Jenkins this vinegar has this Jenkins

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,529
stage right so I think in some ways you

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,519
think about the uber Orchestrator what

00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:56,579
orchestrates what

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,439
but for CI in terms of you know

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,060
continuous change you have to have

00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:02,189
architecture that supports it right

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,750
there's a native architecture of micro

00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,069
services where your apps are so there's

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,319
a lot of complexity to even make that

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,760
work but when I think of spinnaker it's

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,380
almost got an opinion about itself

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,309
saying hey I'll be Hooper Orchestrator

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,209
I'll call Jenkins and different

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:16,589
perspective but I think there's

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,280
boundaries around these tools right

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:22,530
which tool makes what capability a

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,500
first-class citizen think about testing

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,480
right unit testing versus Cayenne take

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,100
the spinnaker Duke ante well would you

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,860
go into Jenkins and try to script

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,659
yourselves into a test methodology

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,490
instead of test and pulling metrics and

00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:37,049
make those decisions with Jenkins it

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,140
doesn't do that really well so I think

00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:41,909
the differentiation is spinnaker is it

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,890
does things very well but then Jenkins

00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:46,470
natively does other capabilities very

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:56,610
well so it's a clean separation in many

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:59,880
cases yes sir so at Capital One we also

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:03,000
follow similar process where spinnaker

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,059
acts as a master orchestrated so code

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,429
commits the triggers my pipeline and

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:11,669
spinnaker and we basically then together

00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:14,340
CH system on Jenkins which creates the

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:15,720
artifact and then artifact is like push

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,100
through different stages in the pipeline

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,049
from dev

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:24,330
staging to prod and within all these are

00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:26,970
like publishing of the artifact that we

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,909
have to go and validate several things

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,130
like whether functional testings are God

00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:34,650
or puffin testing results are good so

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,520
all those things are like not built into

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,360
spinnaker

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,659
yet so what at Caplin we are trying to

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,630
do is a create some custom stages and

00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:48,350
trying to bring that interesting

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,920
do well and pipeline and try to like

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,090
force this change on 12 necessary

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,300
spinnaker doesn't really does act as the

00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,290
orchestrator of those other things

00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,270
that's really interesting that actually

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,350
I don't know if any other people's heads

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,560
are going there I have a little bit of

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:06,140
an empathy background and it makes me

00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,570
want to ask putty because there's

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,010
there's a big debate within a fear about

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,950
sort of who is the orchestrator of

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:17,120
orchestrators and everybody wants to

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,800
orchestrate everybody else and we've all

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,740
been in this industry long enough to see

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:26,030
the you know many iterations of the

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,680
master scheduler there's a little bit of

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:31,010
that notion coming along here we start

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,410
out making it so that spinner can can do

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,260
anything it's been a car the right place

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:40,880
to become say the orchestrator virtual

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,830
network doctor but if you asked asked

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,650
this question to other telecom people

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,750
they might answer on an open network

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:50,380
automation platform which is an

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:53,150
Orchestrator management and organization

00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,820
prove open source projects to deal with

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:59,090
EMF person at work functions onboarding

00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:03,080
now the thing is like skin Korea s great

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:05,900
for restoration things but we must maybe

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,690
5 10 years we have this transformation

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,510
going on in telecom industry and IT

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,220
industry is also doing course of that

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:18,230
might will be used for tech ominous but

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,140
we need these industries like telecom in

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:23,049
traditional telecom and I

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,299
I used to come together to find a common

00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:27,760
way forward because if you will get a

00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:31,269
luminosity they come up with their own

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,179
solutions and I T do the similar things

00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:35,710
and their product quite many overlaps

00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,179
between all these orchestration

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,740
challenges and management challenges

00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:42,580
because in the end version network

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,710
functions or continuous or cloud native

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,799
network functions their applications as

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:50,080
well and that's what's good about

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,899
pushing applications to cloud

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,639
infrastructure and I can say if

00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:59,200
spinnaker can be that one but I think

00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:00,159
most of opportunities to collaborate

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,200
further

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:08,799
it means industries to find better ways

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,889
of doing things so that's I can't be

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,480
political but I'm trying my best people

00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:15,010
because I am come from telecom and I am

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,779
working in the foundation networking

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:20,350
projects is open source program there is

00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:22,630
a lot of interesting orchestration and

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,990
spinnaker is something we are working on

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,370
our project of network function

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,110
informative functions virtualization and

00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,850
that's one of the reasons why we are

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,039
working to spinnaker to orchestrate

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,190
these things that's really good to hear

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,440
because I this industry we've seen you

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,659
know anyone of you see that armory but

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,639
in other companies we've always seen the

00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:43,990
challenge of selling the telecoms versus

00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:46,029
knowing everybody else is completely

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,510
different and you're solving exactly the

00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:51,309
same problem so stop inventing new ways

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,990
of doing things we've all come together

00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,639
there are different requirements in

00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,190
different places and so that leads to

00:21:54,639 --> 00:22:01,040
being kind of to the next question is

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,440
you know where the spinnaker help you

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,500
in which current application

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,570
environments have you seen it'd be the

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,330
place to start where do you find the

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,710
kinds of applications that in your in

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,980
your organization's you're gonna find

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:18,710
the quick wins and start building

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,720
adoption by doing a quick win and then

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,670
growing from there is that a valid

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,360
strategy or is there another way that we

00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:30,710
should approach it I guess I still have

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,590
answers to the old question but you're

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,150
the moderator now one thing I was

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,530
thinking about is rolls kind of drive

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,740
the way you use a product because we've

00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,210
got rolls that really don't care how

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,500
artifacts come to being right so you

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,030
think about a devops role that's

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,130
handling the operations a deploy a

00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,420
product you got a docker image it shows

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,100
up there thinking about that docker

00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,840
image and how it gets best deployed so I

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,000
think roles you know you may not even

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,770
know there's a Jenkins out there I think

00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,940
this conference were very technical so

00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,440
we know this Jenkins thing and the

00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,480
spinnaker thing but I think there's

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,100
other roles release managers it may not

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,600
even know this thing that's called

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:09,220
Jenkins right they're very focused on

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,220
spinnaker another question was was was

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,400
okay so for us right we've got this

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,440
pickle cloud foundry platform internally

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,300
right and we can do a much better job at

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,430
mortis treated unemployment of those

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,380
applications so today we use Jenkins

00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,850
that that does some things for that

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,260
platform and we've worked with our

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,510
partners at pivotal that have done a

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,280
nice job to extend the capability and

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,230
spinnaker does some nice things that

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,450
we'd have to script up and blue grain

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,850
for instance we've got it scripted but

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,860
it's just it's fragile right so it gets

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,380
back to that point of first-class

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,970
citizen and how it treats the deployment

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,950
strategies and spinnaker does really

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,590
well better versus again we scripted it

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,150
breaks and Jenkins and then having

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,010
something like pivotal and a cloud

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,770
driver that does something in a repeated

00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,520
way in a

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:59,520
whey is also a value-add and so and also

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,140
one pipeline that does everything for a

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,970
developer maybe I'm stretching there's a

00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,770
lot of friction in a process today where

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,870
you'll push the application but their

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,110
services you have to create a Marina DB

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:12,120
of my sequel database and you want to be

00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,010
able to have a seamless deployment

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,750
experience where you deploy that you

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:18,930
deploy the service you can find the app

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,210
and then you can also roll back so so

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,470
you kind of hit on something interesting

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,200
here because you're kind of saying use

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,900
the right tool for the right job

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,060
given the skillset and capabilities of

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,820
the platform that you're using not

00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,430
necessarily there's not necessarily a

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,220
white line essentially between the CI of

00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:40,770
the CD in that sentence inflatable does

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:46,650
a lot more things in with CD sense on

00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:49,020
its own kubernetes and draft those

00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,970
similar things and foundry those would

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,320
build packs for the platform but I don't

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,550
think we all had this figured out that's

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,110
what's so great about this conference

00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,700
and here's some of the answers and I see

00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,020
the eyes and everybody's going well they

00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,910
don't really understand what's going on

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,100
because I know that yes sir right this

00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:07,230
is complex stuff this whole CD space is

00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:11,700
so new to us Ethan yeah I mean so the

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:13,800
whole concept of what Orchestrator is

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,350
responsible for doing what is really

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,930
interesting to me because to Richard to

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,490
your point it really you know it comes

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:24,480
down to the best hope for the best job

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:26,910
right so we I think the reason that like

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,960
this is probably a really simplified way

00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,050
to put this but the reason that

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,510
kubernetes exists is because we we tried

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,250
to do kind of like maybe we tried to do

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,080
the Jenkins way of like scheduling stuff

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,870
on a node right we found out that we

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,610
actually need a platform that is smarter

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,620
for that but then we have kind of

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,820
invented this new problem where we now

00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,080
need a way to interact with that

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,520
platform and so kind of I think one of

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,460
the reasons that I think that spinnaker

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,710
or something like it may be the position

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,620
or maybe the best place to kind of do

00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,910
all this orchestration it's because

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,030
there's a lot of there's a lot of

00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,650
information coming from

00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,840
both sides of the line there so

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,580
spinnaker kind of sits in this really

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,630
unique position where we're getting a

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:12,340
lot of kind of feedback or we get a lot

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,290
of inputs coming from CI and from the

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,880
development process but then we got a

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,090
lot of exhaust coming out of the

00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,500
production kind of production running

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:23,620
and a lot of metrics coming out of

00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,540
production and stuff and so since

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,430
spinnaker is handling a lot of the

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,410
exercises around deployment all around

00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,660
delivering software I think it makes

00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:35,230
sense to kind of perform a lot of

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,910
orchestrations there so you know part of

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,710
your like integration testing and stuff

00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,290
actually involves the point so it

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,880
doesn't it make sense that the toy are

00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,470
doing deployments even if it's not

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,410
executing integration tests it's

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:52,960
triggering them and that's part of where

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:56,500
that orchestration happens so why

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,090
wouldn't you do that with say so I don't

00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,860
think that that Jenkins is not the

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:04,000
answer for that to be totally honest

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,710
like I think spinnaker is the tool to to

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,720
get it out there but then you need

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,640
something that runs tests Jenkins is

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,580
really great at running tests and you

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,210
know executing arbitrary code like RC is

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,770
a service but but yeah so just having

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,100
the ability to trigger those things from

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,900
spinning I think makes a lot of sense so

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,950
at Capital Minh we follow a process

00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:30,310
called a pre approved releases and

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:33,040
during that release or recycle let's say

00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,840
we are trigger a test on Jenkins and we

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,180
collect all the test results so those

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,430
decisions are we try to publish back to

00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,080
the pipeline and then pipeline basically

00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:43,890
stores all the evidences that are

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:49,090
required for a successful deployment and

00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:51,160
our capital burn the sender's are even

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,900
sector so we have to go through some

00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,180
kind of approval process before we

00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,910
deploy to production so the pipeline

00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,100
basically pushes all the evidences to

00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:03,430
the correct approval process system and

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,750
then people can look at ok this is one

00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,640
artifact that was created by the

00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,759
pipeline and that is going through all

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,859
the phases in the pipe

00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,080
it is the direct artifact that's been

00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:15,720
tested and testicles have been collected

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,479
so then a spinnaker becomes like a

00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,409
bigger ecosystem that only a application

00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:24,409
deploy so you in your world spinnaker

00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:38,639
becomes the orchestrator of approvers

00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:45,840
validators have a slightly different

00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:47,450
perspective but i agree with as well so

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,039
in modern online

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,809
spinnaker interacts with all the tools

00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,249
that you want to interact with and if

00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:55,590
there's one that's not supported today

00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:58,649
you know the community is pretty fibrin

00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,330
you can reach out perhaps collect the

00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:03,239
team of people to write that integration

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:06,269
I think the real strength of spinnaker

00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:08,820
is the ability to put a pipeline in

00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:10,590
front of a software engineer that looks

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,679
the same whether it's to point the

00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:15,749
Amazon or Cuban Eady's and then your

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,309
tools that you use underneath the colors

00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:19,019
whether it be Jenkins or some other

00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:21,269
Unger tool that you want to stitch into

00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:23,519
the pipeline the pipeline's tend to look

00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:25,619
the same and so now in storage meters I

00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,649
made between teams there's a familiarity

00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:30,629
in the build process and you started to

00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:32,820
build that confidence and that speed and

00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:35,009
then the time to market starts to

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,960
increase I'm not sure how many people

00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:40,210
here are using spinnaker

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,429
Oh silly noticed with a my own

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,409
organization and the organizations are

00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,360
spoken to that are using it at the time

00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:48,970
to market cut seam to the cadence seems

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,320
to pick up once you get a similar very

00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,659
good - actually that's a reason some

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,899
interesting question how many folks here

00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:58,929
are playing with spinnaker at least can

00:29:55,899 --> 00:30:07,440
you raise your hands okay how many of

00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:07,440
you are using it as a way okay your

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,679
production

00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:44,190
sorry I think you can leave that icon I

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,100
don't think of the feedback you know who

00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:49,530
who is using spinnaker in production

00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,640
today and has been doing so for what

00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:54,420
they consider a reasonable amount of

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,730
time and has found that the engineering

00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:04,260
process talk to production has sped up

00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:07,560
as a result good results I I had a very

00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,720
similar experience to that when I first

00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:13,560
started using Spinnaker's was during the

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,360
the days of the v1 provider I was

00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,100
personally getting kind of onboard of

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,420
the kubernetes but I also had the task

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,390
of onboarding the rest of our

00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,620
application teams and so one of the I

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,360
think the phrase that I like to use the

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,890
most is it held me deploy more

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,540
meaningful software because I didn't

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,250
have to think about how to deploy it

00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,320
I could actually focus on writing my

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,690
application because deploying soft but

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,040
deploying with spinnaker was the same no

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,110
matter what application that was the

00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,490
point so that's back to Richard's point

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,020
is that there are different stakeholders

00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,340
in the process who have different points

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,650
of view it's better if air allows you to

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,870
do more separation with concerns

00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,740
essentially right yeah yeah

00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:52,070
Freitas project did you have a leaning

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,070
forward

00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:00,390
so we have like concept called

00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:03,620
separation of duties so we try to follow

00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:07,590
that with our pipelines and a pipeline

00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:08,850
committer is not a preferred and someone

00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,580
needs to approve that pipeline before

00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:14,220
you can push code through that pipeline

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,350
so do you know do you find that that

00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,090
actually speeds things up or is it just

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,090
a policy that you have to have a human

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:26,070
you need to have a human process in all

00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,960
in the pipeline we try to like automate

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:37,800
a lot of things but sell there has to be

00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:40,710
some kind of human interaction and the

00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,950
biggest victory in last few weeks has

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:46,020
been like getting applications on board

00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,720
it took this pre-approved pipelines

00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,390
which are like a based on the managed

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,550
Python templates so if applications are

00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:56,640
using those managed and placed then they

00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:59,310
get like a easy onboarding and EPA

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,650
approval process like rather than going

00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,290
to some instrument criteria for

00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:08,160
validating there follows all the

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:10,980
processes the pipeline is basically

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,140
doing the process work for you so you

00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,640
don't have to do that on your own

00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:20,190
so that's a big win for us I think that

00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,960
means everybody has more to add on this

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,400
subject

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,060
transitions on the next question which

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,560
is how do you go about in different

00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,389
kinds of organizations implementing

00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,749
spinnaker in the right way

00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:41,529
correctly what does it mean to sort of

00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:43,959
get the most out of this Richard wants

00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:46,869
to judge okay you just hired from the

00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:48,940
developers really in the bank you know

00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:50,440
we really are doing that we're getting

00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,209
fairly opinionated out of the game

00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,369
because it's so powerful that were you

00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:56,019
know regulation heavy right so out of

00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:57,999
the gate we're gonna have very simple

00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:00,849
pipelines that are opinionated and

00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:02,229
defined at what they do right a matter

00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:03,940
of fact that talked a little bit about

00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:07,539
the fact that we have a deployment

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,429
product that's fairly it's reliable

00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:11,409
scalable two hundred thousand endpoints

00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,539
that will be the product that actually

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:15,970
says vinegar to go do what you do well

00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:18,010
initially and to at least the real power

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,579
we've got a lot of work to do so out of

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,510
the gate

00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:23,200
it'll be empowered by spinnaker just

00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,529
like armory

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,629
is powered by spinnaker right even so

00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:30,970
yeah so at first very opinionated simple

00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:32,710
pipelines you know I think about the

00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:35,440
level of abstraction we've thought about

00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,839
this do we have a chat bot that says

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,000
deploy application I heard in the

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,649
earlier talk it was Andrew Phillips who

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,839
can get very complex but he said look

00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:45,429
you know what the developers really need

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,409
to define as part of their deployment

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,059
and that was talking to t-mobile and

00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:51,009
they said look there's this image that

00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:53,230
needs to be deployed you might have a

00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:54,970
deployment strategy so what are the

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,470
smallest ingredients that the developer

00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,210
could provide where you could deploy to

00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,980
any platform whether it's kubernetes or

00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,420
cloud foundry internally and their ever

00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,220
reasons that you're able to do that

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,640
we're on performance resiliency and some

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,640
other things

00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:17,479
and the thing is like that is most

00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:20,279
obviously single way to deploy to

00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:22,499
correct for all the organizations but

00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:25,319
again if I look from developers

00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:28,079
perspective since I'm an opera like

00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:30,479
developer I don't really like to jump

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,549
between different systems like I write

00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:34,890
my code and send it to get it or github

00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:37,199
or whatever we are using for code

00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,180
reviews and then some stuff started

00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,400
laying there like in tests recognizes

00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,739
and so on I look at those results for

00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,309
Jenkins for example and then it gets

00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:49,380
built into artifacts and some kind of

00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:51,809
smoke tasting care policies it happens

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,180
on a different system and all these

00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:56,279
stages are on different systems I have

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,099
to go through all these different places

00:35:56,279 --> 00:36:02,249
to find get feedback to see if what I

00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:05,489
just wanted some stuff for others and I

00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:08,729
think one of the important things at

00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:10,799
least for me when putting spinnaker in

00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:13,199
place is to take the feedback from the

00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:16,349
local community to help them out because

00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,839
like okay we have lots of testers or is

00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:20,729
magic and so on they can go and look at

00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:23,189
things and have routing so speaker which

00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:26,219
is fine but it's inter it's important to

00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:29,719
take feedback into account while

00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:35,369
bringing up spinnaker and blowing it for

00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:37,799
organizations because developers live

00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:40,230
their lives through entire pipeline by

00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:44,800
not just one committal

00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:47,140
they have to look at things at time tray

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,270
that is like what the hopes is no you

00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,920
are not supposed to do and what I forget

00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,560
about start by dumping or artifice

00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,500
ominous so it is one of the important

00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,730
aspects to enable others to do this so

00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,560
if I'm understanding what you say

00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,930
correctly you're saying that spinnaker

00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,520
makes very visible to the developer but

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,960
things that traditionally the operators

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,750
have to care about I think they're not

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,360
okay and that is one of the strengths

00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,490
yes and I think that should be taken to

00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:18,100
any shoes any business or it's a

00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:21,400
horribly first class priority anybody

00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:23,590
else have anything to add I certainly

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,000
agree so many things that regionally

00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,000
saying they were at the start and

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,870
particularly simple coming up with a

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,610
simple use case to start with like if

00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:36,490
you're a company that hasn't used this

00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:38,590
year and what I've found really

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,290
beneficial as I rolled it out because I

00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:43,180
was the guy that did it is I went and

00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:47,170
found out all the common paint paint

00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:49,510
cases and and found a pattern and solved

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:53,620
that in a simple pipeline template and

00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:55,810
then demonstrated that as the option

00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,160
well I didn't give them all the

00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,440
information about all the many many

00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,720
things you can do and then we started

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,190
cutting over applications onto the our

00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,410
pipelines and a lot of that but my still

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,610
very similar as a result and now we've

00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,130
gone to that point we've got some

00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,870
maturity and people have understanding

00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,790
having wilted the part of Mines and

00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,890
starting to really understand the power

00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,300
of it now we can start to think about

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,190
more complex things like pipelines

00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,570
running pipelines event multi-threaded

00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,060
pipelines and all sorts of things

00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:24,049
happening but that's that very simple

00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,569
use case to start with to get everyone

00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:28,759
on board and used to the tool and you

00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:36,949
know that muscle memory is really

00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:39,160
important not to be underestimated I I

00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:41,809
totally agree with with Richard and Ben

00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,249
what we've found is kind of the most

00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:44,779
successful of the one of the ways that

00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:48,259
we kind of have worked with customers

00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:51,079
and it passes we one we want to go in

00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:53,689
and you want to take a look at at what

00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,729
common patterns I think the majority of

00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:57,650
teams are going to be deploying their

00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:59,689
applications in the same way because I

00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,009
think at a certain point you know there

00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:02,509
are some applications that have with

00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:05,119
some special requirements but the

00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:07,099
majority of applications are going to

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,920
have very similar requirements and so if

00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:11,689
you can find that 90 percent case that

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,259
helps with onboarding and it also helps

00:39:11,689 --> 00:39:18,319
with just just with the whole concept

00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:21,319
making sense because I think a lot of

00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:22,579
times teams are brand new to this and I

00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:25,130
talked about this a little bit of my

00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:28,699
talk earlier but with kind of the rise

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:31,069
of DevOps we're seeing people who have

00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:34,069
not been introduced to more operational

00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:37,009
type work being expected to do that and

00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:39,619
so tools like spinnaker exists to make

00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:42,259
to give them the power and the ability

00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:45,789
to do those types of tasks without

00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:49,519
having to totally understand like

00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:51,619
instant sizes and deploying to a VM how

00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,630
does how does how do we bake an image

00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:55,130
right I think there are a handful of

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,670
people that really understand how that

00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,729
works

00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:02,179
but we expect the majority of people to

00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:04,219
be able to to produce those images so I

00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:06,619
think spinnaker provides that the right

00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:09,499
abstractions to make it to still be

00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:11,869
powerful and make you effective but it

00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:13,729
it keeps away a lot of the complexities

00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:16,270
that is I think infrastructure and

00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:19,990
operations in general

00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:24,700
so I'll add to what Ethan just said so

00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:27,370
as like at Capital One my team's

00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,490
responsibility is to basically onboard

00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:34,360
more applications onto our platform on

00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:37,660
spinnaker but at the same time like for

00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,750
a new users or a new line of business to

00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,640
move to a platform there's lot of

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:46,120
Education that needs to be done to them

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,190
to explain them how pipelines work right

00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,470
how you can create a freestyle pipeline

00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:53,380
or how you can use the template base

00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,690
pipeline and just to help them

00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:59,310
understand this different terminologies

00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:13,240
takes huge amount of effort to do that

00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:15,850
so how do you Italy like we have one

00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,060
team that manages spinnaker and we

00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:22,030
extend the code base to like integrate

00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:24,250
with other capital services and we have

00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:35,110
been deploying like 200 applications

00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:38,170
plus with spinnaker locally yes and it's

00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:40,390
a it's a challenge every day we have to

00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,950
keep taking a look at the github

00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:45,490
commerce that are happening on the

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:48,780
spinnaker repositories and how to absorb

00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:52,750
those changes into our corpus and how to

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:55,900
make them available to our users so it's

00:41:52,750 --> 00:42:00,580
a never-ending challenge but yeah we try

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:02,140
to keep upward and up recently we had a

00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,210
chance to onboard a different line of

00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,800
business to our platform and we are

00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,080
going through this process where we are

00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,680
educating them like how what spinnaker

00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:15,510
is how do you create different pipelines

00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,510
what advantages does it bring into

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:23,760
question thinking of asking which is you

00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:25,470
know all of our organizations are pretty

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,930
different like we have different kinds

00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:30,900
of sizes structures degrees of

00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:32,460
engineering expertise investments in

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,840
these kinds of open-source projects

00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,810
whether or not we can even contribute to

00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,090
open source projects so you know the the

00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:41,280
core of the purpose of this panel is

00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:44,670
actually to kind of open up a discussion

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,109
around the ecosystem and how it's been a

00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:49,380
course it's in the ecosystem and hire

00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:52,410
people who can contribute to it so I

00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,240
think the question I'd like us to get

00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,560
into is you know when you're stuck you

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,050
know when we're implementing these

00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:01,080
processes where do you go to get help

00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:03,180
like do you go internally externally do

00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,400
you look at the open source community

00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:09,090
you do look at a commercial vendor like

00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,820
Harry Ransom just walked in the door I

00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:14,670
couldn't who do you talk to when it when

00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:17,730
it comes to getting help when you're

00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:22,950
stuffing so it's certainly I send an

00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:24,869
email to our armory or even and Ethan

00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,940
says hey we have a slack channel right

00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:29,190
there's a spinnaker community and

00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,869
there's an artery no that's

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,339
it's about communications at the end of

00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:34,080
the day right and the responsive

00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:36,900
communications I think that's the value

00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,400
and so if you happen to choose a vendor

00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,380
to help in that process that may be

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,000
important to you and or you know the

00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,349
spinnaker communities grow and we saw it

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,390
at what five thousand on the side

00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:47,369
Channel so being a slack user no doubt

00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:49,349
being able to you know absorb the

00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:51,210
spinnaker i/o site getting your hands on

00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:52,710
it and getting dirty is really a great

00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,240
answer but you start getting dirty with

00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:57,480
spinnaker and you start learning it gets

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,070
dirty back with you right now gets back

00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,530
to the labs trying to get to with Rogers

00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:03,720
how do you justify that in time

00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:08,099
investment yourself

00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:10,920
I was just gonna kind of add to your

00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:13,530
point about the community so I've been

00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,790
in like really deeply involved and it's

00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:19,650
it's events like this that really help

00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,530
us grow and help us kind of get unstuck

00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:24,060
when we're stuck right so I'm actually

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:26,430
really interested to talk to you after

00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,960
this about some of the about some of the

00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,540
pipelines and stuff that you've built to

00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,700
do kind of the regulatory stuff and some

00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,410
of the approvals because the company I

00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,880
was out before was going through Sauk -

00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,290
and I was trying to answer a lot of

00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,630
those questions and build tooling around

00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,670
that but it's just like having the

00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:43,710
opportunity to be in this place with

00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,630
everyone who's here

00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:47,700
because like you said all of our organ

00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:50,280
is that all of our organizations are so

00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,930
different but I think we all have a lot

00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,109
of really common problems that we need

00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:56,970
to solve and one of the like Andy loves

00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,490
to say that you know we open-source

00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:02,250
spinnaker because the innovations that

00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:05,340
happen in everyone else's organization

00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:09,109
we all benefit from that and that's kind

00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,109
of the coolest thing to me

00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:16,500
there are many open source countries out

00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,440
there like OpenStack or CN CF forums

00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,570
foundation projects and since I've been

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,030
working with those from it is quite some

00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:26,520
time there's a lot of experience that

00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:30,510
and a lot of challenge was thought in

00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:32,310
his face and I hear exact same stories

00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,490
in its pinnacle community as well I

00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:36,650
believe

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:39,480
communities should look into

00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,400
collaborating and coming closer more in

00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,050
order to solve the problems and

00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,320
collaborating in rather than vinegar

00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:48,630
sauce this problem here and OpenStack

00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:51,420
solves another problem that I think it

00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:54,720
is important to keep the communication

00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,580
channels over and enable people to come

00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,470
and talk about the earth problems and

00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:03,780
many times people generally talk about

00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,910
success stories but I think it's pretty

00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,310
important to talk about failures in

00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,720
order to help others and this happens if

00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:12,480
there is a quadrant and Allah Almighty

00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,040
that all people are not afraid of

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,750
talking because they will know that they

00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,060
are not alone in this type of problems

00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,550
and that is the power of community to

00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,490
enable each other be friendly that

00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:26,369
people talk and try your best to help so

00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:30,960
I think Spinnaker's what I've seen in

00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:32,970
the morning as well coming really great

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,130
community is really important for any

00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:38,280
current users and cloud communities

00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:40,740
within ecosystem so in practical sense

00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,720
like English we have five channels for

00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,240
this community

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,190
they're also you know that's so you know

00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,690
how how can we scale this because we've

00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,970
kind of got the conference thing which

00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:54,150
could only scale to such a point and it

00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:57,589
happens once a year like OpenStack twice

00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:00,030
a year how do we make sure that that we

00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:02,060
we're participating can get unlocked

00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:04,319
quicker and learn from each other

00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:13,680
it's slack room in the answer it doesn't

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:17,460
that scale there can be groups yeah I

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,260
really think the answer to that is this

00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,300
community is gonna scale as community

00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:24,540
scales if everyone is willing to help

00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,859
someone else so go into a regional

00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,349
question about whether you go with

00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:30,839
there's a problem generally first I'm

00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:35,819
trying to have a look at configuration

00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:37,349
guys you know Google search I may get to

00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:40,050
the point where cutting that and their

00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:50,910
armory dog food like they just they sold

00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:54,089
a lot but jump in the smoke channel and

00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:55,980
just say look I'm having this problem if

00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:57,329
someone if you see someone else top in

00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,560
there I am having this problem and you

00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:01,260
look off but that problem so it's gonna

00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,970
wait for it outside kind of jump into it

00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,920
say hey yeah I'm seeing that problem too

00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:07,589
and it helps bubble the priority of that

00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:11,040
question up similarly I try and log in

00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:12,900
to slag maybe once a week or two if I

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,250
haven't been in today and have a look at

00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,720
the questions people are asking and if

00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,790
it's a question I know the answer to

00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,410
I'll try and answer it and I really

00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:21,210
think that's the solution is scale is

00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,339
rather than rather than allowing on a

00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:25,619
select few group of people that are

00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:27,930
super helpful and spend the entire day

00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,609
just answering questions if we all

00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,750
answer one or two questions here and

00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:34,050
there I think we're going to scale

00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:37,140
that's great I think participation is is

00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,700
critical so you may even like to your

00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,089
point you may not know the answer to the

00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,800
question but any little bit helps any

00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:45,930
anything that you can say that might

00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,880
help unblock somebody even if it's like

00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:50,430
I'm not crazy I'm seeing this to like

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,520
you know so you had totally agree with

00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:56,670
that yeah my experience has been the

00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,400
same if I face any problem I first I

00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:01,050
believe of myself get into the code get

00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,010
my hands dirty but if that does not work

00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,599
then

00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:08,460
slack channel is the thing I go to and

00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,380
sometimes I get a respond response

00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:15,150
immediately sometimes it just gets a

00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:17,160
loss in the trade of messages but yeah

00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:20,160
what is this wow I wonder how we scale

00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,470
yeah because these things do get lost as

00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,829
we get bigger the likelihood that your

00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:27,359
issue is gonna get lost get tired so

00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:30,650
helping other people by jumping on the

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,650
same things is one method

00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:35,349
I kind of want to switch this up a

00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:39,039
little bit we've been kind of talking to

00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:41,109
looks ourselves up here I'm curious if

00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,849
there are people not yet - we have an

00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:44,400
awesome panel here who have questions

00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:47,710
themselves that they would like to

00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,190
publicly responsibility we've got a

00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,190
question back there

00:49:54,210 --> 00:50:00,039
okay so I work for a company and we use

00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,369
vinegar we've had the whole Jenkins

00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:05,019
thing one of the things that every

00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:07,450
company I've ever worked for CD is not

00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:10,450
default it's usually just kind of like

00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:13,089
go over the script locally to employ

00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,380
this software so what what do you think

00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:15,940
CD will become the default that

00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,319
accompanies red code it's because I

00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,519
think test potential development is

00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:19,990
starting to make this fruit sense like

00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,529
this is the people this is how we're in

00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:22,990
software

00:50:20,529 --> 00:50:24,849
there's not really a default oh there's

00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:28,140
that we deploy a software so in case if

00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:28,140
it any of you have found something

00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:36,880
that's a when continuous deliver then

00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:38,740
what kind of be the default um I think

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,069
it's starting to become more common I

00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:46,029
think kind of right out of the gate a

00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:47,859
lot of newer companies and companies

00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:49,869
coming out with it with newer attackers

00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:51,609
are starting with there because it's I

00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:53,680
think it's more information is out there

00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:57,339
right like how to do it how to do it

00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:02,259
well the tooling is there but I but I

00:50:57,339 --> 00:51:05,380
I'm not necessarily sure that continuous

00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:07,989
like fully automated no humans involved

00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,099
will I mean it may become a thing

00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:11,619
eventually but I don't see that

00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:14,259
happening anytime soon but I think

00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:15,849
that's kind of some of the the value of

00:51:14,259 --> 00:51:18,730
spinnaker is that it's not just a

00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:21,160
continuous delivery platform once you

00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:23,170
kind of achieve efficient software

00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,720
delivery it's just changing the trigger

00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,400
right it's it's not a it's not a human

00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,920
triggering something but it's a it's a

00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,079
machine triggering it so that's to me

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,670
that's kind of the line of continuous

00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,859
delivery versus software delivery is

00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:37,859
kind of who's kicking that process of

00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:46,299
the crucial team suppose the ICD is to

00:51:41,739 --> 00:51:47,920
try and claims like what you just said

00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:49,450
oh it works on my machine I have this

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,880
script here I just

00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:54,910
descriptive works and then that called

00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,829
peace Lansing CI CD it doesn't so it's

00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:59,619
basically again I'm going back to what I

00:51:56,829 --> 00:52:02,680
mentioned at the beginning is what

00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:05,890
people need to come to that mindset to

00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:09,099
ensure this mad about that person's own

00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:12,280
thing that they contribute to something

00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:14,530
bigger than what they are doing and they

00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,470
need to insure whatever they do works

00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:21,010
for other server as the ICD is there to

00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:23,470
guarantee this and another aspect of the

00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:26,650
ICD is to make problems painfully

00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:28,990
obvious and if things start stopped

00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:31,900
working or things can't be automated

00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:34,810
then there's a problem there and that

00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:37,210
needs to be something to be done to fix

00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,890
that problem by for example taking those

00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:40,720
screws from that guy and making it

00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:43,300
available to the entire organization and

00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,720
pushing them on to see ICD my own to

00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:48,670
make that part of the ICD and okay the

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,490
question he was like how we can make

00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:54,550
want is to read default but again it has

00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:59,069
to start with the CI part and it should

00:52:54,550 --> 00:53:03,579
continue for CD but get people in same

00:52:59,069 --> 00:53:04,900
type of thinking you know think about

00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:06,819
the type of applications you're

00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,619
deploying as well right in your micro

00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:11,619
services cloud native and beautiful

00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:13,359
infrastructure many businesses have many

00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:15,460
other application types to point the

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,079
mainframe so I think the answer to that

00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,240
type of question is it's really about

00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:21,010
your application architectures and the

00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,720
number of applications in that level of

00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:25,660
complexity and that we talked a lot

00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,670
about you know the orchestrator and then

00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,349
we start talking about business process

00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:31,900
and release orchestration within the

00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:33,790
banks I think there's so there's a lot

00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,710
to consider in terms of just automating

00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:37,510
yourself into a platform and deploying

00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,950
applications I think we're all starting

00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,329
to find our way there you know this

00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,829
Jenkins thing's been out there Swiss

00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:43,990
Army knife but we've all known about it

00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:45,910
but we're starting to learn about how do

00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:48,069
I orchestrate my releases how do i model

00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,690
my releases how do i deploy a cloud and

00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:50,520
maybe

00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:52,680
platforms which we haven't had virtual

00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,240
servers and some AIX is a mainframe and

00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,710
they're starting to remodel parts of

00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,000
their application but not all of it and

00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,710
we'd love to give the continuous

00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,119
delivery experience to all those

00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,789
platforms because these apps aren't

00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,140
going to that's called morph into cloud

00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:07,819
native architecture right out of the

00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,819
gate but it's been a great really cool

00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:13,170
everyone sort of got me thinking about

00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:14,700
something quite important is that one

00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,740
thing that's pretty good he encourages

00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,380
you to do is to do medical appointments

00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:22,289
and so that means not changing

00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:24,750
production outside of the pipeline so

00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:26,760
spinning care itself like even if it's a

00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:29,520
co-op with a manual judgment step

00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:32,970
speakers should be doing the deployment

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:36,630
of production and that process in itself

00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:39,539
helps you then toward the CV path if you

00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:41,309
want to because that manual judgments

00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:43,740
that now you can make a decision as an

00:54:41,309 --> 00:54:46,940
engineering or do I want to solve what

00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:49,650
needs to be solved to take that step out

00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:51,420
that's also a security that's kind of

00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,099
improved yeah yeah put the stick there

00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,930
and then let's give the carrot of a way

00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:56,609
to solve it so absolutely I think that

00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:58,260
manual notification would be totally can

00:54:56,609 --> 00:55:00,180
be a slack message we have it as a slack

00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,430
message it pops up in engineering teams

00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:05,390
slacks camellias and I don't want to go

00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:08,130
forward but removing access for

00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:09,930
engineers to run a script or something

00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,819
to do something outside of that pipeline

00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:14,279
to the production server is something

00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:17,150
like I'd highly recommend to get the

00:55:14,279 --> 00:55:17,150
most out of spinning

00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:26,670
so at the capital one we follow you

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:29,939
build you own process so every team

00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:32,959
basically works to bring efficiency into

00:55:29,939 --> 00:55:38,400
it and they see other teams doing that

00:55:32,959 --> 00:55:40,759
so they follow that here to your

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,759
question

00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:57,190
when you've had to extend spinnaker for

00:55:53,980 --> 00:56:00,430
your respective companies as the

00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:02,170
existing UI works well what has been

00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:04,690
what's been good and what hasn't about

00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:12,430
like creating a new view to having

00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:15,220
functionality so yes we when we

00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:18,160
initially on-boarded to spinnaker I

00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:19,810
think maybe cam here he's mighty member

00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,400
he can answer this question very well

00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:23,500
because I've been with Capital One

00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:39,070
around one and half years but his

00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:41,740
journey started very well before that in

00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:46,630
our early adoption we found detail

00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:49,930
follow for the application yes

00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:52,360
configuration was lacking lacking in

00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:55,030
particular see what capital needed we

00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,120
need to capture information of the

00:56:55,030 --> 00:57:02,650
application for attributes that define

00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:06,400
is CI component in our m CI management

00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:09,630
storage and so by default we couldn't

00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,610
make use of the as is application

00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:13,380
they it was very limited they were only

00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:15,240
three views or three attributes

00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:18,060
available so we have to extend the Vita

00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:21,600
model and then stop on top of that on

00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:24,450
you I know to capture that data we also

00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:28,590
found the need to provide some level of

00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:31,470
access control to this to the pipeline

00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:33,390
view as well as who can execute who can

00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:36,030
click the button and we can see the

00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:40,050
details of the execution so we overlay

00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:42,690
certain kind of emissions into deck well

00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:45,210
on nailing with such kind of certain

00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:47,490
like control access so to turn this into

00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:50,370
the community discussion you guys did

00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:51,990
some things in spinnaker awesome

00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:55,380
structures vinegar makes that possible

00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:56,910
now did you have the alternative to go

00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,370
outside where there are other people who

00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:01,110
were looking at similar problems or and

00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:04,620
or are you contributing these things

00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:09,440
back to be forgot that at that juncture

00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:11,490
we didn't find a cure that had the same

00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:16,980
challenge though we were subjected to

00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:19,320
sure we also were if not the first in

00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:24,200
tech organizations it doesn't occur so

00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,200
we were pioneering that journey for

00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:35,260
flower findings were essentially brand

00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:38,050
new but now we are evolving and we see

00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:40,630
that sudden decision that we took two

00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:43,839
years ago were not the right ones so we

00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:47,440
want to go back and try to work on

00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:50,470
existing UI and extend that UI rather

00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,869
than build our own on top of it and at

00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:56,470
the same time back in services we want

00:58:52,869 --> 00:58:59,859
to add more extension models to that

00:58:56,470 --> 00:59:02,349
rather than changing those because it

00:58:59,859 --> 00:59:07,270
becomes a day-to-day Mort issue with

00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:09,579
upstream codebase and we also plan to

00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:11,230
like contribute back we just need to go

00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:14,020
through certain approval processes that

00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:21,040
happened one once approved yes we would

00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:22,960
be starting to contribute you start to

00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,380
get a little you start get a little

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,180
scared

00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:27,040
in terms of that model right because our

00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:28,660
company has like many companies got a

00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,190
lot of developers and a lot of bandwidth

00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,170
that you can do a lot of things to these

00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:33,550
engines right and then you've got to be

00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,990
careful that you don't more from in a

00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:37,089
way that you can't leverage I think this

00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:38,829
pretty basic conversation but you got to

00:59:37,089 --> 00:59:40,359
be very careful I think the UI though is

00:59:38,829 --> 00:59:42,280
the place you can extend it fairly well

00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:43,780
you know tags and things will be

00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,670
important in the platform for just

00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,680
generic pieces and then there may be

00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:50,200
some we'll call more general ways to

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,660
integrate attributes into the UI frame

00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:54,609
that can be improved but I also think a

00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,800
lot of times the fastest route to adding

00:59:54,609 --> 00:59:58,510
capability is do-it-yourself and how do

00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,490
you involve the community in that

00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:02,290
decision right how do you say hey I'd

01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:04,270
like to have this particular attribute

01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:06,520
we all want that attribute it comes from

01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:07,930
a Jenkins job can we show it it's not

01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,180
always that simple but it can be very

01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:11,859
tough when you get a lot of capability

01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:13,480
within your business units to do some

01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:16,450
things you hire a lot of staff and you

01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,139
start to be a spinnaker experts it's

01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:23,469
tempting to make

01:00:18,139 --> 01:00:25,880
yes don't do that

01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:28,219
great anybody else okay so I think we're

01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,959
running we're at the end of the part I

01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:32,060
really want to thank our panel that's

01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,580
all

01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:36,690
[Applause]

01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:36,690
