[Music]

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,139
a discipline puppy and we are here the

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,330
spinnaker summer in Seattle today we

00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,939
have it ascending lower who's the should

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,369
I call your father

00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:22,160
my team did the little hard work so what

00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:26,029
do you do at Netflix what is it that you

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,369
do here so I i'm the director of

00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:34,010
delivery engineering we are charged with

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:36,410
enabling Netflix's competitive advantage

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,829
of speed through continuous delivery so

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:44,030
we essentially own and operate spinnaker

00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:45,260
at Netflix and spinnaker is well known

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,969
as a you know continuous delivery

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:52,100
platform to AWS but Netflix has more

00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:54,199
than one environment so obviously we

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,159
leverage AWS but we also have our own

00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:02,120
container cloud called Titus and then we

00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,379
we also have probably the largest CDN or

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,350
second-largest let's say I think

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,360
actually YouTube is larger than this

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,530
which is called our open connect or

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,240
which is called open connect and so

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,430
spinnaker is also delivering firmware to

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,790
that so we do have a multi cloud

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,770
environment and Netflix and again that's

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,570
what my team does is listen to those

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,880
stakeholders understand their use cases

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:31,240
and ensure that they can develop or they

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:35,810
can deliver or affect code code delivery

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:39,920
rapid reliably safely securely excellent

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,840
and as during your keynote yesterday you

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,540
were saying that no it's like officially

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,570
summit yes you're in a hotel finally

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,280
yeah yeah so can you talk about the

00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,540
evolution of spinnaker in these three

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,740
years yeah well so yeah it really is a

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,930
special that we are here you know in in

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,630
Seattle at the motif having this

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,980
conference the evolution of spinnaker

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,020
over the last three years has it's been

00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,300
a rollercoaster ride it's been amazing I

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,490
you know people have asked me in

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,750
conference did you ever imagine you know

00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,540
we all be hanging out here and Seattle

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,790
and the answer's no not in my wildest

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,930
dreams we ultimately set out in the

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:25,700
beginning to replace Asgard which was

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,950
essentially a a glorified AWS console

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,110
that affected or allowed you to do

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,350
deployments and it was very clear that

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,960
Netflix needed a single or at least a

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,330
centrally managed continuous delivery

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,280
platform that was could serve the needs

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,980
across various engineering teams and

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,100
Netflix but also enabled plug ability so

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,380
that we could go beyond AWS and look at

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,800
our data are open connect appliances

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,940
look at something like Titus anyways so

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,500
we set out to build this flexible

00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:00,560
platform and through a kind of chance

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,190
discussion with some folks at Google who

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,990
at the time I believe we're looking to

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,270
forecast garden make it work on a Google

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,940
cloud platform and and somehow we were

00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,489
able to convince them and why don't you

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,410
you know join join us in building this

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,790
thing called spinnaker we want it to be

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,560
pluggable and if you did it on Asgard

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,290
you know we wouldn't and then in fact

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
let me take a step back the the lesson

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,209
learned from Asgard is that it was

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,060
forked by IBM IBM forked it twice once

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,630
for Star flare and then wants to to make

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,070
it work with docker and those Forks were

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,310
fascinating because they changed it in

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,959
subtle ways in particularly you know

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,220
making Asgard work with docker was

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,110
eye-opening because we at the time we

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,550
started Netflix is looking at you know

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,040
well what's this Container Store and

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,570
what we do with it and here's this you

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,850
know divergent fork that we can't

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,100
leverage because it's so much different

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,620
than the main line Asgard so that being

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,650
said we'd set out to build spinnaker to

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,989
be flexible chance encounter with Google

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,970
another encounter with a good folks at

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,490
pivotal and lowan

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,630
we had you know we validated this idea

00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,570
that if we build this continuous

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,250
delivery platform in cooperation with

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,130
other vendors we can come out with a

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,710
platform that is you know not just for

00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:18,709
Netflix but for others so it's been a

00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:22,190
fascinating journey you know Microsoft

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:26,780
came on board eventually Oracle came on

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:30,050
board folks at Cerner added DCOs support

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,880
Google expanded their support from just

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,370
you know the compute platform to

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,250
kubernetes App Engine I'm probably

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,730
missing someone in there so it's it's

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,750
it's been an amazing journey and then

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,270
culminating we're not culminating but at

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,110
least the journey continuing in the last

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:51,170
six months AWS is now participating in

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,180
the project they today announced they're

00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,300
gonna be up streaming some lamda support

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,910
they demoed Fargate support and then

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,020
they they have the ability for you to

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,640
spin up spinnaker on UK s so it it just

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,010
continues to get more and more exciting

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,020
right and then you see all those users

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,340
here of course do you interact with them

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,220
you know they don't have a come to

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,650
dinner so what kind of use cases or

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:22,010
trends do you are seeing which I miss

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:24,380
you yeah I think amazed is you know when

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,850
I think about multi cloud from a from a

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,350
Netflix standpoint you know we look at

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,480
multi cloud from the standpoint of

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,160
there's AWS and then there's Titus which

00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,990
runs on top of it at us and then there's

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,510
for example the our open connect

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,890
appliances or FCA's I've talked to a

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,300
number of companies that are looking or

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,980
not looking excuse me are leveraging

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:45,350
both GCP and Amazon and have data

00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,880
centers and then are putting kubernetes

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,800
in those data centers and then being

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,300
able to say okay now we have one single

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,460
platform that can affect delivery to

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,770
both our data centers or to our data

00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,150
centers and the cloud and I suspect

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,830
eventually they'll migrate away from the

00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,730
kids

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,620
and so this time last year the

00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,480
multi-cloud story was kind of limited

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,870
two ways you know they're there they're

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:12,220
the poster child for both using AWS and

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:15,490
GCP but at this conference I feel like

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,220
every big company I talk to is doing the

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,780
same thing so that's definitely been

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,910
amazing for me because a lot of the

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,640
questions I've had to where I fielded

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,200
throughout the year or ever since we

00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,600
built spinnaker really are released at

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,420
open sources who's doing multi cloud and

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,740
why and so none of the conversations I

00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,010
had at this conference

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,810
why are you doing multi cloud and I

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,270
think it boils down to just a risk

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,090
assessment people don't want to put all

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,430
their eggs in one basket and and that's

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,950
not surprising I think there's a lot of

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,750
complexity and doing multi cloud but

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,700
apparently it's not as complex as I

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,350
would imagine because again talk to

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:59,890
snapchat or snap makers of snapchat and

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,660
their multi-cloud akka Cerner so yeah a

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,490
number of big companies are doing multi

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,340
cloud and I think the spinnaker is

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,569
enabling them to do it easily so because

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,550
you know

00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:13,059
you are a unique position because you

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,490
have seen a spinnaker from Asgard days

00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:17,259
you know and you know it's both but now

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,999
suddenly you're seeing people you know

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:22,599
embracing in the opinion that news

00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:25,089
kisses you did not envision back then so

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,439
we have seen some open source projects

00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:29,589
that made the mistake I don't want to

00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:31,689
name them and then learn some lessons so

00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:34,209
how like kubernetes is a good example

00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:35,919
where they have very tight focus they're

00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,899
more about no we don't do this we don't

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,360
do this we don't do that so how do you

00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:42,849
plan to ensure or at this state do you

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,319
even care about it that we're users we

00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,999
take it yeah that's a great question and

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,039
in fact we struggle with it internally

00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,899
at Netflix you know how do we how do we

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,909
ensure that spinnaker doesn't become you

00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:58,930
know bloated or fall apart on itself or

00:07:54,909 --> 00:08:00,879
kitchen sink I haven't seen indications

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,529
from the community the open source

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,069
community that were headed in that

00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:06,639
direction

00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:08,649
most if all of the major innovations

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,499
that we've seen has been from the

00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:14,050
standpoint of what are we deploying to

00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:16,539
which makes a lot of sense and then new

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,849
stages and then taking advantage of

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:22,149
particular let's say features within a

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:26,499
cloud so to speak like Lambda support or

00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:28,240
Fargate so I at this point I'm not

00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:29,619
necessarily concerned that the open

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,759
source community could take spinnaker in

00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:33,339
a direction that doesn't make a lot of

00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,189
sense some of the things we've done in

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,419
Netflix that I'm not hearing the open

00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,589
source community to talk about and so

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,880
this is probably something we need to

00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:46,269
kind of debate a for example at Netflix

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,220
we're doing library delivery with

00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:50,860
vinegar so there are a number of teams

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,199
at Netflix that don't necessarily

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,340
produce a service but they produce

00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,980
basically a jar

00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,420
that then maybe you as a service owner

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,150
with that import you know for your

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,880
particular application so these are

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,700
shared jars utilities so to speak and

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,340
those teams leverage spinnaker to

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,780
deliver those libraries and test and

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,010
ensure that those libraries don't break

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:17,170
you know and user so to speak and I'm

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,940
not aware of other people within the

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,200
open-source community doing that yet

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,290
what's better so be interesting to see

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,030
kind of if people follow that model or

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,140
if they see it as it doesn't make a lot

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,270
of sense although it's hard for me not

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,650
to see how that does not make sense with

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,820
respect to continuous delivery I think

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,480
another thing that we've done in efflux

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,650
that not seeing yet talked about or at

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,470
least implemented in the open source

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:41,140
world is we affect data with spinnaker

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,520
instead of Netflix so we have this up we

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,620
have the service called fast properties

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,530
and you can think of it like feature

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,490
flags you know for example when season

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:53,200
three of stranger things comes out

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,060
someone will flip a bit and it'll light

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,400
up the globe with season three right and

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,230
they'll do that via you know changing

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:04,300
some property from you never false to

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:09,130
true is live and over the years and

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:11,560
Netflix we have seen that let's say

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,270
changing data is is is pretty dangerous

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,300
or it can be very dangerous especially

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,450
from a global standpoint for example I

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,270
may accidentally flip the bit from you

00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,540
know false to true for is season three

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,880
of live early and that could be a bad

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,560
thing especially if we were contracted

00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,240
and some you know contractual basis not

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,340
to let's say release this content until

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:40,600
this date and so with spinnaker you can

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:42,610
create a pipeline to ultimately roll out

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,470
a property in a staged manner and

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,490
validate it between each stage so a

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,700
typical rollout let's say of a

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:53,209
a global affecting property is to do go

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,649
to one region flip it to true or false

00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:56,899
whatever it may be or whatever the data

00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:59,330
is invalidate you hadn't really broken

00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,800
production and then do another region

00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,560
and then do another vision so that's all

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,029
done via spinnaker it makes a whole lot

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,070
of sense because it is again affecting

00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,770
delivery and a secure safe reliable

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,459
manner it's just in this case isn't a VM

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:15,770
or a docker container but it's just a

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:20,810
data doesn't mean you have seen the

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:22,940
season 3 already ha ha no no but the the

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:27,050
can you can you personally stream it to

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,730
Europe just for just make a little back

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,029
door is vinegar and flip the seats for

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:36,500
you no you know it's funny cuz the a

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:37,730
very large bank is using spinnaker and I

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,980
just happen to have a mortgage with that

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,450
Bank and so I keep kind of making these

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,910
same jokes is there something you guys

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,529
can do to help me out here if if you

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,990
know I put some sort of flag inside of

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:55,760
spinnaker doesn't mean I have to get all

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:58,630
seriousness no ok so although these

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,940
internal use cases that you or I have

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,850
how do you plan to bring it to the

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,980
community so they can also benefit so

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,510
some of the challenges we have at

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,950
Netflix and I recognize that other

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,690
companies have these same challenges is

00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,420
that the systems that we integrate with

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,220
that my team integrates with themselves

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,800
may not be open source so in the case of

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,390
a library management per se we're

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,300
integrating with another system that is

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,700
not open source and so it creates a

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,230
challenge for us to roll obviously that

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,890
solution out in the open source

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:34,010
community so it goes back to us ensuring

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,470
that spinnaker is a platform so that we

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:37,760
can effectively move fast at Netflix and

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,920
integrate with other systems and not

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,660
have are being covered by the fact that

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,740
like well because we're open source and

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,450
they're not open source we have to do

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,579
some you know wrangling in this case we

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,380
don't have to because we've done this a

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,089
number of times and so from the open

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,230
source standpoint I think showing that

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:51,930
visitors some of the innovations we're

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,460
doing enough

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,649
like integrating with our fast property

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,160
service integrating with our dependency

00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:02,100
manager dependency management service

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,220
other enterprises likely have similar

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,570
systems and they can kind of model how

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:12,899
we've done it and they don't necessarily

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:15,270
look in sourcing so the I think the

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:18,510
answer really is is is that from a

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:21,660
priority standpoint is ensuring that we

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:24,300
put resources into making spinnaker easy

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,430
to extend and then showing how to extend

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,890
it and so like I said even though we

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,110
can't necessarily service that we do

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,550
integrate with is open sources called

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,920
our case it's slightly different than

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,500
you know the internal Netflix past

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,600
properties but arguably someone could

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,040
take that and run with it in the open

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,480
source world the library management

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,130
service I'm talking about the dependency

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,110
management service it's not open source

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,820
but I think it's easy enough to kind of

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,850
look and see how we did it and someone

00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,440
could replicate it on something

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,200
interesting that I was just in the right

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,410
now was that open source is kind of

00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,360
created this amazing word where you know

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,430
all these internal earlier you would not

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,040
expect you know kubernetes and all those

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,750
things to come out and now suddenly you

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,220
have these amazing technologies that are

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,920
being developed at the companies like

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,050
Netflix and you're open sourcing it and

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,800
everybody can benefit from it yeah yeah

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,360
isn't that awesome

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,250
yeah it is it's amazing but at the same

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,750
time what does Netflix get in return

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:23,370
yeah yeah I'm glad you asked it's it's

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,350
been asked a number of times

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,940
Netflix and are any company the open

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,350
source gets a lot of things but I would

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,140
say the number one benefit that we see

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:35,910
in efflux of innovation so a great

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:37,200
example is that Google they are in the

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,020
spinner ecosystem there's a team at

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,720
Google adding like amazing features to

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,100
spinnaker for you know meeting their use

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,439
cases and one of the use cases they had

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,179
when they needed a authorization and

00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:51,549
authentication service in spinnaker

00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:54,579
because when we built spinnaker at

00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:56,589
Netflix we essentially had it wide open

00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:58,749
because Netflix has a very open culture

00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,100
of freedom responsibility so you and I

00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:01,299
can go into spinnaker and we can do

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,149
whatever we need to do to get our job

00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:05,980
done including you know deleting someone

00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:07,619
else's service not that anyone in applix

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,199
would do that but you have the power

00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:12,939
yeah the notion is everyone in Netflix

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,299
has route to any machine in the cloud

00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:19,119
which is just true today however it

00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:21,389
turns out that not all companies embrace

00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:23,739
that in fact a lot of companies have

00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:25,779
let's say environments or restrictions

00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:28,239
on you know I can't touch this other

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,949
service whether it be for PCI or Sox

00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:32,859
compliance which in fact Netflix has the

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:36,100
same restrictions and so Google added

00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:38,019
this service called Fiat which adds off

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,329
an all to Z service on top of Spindler

00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:42,399
and within spittin I should say and now

00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:45,730
at Netflix were leveraging that and so

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,459
previous to us bringing in Fiat we have

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,929
to run two separate Spinnaker's one for

00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,519
all the employees and Netflix to do

00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:54,040
whatever they need to do with an AWS and

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,230
Titus and whatnot we had to run we have

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,259
to run a separate spinnaker that works

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,519
in our PCI compliant environment which

00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,410
we had locked down through a different

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,369
means and for example I can't get to

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,899
that because I shouldn't you know I

00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:07,660
shouldn't be affecting delivery in this

00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:10,089
environment which is fine but with Fiat

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,910
we are now able to not have to run to

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:15,339
Spinnaker's but one and that off an

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:18,040
Aussie framer will still ensure that I

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:20,350
can't go and do something in a PC I

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,509
scoped application but I still think

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,459
touch otherwise that's one big example

00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:27,789
of again innovation that someone else

00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:30,519
wrote that Netflix didn't have - a much

00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:34,389
simpler use case is there's a web book

00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,939
stage it's vinegar that was that was up

00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:39,579
streamed from shipstead which is a

00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:42,009
European company and I would say you

00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:43,959
know some high percentage of pipelines

00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:46,439
within netflix leverage the web hook

00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,910
stage to do things it's the workhorse of

00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:51,910
pipelines and probably across the

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,369
industry those that are using so that's

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,549
innovation that by open sourcing this

00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:59,919
platform you know it wasn't even on our

00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,539
roadmap or probably even on my radar or

00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,519
anyone's radar to write a web hook stage

00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:05,439
but all sudden one came in out of the

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,110
you know out of the dark and now we're

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,760
using it so that's a win-win for

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,159
everybody and and that's just two

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,010
examples of like you know many exams

00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:16,750
exactly because sometimes a lot of

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,610
companies they open-source but they also

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,010
commercialize it you know in one way or

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,569
other but that is not the case with

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,399
Netflix I mean I think you guys will

00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:29,590
just be making you know amazing these TV

00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:31,120
shows that we all love so that's why I

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,559
say more you know interesting to see you

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,940
know what do you get and you're right

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,289
because you no matter how because I was

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,850
talking to hired yesterday and they're

00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:41,500
like Netflix is not on the top you know

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,090
the highest ranking or whatever it is

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,519
called but no matter what you cannot

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,049
hire the best person the brightest man

00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,260
in the world you know what open source

00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:51,639
allows you to work with those people you

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,029
have to improve your product you know

00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:56,830
actually the guy who is working on

00:17:55,029 --> 00:18:01,149
improving your code is getting paid by

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:03,940
your competitor that's what I think also

00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:05,440
the way you know if you again we didn't

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,559
set out to do this with spinnaker but

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,510
you know we there's a vibrant community

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,600
around spinnaker you know we're all here

00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,149
you know in Seattle and what's beautiful

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,289
about that is is not only the innovation

00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:23,889
and the sharing of ideas but

00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,899
you know for example Google or Netflix

00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:27,629
or Apple or the other companies that are

00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:30,580
you know represented at this conference

00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:32,049
from a hiring standpoint like when you

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,039
come to Netflix if you came from a

00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,509
company that was using spinnaker you

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,379
don't have to learn something new or

00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:41,950
vice versa if you are at you know snap

00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:43,749
and you go to Cerner both companies are

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,090
using spinnaker you don't have to learn

00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:47,859
some new custom like Oh at cerner we do

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,789
it this way with this other machinery

00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:54,369
and whatever and so by you know a large

00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:56,320
community we are somewhat creating an

00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:59,109
industry standard what makes that then

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,369
makes it easy for people and new

00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:02,169
employees that have come onto your

00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:03,580
company to just embrace continuous

00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:05,739
delivery and start running as fast as

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,599
possible adding value rather than

00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:09,519
spending let's say like a week in boot

00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,889
camp trying to learn how to use this

00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,509
delivery system versus that one yeah

00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,979
that's also open sources chin otherwise

00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:18,029
earlier you have to go to standard

00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:20,830
bodies to build my open source know you

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:22,929
do pretty standards that become common

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:27,009
in the system or don't have to go to an

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:30,609
ISO to get you know a standard from your

00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:33,129
perspective because as the project is

00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:34,599
growing or the product is going and the

00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:36,580
community is going which one of these

00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:39,970
fees you know you are like this is close

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,619
to your heart yeah because I firmly

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,169
believe that as the community grows the

00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:46,389
product and the project will grow it I

00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:47,950
mean I'm firmly convinced of it it's

00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,840
it's it's I think it's fairly obvious to

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,210
everyone and it's by no means limited to

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,559
the spinnaker you know project Cena with

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:58,029
kubernetes we've seen it with previous

00:19:53,559 --> 00:20:00,650
projects a vibrant community all you

00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:03,419
know running towards the same goal

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,880
we'll we'll create a better project a

00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:09,929
better product one of the things I'm

00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,610
very passionate about and I think we're

00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:14,549
you know we've got a long way to go but

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:17,400
we've made some progress is this idea of

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,960
inclusion right and and leveling the

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,340
playing field so that anyone can get

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,380
involved I think you know before we

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:29,520
formalized a governance policy I suspect

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,559
there was not an intimidation factor but

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,630
when you looked at the spinnaker project

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,929
you saw it as it's Netflix and Google

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,309
and you know a small company and I have

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:41,250
this little need and I don't know how to

00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:43,529
get kind of a seat at the table so I can

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,529
convince these two giant heavyweights to

00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:48,510
meet my needs when in fact we would

00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:50,750
probably be very very engineering that

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,279
but there's this you know this again

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,080
let's say intimidation factor one and I

00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,730
know I can empathize with that because I

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,529
have not always worked at Netflix I was

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,059
at small companies and dreamed of the

00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:01,649
day to sit at a table with Google and

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:04,260
somehow convince them to like use you

00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:07,200
know something I was using so I think by

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:10,049
formalizing a governance policy and

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,020
clarifying how you can affect change in

00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:16,659
the project it's great and we'll build a

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:19,809
more inclusive stronger community than

00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:22,539
we'll build a better project and so

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,129
where do you see community it in that's

00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:25,899
it one or two years and we cannot over

00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:28,119
five years anymore because things are

00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:30,279
changing so fast so okay that's the next

00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,320
you know summit buyback summit where do

00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:33,820
you see it's not about weird where do

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,590
you want to see the community yeah well

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,269
I want to see a much bigger much more

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,919
vibrant so I have numbers so we have 40

00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:40,299
commuters today I would love to see that

00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,919
number be way higher I don't want to set

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:46,989
a target because then I you know what

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:49,749
I'm an engineer I'll game it so I would

00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:52,299
love to see it higher than it is today

00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:54,609
I don't know what that is but I have

00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,460
every expectation should be you know how

00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:59,889
about much that's that's a fairly vague

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,109
but much higher and I want to be more

00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:03,999
diverse right more MORE

00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:07,899
you know women people of color

00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:12,220
regardless in that committer or approver

00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:13,599
list I'd love to see more icons on the

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,940
community list in terms of companies

00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,919
that are leveraging spinnaker I'm firmly

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,830
believe that as more companies leverage

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,450
this platform some will give back to the

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,399
community in some way and it's Akron

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,720
it's not required I can totally get that

00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,979
there are companies that leverage open

00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,629
source and just don't have the resources

00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:30,369
to give back and it's fine there's no

00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:32,649
expectation on the on the part of the

00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:35,580
spinor community but I know some portion

00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:38,979
of companies that leverage spinnaker

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,419
will either you know hopefully submit a

00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:43,029
feature but I know that's there's

00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:45,190
there's a high bar there but maybe

00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,840
they'll they'll submit an issue and

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,749
that's great they may find a bug that we

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,609
hadn't found yet they may update the

00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:53,139
documentation and clarify something that

00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,769
we didn't think of or you know see in a

00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:56,080
different light

00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:58,090
heck they could even fix grammar on the

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,409
website whatever someone will do and

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,489
give back to the community is great and

00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:02,919
I know the only way to get there is to

00:23:00,489 --> 00:23:04,840
get more you know that more more people

00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:06,980
so to speak them work but it is more

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,350
people more people in the community more

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,030
like where where we're taking this thing

00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,160
I will come back to the diversity point

00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,660
before that when I when I look at

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,890
community I may be wrong is I see three

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,299
players you know one is the one who

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,650
created the technology then there is a

00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,540
vendor community they built they

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,400
commercialize it and then there is user

00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,010
community yeah so what kind of balance

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,490
you want to see yeah

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,770
well ideally a lot of users how does

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:34,929
that know I think from a vendor

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,770
standpoint so I so of the three that I

00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,059
might write about for you or there can

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,070
be more or do you think you're right I

00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,320
think you're right and in the vendor and

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,290
the and those that want to communal eyes

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,380
there's somewhat blurry that's fine we

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,190
can we can differentiate those two I

00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,570
firmly believe will see the most

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:55,880
innovation out of the the former two

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:58,760
vendors and and those that wish to

00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:03,140
commercialize products spinnaker itself

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:05,299
or on top end-users though will you know

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,280
if anything what we've learned over the

00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:09,679
last decade is that you know developers

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,360
at the kingmakers right long gone are

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,799
the days where you know the sales guy

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,080
went out and met with the CIO and had

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,100
golf and then the next day you had you

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,630
know error PeopleSoft

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,280
you know signed and it was going to be

00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,230
implemented at your big giant company

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,559
the way it starts today is that

00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:27,380
developers you know will find something

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,390
that is appealing start using it it

00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,950
becomes sticky within a company and then

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,200
within a few months everyone at the

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,760
company is is using it but not because

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,440
they were mandated but but they saw

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,630
there's value like it makes my job

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,669
easier or it saves me you know this does

00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:45,559
something for me and so I'm gonna start

00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:47,630
using it so those end users adopting

00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,340
spinnaker will then grow the community

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,960
because then they'll they'll bring it

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,250
into you know company foo and foo will

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,929
begin to see you spinnaker and then

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,090
start writing let's say extensions to

00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:58,070
make sure that it's integrated

00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,210
you know whatever audit system or

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,820
something like that so we'll still see

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,650
innovations there as well but again

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,600
these the the commercial vendors and

00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,100
you're just the vendors and those than

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,500
the commercial one are obviously very

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,270
incentivized to innovate on top of the

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,120
platform to make you know value-added

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,710
things that would then bring those users

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,110
to it and I think the other thing that's

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,480
interesting that we kind of struggled

00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,220
with in the beginning is there are

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,230
vendors in the ecosystem that are trying

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,260
to make money which is great

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,659
firmly believe in capitalism okay uh-huh

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,039
and but what we kind of struggled with

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:32,299
as a community is well they're building

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,039
stuff but they're not open sourcing it

00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:36,919
and and in fact I think that's fine

00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,080
because it took me a couple

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,909
conversations to realize that in fact at

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,350
Netflix we're doing similar things in

00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:44,029
that we're building stuff on top of

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,190
spinnaker that is not open source like

00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,360
we talked about earlier it's not because

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,649
we're licensing it or anything like that

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,059
it's just up for whatever reason the

00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:51,500
system we're working on is not open

00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:55,309
source Abul because it's you know does

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,600
something unique and so it that's why we

00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:58,250
built this platform so that you can

00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,210
innovate on top of it and you can do it

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,919
in such a manner that you don't you're

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,500
not required to open source those things

00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,500
that let's say plug-in it's better so

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:08,029
building a ecosystem on top of spinnaker

00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,440
and adding some sort of value in and

00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:11,029
attempting to make a business on that I

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,669
think is phenomenal and what we've seen

00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:16,210
is that there is a need for it there's

00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:17,919
more than one company and trying to

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,210
let's say it business on top of

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,129
spinnaker and I think that's it's a it's

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,799
a it's a sign of a healthy ecosystem and

00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:25,269
a healthy project and so I think as a

00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,379
community we should encourage it and we

00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:28,179
do it you know it took a little while to

00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:30,190
figure it out but now people recognize

00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:31,720
hey you know these these vendors are

00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,980
they're giving back in some way there's

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,450
some stuff they're holding proprietary

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,730
let's find they're adding value here and

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,470
there but they're also giving back where

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,119
they see a problem yeah I'm a very

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,029
strong support of open source I have

00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:45,179
been an open source and mukade also but

00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:47,679
over time you know I also realized that

00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,809
sometime in Otago open so we get stuck

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,119
in code so much you forget about the

00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:54,340
ecosystem so I use anology of farming

00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:57,519
you know you are in a field green

00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,529
potatoes rule okay everybody can go to

00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,999
the field and grow potatoes but you need

00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:02,619
transportation companies you know who

00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:04,419
will transport that we need restaurant

00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:06,669
chains you need door - you will deliver

00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:08,619
food to my room be fertilizer fertilizer

00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:10,929
you need you know uncle chips - you know

00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:13,179
Parenthood so you need the whole you

00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,580
know ecosystem around it and not all of

00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:18,190
them will be in the field yeah digging

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,320
potatoes so I same thing I see with open

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,570
source there are you know cook you know

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,309
players who will work on the whole yeah

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,960
but there will be a whole big ecosystem

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,100
because ok you create an open-source

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,249
project ok I got it

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:33,700
what about the day - yeah exactly well

00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:35,379
and you know so yeah I really I've made

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,840
sure in a way that I don't think about

00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:39,220
APIs or just all those you know

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,759
companies who are building you know

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,919
business around it somehow either you

00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:47,559
pay through code or to currency you know

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,200
yeah so you are paying a developer who

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,450
is you know working on that code yep so

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,950
well and I think also the ecosystem is

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,990
big enough where there's room for people

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,429
to play and like you said farming is not

00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,980
just that you know the farmer who's you

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:01,960
know digging up the potato you know case

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,980
in point with spinnaker when we open

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,100
sourced it

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,809
we Netflix and Google we did not

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,300
necessarily prioritize making spinner

00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:10,780
very easy

00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:14,030
install definitely oversight on our part

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:16,490
and as a community we're still making it

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:19,130
easier to install but there was an

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,660
opportunity for again a vendor to come

00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,480
along and say here's a you know a

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,490
packaged version of spinner and I and I

00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,460
still believe that you know so for

00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,110
example at Netflix my team we operate

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,540
spinnaker and when there's a problem or

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,850
there's a question people come to us for

00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:37,310
support and that's a service we provided

00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,770
Netflix I can totally see that at some

00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,600
companies they would want to pay someone

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,990
for that support you know essentially

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,320
the proverbial they need to know a net

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:51,890
neck to choke when something breaks and

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,600
I get it and that that that that use

00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,220
case is played out you know a number of

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,670
different projects throughout our

00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,970
careers

00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:00,320
so like VF teen is kubernetes committee

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,080
there are so many vendors who are in the

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,460
repackaging ribbon a distribution do you

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,010
want to see it that word where people

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,450
have the choice or build verses by

00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:11,330
depending on their use case I think so I

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:13,190
think we need that that's it yeah yup is

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,960
good I should say I was gonna agree I

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,030
have nothing more to add other than I

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,950
think we need it right I've heard it

00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,910
from the community people asking me

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,030
directly

00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:24,590
who can we essentially hire to you know

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,750
get spinnaker up and running in our

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:30,050
company who can you know run it for us

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,490
who can you know help transform into a

00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,320
DevOps culture I mean there's there's

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,450
all these opportunities in the ecosystem

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,460
that again you know Netflix we're really

00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,770
good at making content and that's what

00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,150
we do best and that's what we will do we

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,890
open sourced a platform we hope people

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,750
can innovate build something on top

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,490
and some of their will you know will be

00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,810
over you know reap the benefits and use

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,070
it and flex and vice versa there's

00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,740
innovations we're doing at Netflix that

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:54,230
we're putting into the past

00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,420
yep but one thing with open source that

00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,860
is also critically as I mean yes people

00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,420
like more people to open source their

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,420
code that's for truth

00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:05,630
but sustainability and health yeah how

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:07,250
do you spinnaker is not that new but

00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:10,190
it's valid in we knew the comedians

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:12,020
brain how do you plan to ensure that it

00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,030
is sustainable and it will remain

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,490
healthy yeah well I think the governance

00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:19,070
starting down the governance route is

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,960
the first step there you know we

00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,930
obviously came out of the gate without a

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,980
governance policy knows very much a you

00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,780
know for lack of a better word

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,910
gentlemen's agreement between you know

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,820
spinnaker excuse me between Netflix at a

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,040
Google and that scaled for the first few

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,740
years Stephen my colleague with the

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,330
Google and I noticed probably about a

00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,970
year ago that things were kind of

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,440
growing beyond our ability to to

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,720
effectively manage it you know previous

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,030
to that it was and you've seen it you

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,980
know at this conference it's very much

00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,050
relationship based I know them I know

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,500
them I know them Steven knew them and

00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:58,250
them and so we had a cupboard and we had

00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,320
a very open transparent community where

00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,000
everyone where we encourage every like

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,260
why are you here what why what's what

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,670
are your incentives what why we

00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,080
motivated being this community we're

00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,340
trying to get out of this and I was very

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,130
important for us to establish trust

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:12,050
among the groups like when a vendor came

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,880
you know okay it's clear you're trying

00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,650
to make money so and I made it very

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,180
clear that as Netflix I'm going to work

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,500
at Netflix as best interesting we may

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,910
disagree but at least we know where

00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,230
we're coming from so that you know when

00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:24,020
conflict arises it could work through it

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,190
anyways about a year ago we recognized

00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,700
that they were

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,740
more people slash companies will how

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,500
about entities synonymous things that

00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,980
were voicing opinions coming into

00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,710
discussions that we were unaware of and

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,450
it was becoming difficult for us to to

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,210
manage that you know it's just it's a

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,770
scale thing and so to your question

00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,240
about how we ensure a healthy community

00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,740
going forward is again leveling the

00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,960
playing field and opening it up and

00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,210
saying hey there's a new company you

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,730
know knocking at the gate let's let them

00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:58,490
in and figure out how we can do this in

00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,450
a fair unbiased manner and I think

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,540
another way to keep the community

00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,580
healthy is to do events like this get us

00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,020
together start discussing I think you

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,460
know at every conference the best part

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,780
is the hallway track you know and some

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,810
of the conversations I've had have just

00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,740
been amazing i opening and I suspect I'm

00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,570
not the only one who's had those

00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,800
obviously the sessions themselves have

00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,810
been amazing to see how people are

00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,490
innovating and and you know what new

00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,260
ideas people are coming up with and I

00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,240
think ultimately to keep this community

00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,370
healthy is to have you know humble

00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,980
attitude you know at Netflix we do

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,110
things our way but doesn't mean we're

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,340
not open to learning how other people

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,980
are doing it and this journey has been

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,390
very much lesson in humility in saying

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,090
oh well this is how Google does it this

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:41,540
is how shipstead does it this is how

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:44,210
Google air whatever what you know all

00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,160
these different companies and they do it

00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,200
slightly differently Capital One and in

00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,450
in there are two ways of looking at

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,430
either like you're doing it wrong or oh

00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:54,020
that's really interesting we don't do it

00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,340
that way but I can understand why you do

00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,630
with that and maybe if we did this

00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,550
slightly differently we might actually

00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,680
be able to you know gain that benefit

00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,780
that they're saying so I think that

00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,710
humbleness will enable this to be a

00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:09,250
healthy community that continues to grow

00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:11,530
and expand now I'll come back to the

00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,030
diversity core point that you get why is

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,360
that worse importantly why does it

00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,820
matter

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,740
yeah well I think it matters from the

00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,300
standpoint of creating a healthy

00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:23,820
community right different perspectives

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:26,890
you know I think across the industry the

00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,930
you know if you bring different people

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,270
to the table they will come with

00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:34,330
different perspectives and I think

00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,710
that's ultimately builds a ma it builds

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,770
a better community a stronger community

00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,230
we have already seen from a company

00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,210
standpoint corporate Stanley

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,850
corporations that embrace diversity are

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,830
more successful right this is it's a

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,140
it's a global world at this point right

00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,940
Netflix is a global company this project

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,590
is a global project it's not you know

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:57,970
you need to Silicon Valley white males

00:33:53,590 --> 00:34:00,130
person so I find that as we bring more

00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,470
diverse you know people to the table

00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,930
they bring again different perspectives

00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,310
that I think enable all of us to see

00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,480
things kind of differently whether it be

00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,370
a different company or a different

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,680
person doesn't matter once you kind of

00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:15,520
see it from through their their through

00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:19,150
see things through their lens it's just

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,700
his mind opening so how do you plan to

00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:24,490
ensure that does vinegar community is

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,780
inclusive and diverse enough well I

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,950
think there's a lot more we can do I

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,010
don't know if we're very good at it at

00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:32,560
this point so obviously I keep coming

00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,690
back to the governance policy of making

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,600
it so that it's very clear how you can

00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,820
become a let's say a committer and it's

00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,340
not you know on the whims of me or

00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:45,520
Steven I had a conversation with an

00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,010
individual who's very much interested in

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,040
trying to increase diversity and open

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,420
source and she had a number of different

00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,890
suggestions that again were you know I

00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,000
open it for me in terms of the language

00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:59,380
we use within the community in terms of

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,430
documentation or how to get started can

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:05,170
be exclusive even the conferences that

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,430
we have so in this conference we tried

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,870
to create this notion of a DNI

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:13,630
scholarship but even the way you know I

00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,950
can't come to find out with some some

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,410
feedback from some great folks in the

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,180
community that what the wording was off

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,830
and it not though so much as it scared

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:24,310
people off but it misled them to think

00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:26,620
that the the the application process

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,920
wasn't open when indeed it was so

00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:32,620
there's so many more things we can do to

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,820
make this a more inclusive community and

00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:37,000
I don't pretend to have all the answers

00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,560
right now but I think ultimately if as a

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,240
community we embrace it and know that

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,740
like there's so much more we can be

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,230
doing and we're open to feedback I think

00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:48,220
is a great start you know that's a very

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:50,140
you know interesting point that how you

00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,810
know hope you may not be sensitive

00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,550
enough to understand so when you bring

00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,680
those people then they will bring that

00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,970
value with them yeah

00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,470
and that's you know that's a very good

00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,109
approach towards making it on medium

00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,719
brilliant

00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:05,239
yeah in fact you know a question I

00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,880
received right before the conference and

00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:10,400
I didn't have an answer was you know

00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,890
what do we do about like do we have some

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,929
program for child care and it didn't

00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,789
even cross my mind I have four kids but

00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:18,739
I'm fortunate in that you know my my

00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:20,900
better half is able to watch them but I

00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:23,329
totally recognize that you know there

00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,929
are people that don't have that option

00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:29,390
and it and I feel terrible for not even

00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:30,890
having you know thought of it and so

00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,549
next year I think that's something we're

00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:36,619
at the figure that is okay if you if

00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:40,069
coming to the conference or if childcare

00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:41,539
or the inaccessibility of child care is

00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:42,650
a reason for you not to be able come to

00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:44,059
this conference I think that's something

00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,549
we should look into to see how we can

00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:49,369
get fix that's just one example there's

00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:49,640
probably a million of things we could do

00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:51,319
better

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,390
yeah I was walking in the room in out

00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:55,789
looking for you and I saw a couple of

00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:58,549
kids actually up one of the events that

00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:02,119
I go to every year is Linux con yeah and

00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:04,099
I started going to 2009 before I was

00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,900
married and then we got son so I had

00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,339
been bringing my son and little story

00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,439
we'll see when he saw and he showed me

00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:11,089
his picture day I saw your son so he

00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:12,380
would be renewed two years old he'll be

00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:13,910
running in the content and it just

00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,199
changes the environment yeah because

00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,479
suddenly because all of us you know

00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,939
sometimes people say oh you are not

00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:21,589
you're not very nice on the but you know

00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:23,150
when we go home we have sisters brothers

00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:25,039
kids you know we're not so when you

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,829
bring that you create that environment

00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,479
we become what we are you know good nice

00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:32,359
people you know who love to talk to each

00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:34,999
other so the DEA have it started of this

00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:37,309
next foundation they have started their

00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:40,160
care and their event yeah okay that's

00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:43,219
great yeah so what happens is a lot of

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,049
parents they both work Soniya now are

00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,519
able to come to the event they drop

00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:48,199
their kids in the which sometime

00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:49,939
happened to be the same venue they just

00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,289
hire some nannies and they wash them in

00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:54,049
the room they have a lot of toys and

00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:56,150
they play with them and then the whole

00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:57,829
family's together and then what they've

00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:00,469
also started doing is that final day

00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:02,689
they organize a kid's day yeah where

00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:04,489
somebody teaches kids how to code yeah

00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:05,809
and all those HTML kind of thing so I

00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:08,240
think that would be amazing for a

00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:10,700
spinnaker community I agree too

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,230
yeah it won't be a lot of investment but

00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,540
it will be amazing for the whole

00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,190
families to come together and be at the

00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,500
event yeah that's a great idea thank you

00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,930
for bringing that up I would love you

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,010
know next year to have that option that

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,970
would be incredible and there's nothing

00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,710
better you know to bring the whole

00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:27,170
family together right these events

00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:29,480
should bring families together yeah well

00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,790
you know it's funny because yesterday an

00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,520
individual here he did bring his family

00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:36,260
he has two young children and they were

00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,570
running around you know the exhibitor

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,520
floor and you can't help but smile you

00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:42,290
know when you see kids and so even from

00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,180
that standpoint yeah suddenly well no

00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,880
matter what is just you have you know

00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,440
and and I Mike it became so kind of you

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,780
know regular that you know people now

00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,160
they are big yeah hey there sorry I know

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,680
we don't bring him anymore because

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,060
that's cool it's cool but now he is

00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,260
saying daddy I can come with you and

00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,270
help you with this stuff is seven years

00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:02,930
old I said so maybe I'll start bringing

00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:04,460
him next year yeah yeah okay that big so

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,170
we talked about technology a lot let's

00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:09,320
talk about you for a while that when

00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:12,020
you're not secretly watching season

00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,780
three what do you do in your free time

00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:17,450
yeah so I do have a big family I have

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,710
four awesome children so I try to spend

00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,840
as much time as possible with them and

00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,730
go to their events in fact tomorrow I'll

00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,530
be heading out of Seattle early to go

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:26,990
see one of my son's championship

00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:30,950
volleyball game and then the other thing

00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:35,150
I do I like to exercise so I like to do

00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:36,770
triathlons and ultra marathons and

00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,940
there's it's pretty selfish thing for me

00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,090
to do because it takes time away from

00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:43,820
you know my beautiful family and wife

00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:46,640
but they let me because they know

00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,810
yeah that's why do on the side so should

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,090
we expect that okay for the next

00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,070
spinnaker summit number one is one of

00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,670
the days we will have a morning early

00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,530
morning run

00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,540
that'd be great and second would be dick

00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,130
here yes thank you

00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,840
in a run maybe you're gonna swim in a

00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,600
