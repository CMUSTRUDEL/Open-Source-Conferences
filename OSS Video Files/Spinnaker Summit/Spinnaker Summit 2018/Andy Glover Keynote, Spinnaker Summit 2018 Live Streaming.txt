00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:19,529
think he needs much introduction let's

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:22,039

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,570
summit it is indeed a legit conference

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,040
now in fact if someone was saying

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,700
because we're in a hotel that means we

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,899
are legit as opposed to last year's

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:51,030
summit where it was ultimately at

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:53,250
Netflix and I put it together and it was

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,100
a blast but I learned quickly that I

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,190
never ever want to plan a conference

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,199
again but I do want to say thanks for

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,910

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,110
feedback we got after last year was we

gonna be the best keynote ever so I want

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,250
to take you through what's happened over

00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,440
the last year with spinnaker and so it

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,139
has been a it's been a phenomenal year

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,060
spinnaker in more than one way has just

00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:12,239
grown tremendously and last year we've

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,280
seen a 45 increase 45 percent increase

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,660
and the number of contributors

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,859
contributors across a handful of github

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,850
repos and I think many of you who are

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,770
part of that stat are here today

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,790
the last 60 days alone we've had over a

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:30,340
thousand PRS our slack channel which

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,340
hopefully everyone is a member of has as

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,250
of yesterday five thousand four hundred

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,430
and seventy one members communicating

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,110
across sixty two channels one thing that

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,910
I have noted is more than one person

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,610
throughout the year has suggested that

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,310
we we we no longer use the free version

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,740
of slack which i think is a great idea

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,370
does anyone know how slack charges

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:59,020
anyone from slack here it's seven

00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:01,030
dollars a user per month that's like 40

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,720
grand a month so I'm looking for

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,160
volunteers to to pony that up but yeah

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,240
we got to figure that one out we have

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,820
some friends at slack so we'll have a

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,800
couple of conversations but we will look

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,510
to see what we can do about making slack

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,240
the Enterprise version where you know

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,040
you don't lose history and whatnot but

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,830
needless to say we have a lot of people

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:25,540
in slack and we've added quite a few

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,230
different logos to spinnaker i/o over

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,340
the last year I know this is not

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,160
everybody or every company that's

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,760
leveraging spinnaker so if you do want

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:45,250
your your company's logo up there please

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:47,770
send us a PR we've spun up a community

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,780
forum in fact at last year's summit this

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,690
is one of the the ask that came out

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,660
people said hey because you are using

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,850
the free version of slack you cheapos we

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,660
lose history conversations get lost you

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,030
want something a little bit more

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,210
permanent so we actually were listening

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,950
and we set up discourse and you can get

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,440
to it at community that's been occur do

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,090
this is a you know slack is great for

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,820
real-time conversations but sometimes

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,920
those conversations get lost so this is

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,110
an excellent place to engage in

00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:23,980
discussions ask questions and propose

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:27,820
new features and I'm really excited that

00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:30,610
this year a couple of folks wrote a

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,850
spinnaker book those folks are Emily

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,660

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,480

community in a very big way they are

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,710

like lambda integration Fargate

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,990
integration along with improving our

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:37,430

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,509
valued member of the community spinnaker

00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:17,339
ecosystem so thank you all for the

00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,649
innovations and support you are

00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:24,449
providing to to make this a truly

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:27,930
vibrant community there's also been

00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:29,759
myriad exciting innovations in spinnaker

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:34,709
over the last year and I'd like to share

00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:37,290
a number of them with you so first and

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:39,899
foremost last year Netflix and Google

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,449
teamed up to bring automated canary

00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,639
analysis to the masses Kanto was

00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:48,750
released early this year to a lot of

00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,819
fanfare for what it's worth at Netflix

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,939
we leveraged automated canary analysis

00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:56,430
via KY Anza in spinnaker to ensure the

00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:59,480
Netflix experience works for over 30

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,130
million members around the globe it is a

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,370
vital aspect of the

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,810
we at Netflix I know that obviously

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,490
canarian is also a vital aspect of

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:14,460
deliberateness our excuse me at Google

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:16,890
as well and so it is now Conte is a

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,390
first-class or I should say automated

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,780
canary analysis is now a first-class

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,520
aspect of spinnaker you can use this as

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:30,090
a part of your release process and

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:31,680
better yet it comes out of the box we

00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,710
made it to be pluggable so it comes out

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,210
of the box with four data sources or

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,240
metric sources that you can plug in

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,970
Atlas is which is Netflix's telemetry

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,010
service we provided this integration

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,840
Google added stack driver and Prometheus

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,020
and then the good folks armory added

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,420
data dog so thank you very much for all

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:57,660
the innovations that you all and the

00:11:51,420 --> 00:12:01,560
community have provided to canta anyone

00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,750
here heard of a kubernetes yeah

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,610
obviously kubernetes is you know eating

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,530
the world so to speak it's a phenomenal

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,420
platform and the the Google team along

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,040
with many of you in the community have

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:15,060
been working to make the kubernetes

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:22,170
experience in spinnaker amazing and in

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:24,000
fact the the v2 provider embraces

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,250
manifest driven deployments while

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,290
upholding the qualities that make

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:33,060
spinnaker such a powerful continuous

00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:35,670
delivery platform there's a ton of talks

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,250
on kubernetes so I suspect they'll be

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:42,930
quite full lars if you have questions

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:45,660
just ask lars directly forgot to put

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,890
your cell phone number on this but no

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,200
but thank you for all the community

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:53,750
who's working here on the kubernetes

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,750
integration and spinnaker it's amazing

00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:00,630
early this year Netflix OSS released our

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,770
container management platform called

00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:08,070
Titus Titus powers critical aspects of

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:10,500
the Netflix business ranging from video

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,270
streaming recommendations machine

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,240
learning Big Data content encoding

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,730
studio technology internal engineering

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,620
tools

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,959
other Netflix workloads we have been

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,839
working on the tightest integration and

00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,790
spinnaker since the early days and now

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,290
it is all open sourced and is a

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,910
additional option for container

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,459
workloads at in your particular company

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,820
we do have a tightest talk Corrin raise

00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,820
your hand

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:44,470
silence when do you speak corn this

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:54,760
afternoon 4:30 come listen to core and

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:57,250
talk about Titus this year at Netflix we

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,610
added support for firmware delivery to

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,110
our open connect appliance our open

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:08,139
connect appliances across the globe so

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:11,199
we added this into spinnaker Netflix is

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:13,389
well known for obviously leveraging AWS

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,600
the entire control plane of the Netflix

00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:19,029
experience is is in AWS so when you sign

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,790
into Netflix everything you see and

00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:24,850
touch and interact with is ultimately

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:28,209
served up from AWS however once you

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,000
press play on whatever episode or you

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:32,889
know piece of content you want to watch

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,110
those that stream is actually streamed

00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:37,810
to you from a data center closest to

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,610
your geographic location and the boxes

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:44,260
in those data centers are called open

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:46,449
connect appliances the the team that

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,180
owns those boxes or manages those boxes

00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:51,550
regularly does updates to the firmware

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,769
and they are now leveraging spinnaker

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:58,839
there's a talk tomorrow

00:14:53,769 --> 00:15:02,260
about this mark yep tomorrow so what's

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,839
what time 11:45 so this is another

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,699
example of the innovations that you can

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,529
you can build into spinnaker we of

00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:11,110
course built this platform to be

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:13,149
pluggable whether it be stages whether

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,980
it be what the artifact you want to

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,050
deliver or where you want to deliver it

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,750
to so this is a great stack a study in

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:24,459
terms of leveraging spinnaker for

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,710
various aspects of the enterprise we've

00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:27,080
all

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,850
added first-class support for library

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,440
management by integrating spinnaker with

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,170
an internal de pellit dependency

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,300
management system at Netflix this allows

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,320
library developers to affect delivery of

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:41,450
their artifacts and gain unprecedented

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,610
visibility into their library's

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,920
consumption across the Netflix ecosystem

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,580
again another example of extending

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:56,510
spinnaker to effect reliable safe

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:58,190
confident delivery at Netflix there's

00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,750
also been a ton of work I know

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:04,430
spearheaded by the good folks at Google

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:07,130
on spinnaker CLI is that all you matter

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:11,290
is that somebody else Jake are you

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:13,250
speaking about that at all No

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,300
all right so there's office hours you

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,400
want to learn more about the spinnaker

00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,520
command-line interface come talk to Jake

00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,360
and also we've done a lot of work for

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,590
typed execution context to allow for

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:33,110
artifact tracing throughout your

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:36,110
pipelines so all the innovation that's

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:39,200
happened in the last year is super

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,360
incredible but we want to make it even

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,480
easier for people to get involved in the

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,540
spinnaker ecosystem so earlier this year

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,100
both Netflix and Google started talking

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,700
about how we could more formalize the

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:56,630
project how its run and clarify how

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:59,000
people could get involved so I'm really

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,200
excited to announce that both methods

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,810
and Google have worked together and

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,990
established a governance plan very much

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:08,300
modeled after the many is very much

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:13,670
modeled in many ways after kubernetes

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:16,130
governance plan the plan clarifies how

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,980
anyone can get involved in the project

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,230
and eventually become an approver or

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,450
committer so everyone here in the

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:28,220
ecosystem is an active community member

00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:31,430
and from there you can move on to be a

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:36,400
formalized for viewer and then obviously

00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:36,400
from a reviewer you can then become

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,580
their

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:47,630
yah-hey doesn't sit on that one and

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:49,790
approver the approver is a committer the

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,430
plan establishes a technical oversight

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,980
committee that is responsible for the

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,620
overall technical management of the

00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,560
project and ultimately managing the

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,080
day-to-day running of the project it is

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:08,480
this oversight committee that will

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:12,020
approve reviewers and approvers we also

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,430
established a steering committee the

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,440
responsibility of the steering committee

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:20,330
is the continual shaping of the

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,020
governance structure of this of this

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,250
project we'll also address questions or

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,150
concerns from the community about the

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,070
project culture its structure and we

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:35,480
will attempt to clarify roles and

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:41,210
responsibilities and duties of special

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:44,080
interest groups if you'd like to get

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,220
more information about the new

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,290
governance policy it's on the website

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:55,940
and we have office hours I did remember

00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:58,700
this Stephen tomorrow at some time in

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,410
the morning but no if you have questions

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,950
about the governance policy how you can

00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:06,620
get involved or concerns or whatnot

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,630
feedback please come and talk to me or

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:12,820
Stephen we will be at office hours on

00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,540
Tuesday at 11:30 or something like that

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,070
Stephens over there if you want to get a

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:21,980
good look at them so today it committed

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,400
the the spinnaker ecosystem our

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,720
community we have over 40 approvers and

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,540
I know I speak for everyone in the

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,010
ecosystem when I say next year at this

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,310
time I'd love that number to be a lot

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:37,970
higher I think what we've learned in the

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:40,070
last couple of years is that well first

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,050
of all we didn't really need a

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,490
governance policy out the gate we've

00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,620
we've largely been able to function

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,150
without one however in the last year

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,460
we've come to realize the project is

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,230
growing it's huge and we want to make it

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,929
an even playing field for anyone to get

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:57,860
involved

00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:59,210
this this process I think clarifies who

00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,620
can get a seat at the table and how to

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,929
get there it's no longer this subjective

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,400
oh you have to know you know somebody

00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:07,340
and be a friend of a friend of you know

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:12,309
Steven to get the to get the nod so to

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:16,490
speak and so we are most hopeful that by

00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:19,580
formalizing how the project is run that

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:23,419
we'll see more approvers more reviewers

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,880
and ultimately get more innovations when

00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:27,890
you innovate we all win the more people

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,860
using spinnaker is is a plus for all of

00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,140
us and so it's our hope that by

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:38,299
clarifying how we govern this project

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:40,520
everyone can get involved this is a

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:45,590
thriving ecosystem as witnessed by all

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:48,530
of us here in Seattle for two days it's

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:52,280
clear to me that the more people that

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:56,150
use this platform the better and so it's

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,040
my sincere desire that everyone gets

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,280
more formally involved in this project

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,720
and it's not just you know the domain of

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,400
Netflix and Google and so I hope next

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,840
year most people in this room are

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,120
somehow involved more formally with this

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,730
project I hope it's a more inclusive

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,490
ecosystem where anyone can get involved

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,950
and affect delivery and the future of

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,150
continuous delivery and spinnaker so

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,240
thank you very much I'm looking forward

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:27,820
to an epic two days and I hope that I

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,820
get to meet everyone here thanks again

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,049

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,720

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,030

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,310
really psyched about that the kind of

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,610
the layout here so you're here on floor

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,830
three of course with this is the floor

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,200

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,990
in this room on this stage but we have

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,710
six other breakout rooms so they're

00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:43,100
they're scattered throughout floor four

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:44,810
above us and they're it's a pretty

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,080
pretty intimate setting but basically

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:51,290
they're all around this the the column

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,670
around the outside of four four so and

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,500

00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,290

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,360
