I just want to go to part with two

00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,000
thoughts number one hopefully they

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,109
should be obvious to all of us and I

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,780
think these two points are important

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:15,030
because whether we are cloud providers

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:20,789
technologists users at the end of the

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:23,820
day we want to make our users trek to

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,900
the cloud a successful one and I think

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,250
to that point really there are two

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,939
things that I want to continue to remind

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,759
us of number one is that we are in the

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,010
continuous delivery problem domain right

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,170
and so this relates to a lot of

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,879
questions that you get about

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,530
alternatives to using something like

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,570
spinnaker or harness also joining the

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,520
continuous delivery fight but we are

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,980
sourced in continuous delivery and there

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,270
is a specific set of problems in that

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,850
domain that we're trying to go to solve

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,690
right so I talked about how in the whole

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,640
dev tools chain from source all the way

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,190
to CI and build and whatnot out to

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,140
operationalizing these things there's a

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,270
lot of information there's a certain

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,010
subset of that information which is

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,540
important to us to go and solve the

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,189
problems to continuous delivery so once

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,290
again continuous delivery is about

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,619
making safe repeatable deployments out

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,290
to the cloud in our situation so really

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,780
that comes down to managing change as

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,090
you roll that out and operationalizing

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,369
it so what is the change getting

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,860
visibility into that change what happens

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,939
when change goes wrong those are the

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,119
problems that we're trying to go to

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,280
solve for our organizations and our

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,310
users and that comes down to specific

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,920
things like artifact management you know

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,960
and it begs questions around what is the

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,210
right interaction model with adjacent

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,729
systems like CI systems for example

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,840
things that we need to do down to

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,210
operationalizing

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,850
these things what information do we need

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,320
golden surface what are the first class

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,329
and four pieces of information that we

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,770
need to be really good about treating so

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,590
I want to encourage us to continue to

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,000
think about those things and also be

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,770
very the corollary is to be very

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,439
deliberate about things that we don't

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,229
need to really focus on so I've said

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,550
many times beniker is probably in

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,200
general not a good general-purpose

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,069
Orchestrator for example so when people

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,340
ask

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,200
pinnacle 4c I may be as an umbrella tool

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,129
but to solve a CI problem maybe we

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,150
probably wouldn't recognize I'll

00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,150
recommend that you go in that direction

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,560
so doing the fewer things knowing what's

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,980
important to us doing those things very

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,299
very well okay so once again from those

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,540
of us who are contributing and

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:35,579
developing representing our respective

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,780
cloud platforms I want to encourage us

00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:38,969
remind us to go and I think about that

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,980
and then also for all of you who are

00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:43,590
here probably a lot of people who are

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,480
operating building out what platform

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,129
means for you guys what your

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,379
organization is Trek to the cloud or

00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,090
from one form of cloud to another form

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,290
of cloud weathers containerization or

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,230
going server lists what that looks like

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,609
you guys are pioneering that change and

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,799
trying to enable your developers to get

00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,750
there and so please be deliberate about

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,590
what we go after and what that really is

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,609
that's number one number two is the

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,109
unique thing about continuous delivery

00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:10,799
is that it is the front door to the

00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:12,629
platform I say this a lot different than

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,000
let's say CI concerns which is about

00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,180
green repose and keeping that trunk

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,530
headmaster going really really clean

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,180
continuous delivery is unique data sits

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,400
immediately adjacent to the runtime

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,169
platform and it is a front door right so

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,650
for example we can't go ahead and take a

00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,269
platform like kubernetes and say here's

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,930
the API here's documentation

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:36,810
good luck really most organizations out

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,030
there at large scale don't want 5,000

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,829
engineers have to go to ramp up on the

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,329
kubernetes manifests and labels and

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,449
annotations and things like that right

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:47,220
so the tooling specifically continuous

00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:51,599
delivery becomes the front door to that

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,759
now that gap is immense where ideally we

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,219
want our developers to go and operate at

00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:01,739
and where the platform sits this is our

00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:04,259
obligation or responsibility or burden

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,049
to go and do well so it's imperative

00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:09,419
that continue to go and abstract

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,949
simplify and power so that's all I

00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,810
really wanted to go out and say come

00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:14,609
speak to me outside you guys like to I

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,859
want to go to thank everybody for making

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:22,260
the time to ord and check out here this

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:24,930
community is built on the people who are

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,949
trying to go and lead the charge on

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,870
what's the right way to do these things

00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:31,020
with opinions but they must be

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,030
met with and validated in real life

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,730
organizations I've always felt that

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,770
that's very very special about spinnaker

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,800
is that there's almost nothing that we

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,880
put out there that some major

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,520
organization or organizations are

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,479
running and validating that really goes

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,220
and works which is very different than

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,600
other areas where people might have

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,800
conjectures about the right way to do

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,800
things but it's kind of unvalidated

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,630
right so it's really really important

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,060
that we go ahead and continue to work as

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,360
a community I look forward to the next

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,330
year we go ahead and get together again

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,070
Pete will be sending out a request for

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,020
feedback based on what you guys thought

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,690
of the conference what you guys like to

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,650
go to see in the next year so we will

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,979
continue to build this community

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,120
together

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,979
I'd really ask that you go and

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,340
participate in that all right thank you

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:23,390
very much safe travels

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:25,450
[Applause]

00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,450
