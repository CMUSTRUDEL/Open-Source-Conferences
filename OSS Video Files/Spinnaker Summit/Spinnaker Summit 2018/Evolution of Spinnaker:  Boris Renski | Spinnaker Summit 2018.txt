00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,630
the Boris we are here again at this

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,940
vinegar summit yes the first real

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,180
spinnaker supposed real yeah so what

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,980
role has been displayed in this submit

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:25,050
well we are the highest level sponsor I

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,869
know there's the diamond sponsor which

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,090
is Netflix and they basically put on the

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:35,070
show but we are the highest level

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:38,400
sponsor we basically worked very closely

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,340
with the Netflix team on actually you

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,579
know figuring out components of the

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,270
agenda we have multiple talks here I'm

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,149
gonna be doing a keynote tomorrow on you

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,040
know the possibility of spinnaker

00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:54,570
becoming a standard for continuous

00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,750
delivery much like kubernetes is a

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:02,040
standard for container scheduling we you

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,270
know since we've talked actually

00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,259
launched spinnaker training

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,930
certification and actually the big focus

00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:11,550
for us and this summit is promoting that

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,430
training certification we believe that

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:18,840
you know open source projects follow a

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,340
certain adoption curve and spinnaker is

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,500
still kind of you know at the place

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,470
where there's a few power users but most

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,540
users are kind trying to evangelize

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,250
spinnaker in their organization try to

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,350
get the broader organizational buy-in

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,750
try to get more development teams to use

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,240
it and things like training

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,750
certification is a way to actually help

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,600
accelerate that so we are investing in

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,720
that heavily but yeah I mean that's

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,280
that's us at the summit right we talked

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,740
last time I think they've talked about

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,720
its making a couple of times so we are a

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,750
spinnaker community today the community

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,780
is growing if you look at just the

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,700
dynamic of the spinnaker slack Channel

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,070
which Andy likes to talk about and I

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,990
think we've you know early projects

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,490
looking at things like that is one of

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,160
the ways to actually measure of a

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,619
project velocity so he mentioned there

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,570
is like fifty four hundred or something

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,430
like that act to the users in a

00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,739
spinnaker slack Channel but most

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,459
importantly like you know the growth

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,980
right and who is there that I think is

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,990
important to pay attention to so

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,569
it's adding probably like a hundred

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,150
hundred fifty new people that are coming

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,560
into the channel because they want to

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,630
kind of start interacting on community

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,120
every month right so it's a substantial

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:42,240
substantial growth the I think

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,300
interesting aspect and it's kind of like

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,190
a double-edged sword of you know who are

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,720
the people that are coming into the

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,100
spinnaker community who are the people

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,550
that are participating in the select

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,120
Channel

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,470
so if you look at that for instance like

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,100
the history of OpenStack it was mostly

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:03,269
during the initial wave of growth very

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,700
vendor dominated there's a lot of

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,900
vendors and there's people from all

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,570
kinds of big companies sitting so

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,340
spinnaker is actually a kind of like

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,450
almost an overcorrection in the opposite

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,060
direction where it's very heavily user

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,220
dominated so most of the people in the

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,560
spinnaker slack channel are actually

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,450
users that are doing something of

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,070
spinnaker and you know the common wisdom

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,299
is like oh it's great because there's

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,640
adoption there and there's a lot of

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:36,120
users but I think that for any open

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,370
source community to really be healthy

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,760
and to thrive there has to be a certain

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,560
balance between vendors and users and

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:48,780
users indication of adoption and users

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:52,110
actually help kind of define the roadmap

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,150
in terms of real problems that exist

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,700
within the you know platform

00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,239
architecture but the vendors are the

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,750
ones that are able to take on kind of a

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,739
longer-term bigger strategic problems so

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,420
if I'm you know like a user of spinnaker

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,940
like Salesforce for instance and I have

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,260
a problem with you know the architecture

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,950
and the different services being too

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,269
chatty like you need to do a lot of work

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,280
to solve that problem

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,620
I can maybe like make a plug in or write

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,870
a patch if I'm a user but I'm not gonna

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,020
invest into like a fifteen twenty person

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,419
team and pull a large kind of a rewrite

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,280
or a architecture initiative right so

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:34,830
the vendors can typically take care of

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,440
the longer-term roadmap items

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,390
and I think that the user part is really

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,120
kinda solved in a spinnaker context and

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,460
there's a lot of contributions but the

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,960
vendor part it's like just Google and

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Netflix the most part other people

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,860
contributing so I think that the next

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,340
wave of growth for the community has to

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,980
be you know various vendors also

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,260
investing and backing the community with

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,020
you know team's resources that can work

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,920
on solving some of these bigger problems

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,960
so what is the reason that the spinnaker

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,330
community is so different from let's say

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,620
is OpenStack community the balance

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,420
between the vendor versus of the users

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,130
yeah it has to do with just you know the

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,690
history of how the community has evolved

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,660
and how the community has been kind of

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:26,910
advertised and promoted so OpenStack

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:32,730
community almost kind of a started as an

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:34,830
answer to you know the lack of open

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,930
source cloud standard that they could

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,030
sell so Amazon was taking over the world

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,620
everybody wanted cloud everybody wanted

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,210
private cloud they were coming to their

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,760
vendor of choice you know I work of

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,370
Cisco or I work with HP or Oracle and

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,750
they're like okay give me an alternative

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,550
that is in my data center and they're

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,350
like well we don't have it and then an

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,750
open stack was born all of the vendors

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,460
just swarmed and said oh that's it you

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,380
know now we have a standard for it and

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,630
they started investing in it and there

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,730
was very heavily then there dominated

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,160
whereas the user base kind of tagged

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,410
along and started growing later right

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,540
and there's a foundation around it right

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,600
away now if you look at the evolution of

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,090
spinnaker it was you know a written by a

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,210
user effectively to solve their specific

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,550
problem Netflix and they kind of open

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,500
source to just because you know to show

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,870
how cool Netflix is I'm for recruiting

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,840
purposes there is no plan really to

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,250
actually grow a real community or make

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,230
it something that vendors would take

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,050
advantage of and they've been running

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,120
like that for several years right so it

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,430
was very closed

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,100
you know just Netflix and then Google

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,960
joined later and most of the people that

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,120
actually comprise the community are not

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,100
the ones that were taking it and trying

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,580
to sell it they're ones that like just

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,379
all netflix is doing it so

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,629
you know I'll take it and I also use it

00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,280
for my own internal needs so the user

00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:56,949
community kind of grew but there's no

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,629
formal governance and no foundation and

00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:02,110
no promotion and no vendor involvement

00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:04,419
so it over grew this kind of a user part

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,150
of the community with fairly little

00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:08,500
vendor involvement

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,810
it has also something to do with that

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,219
there was already a big challenge for

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,319
the continuous delivery and suddenly

00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:16,599
they had a solution it was already being

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,889
used not in case of OpenStack or the

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,940
community which is being developed it

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:23,740
was already used internally so you're

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,690
talking about its format for the users

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,069
user so we got there they were looking

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,419
at the technology because all improving

00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,759
itself it's not like they're starting

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:33,069
something from the ground up yes yes and

00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,050
I think a lot of it also was not even so

00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,300
much like let me build a continuous

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,789
delivery thing internally it's more like

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,190
you know one of the best practices for

00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:45,669
going to public cloud that was the main

00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:48,129
driver because Netflix is famous for

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,779
being V guys that were the first ones to

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:52,419
go all-in on public cloud and

00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,129
specifically Amazon right so and and and

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,840
the guys that were following we're like

00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:58,029
okay well how do we do that how to

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,430
replicate that success how do we deploy

00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,590
to cloud like and as this initiative

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,580
starts we're like oh well Netflix is

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,889
doing spinnaker

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,529
or let me do spinnaker too and that

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:13,150
actually fueled a lot of the adoption

00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:15,400
among the users right so it can't can it

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,110
be seen as the answer to the continuous

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:24,219
delivery problem that we are facing or

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:26,319
we are still well so you know look

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:28,449
there's I wouldn't say that there is

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,300
like a continuous delivery problem out

00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:34,719
there right there is you know an

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,930
evolving pattern where companies are

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,659
starting to you know adopt and starting

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,599
to kind of you know continuously deliver

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:47,260
their products so it's like a new way of

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:49,149
basically building software and it's not

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,740
like there's a problem of continuous

00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,079
delivery there's a problem with it being

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:59,560
early and it's also being very heavily

00:08:53,079 --> 00:09:00,840
dominated by DIY solutions and being

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,010
very fragmented

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:08,310
and I think that what spinnaker brings

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,280
to the table is a way to kind of a

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,730
consolidate the market around you know a

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,470
single best practice a single answer

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:24,420
kind of a standard for how you do

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:26,160
continuous delivery and so yeah I mean

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,290
that's that's basically it and then they

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,240
become certain that I have it's kind of

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:34,800
like OpenStack was very quick to solve

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,930
the you know that the private cloud

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,790
problem right but when it comes to

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,230
continuous delivery it's it's higher up

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:46,320
the stack and the DIY solutions I'm more

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,390
sticky because when you get higher up

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,010
the stack there is value of course in

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,480
Spinnaker's technology but there's also

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:56,700
a lot of value in the best practices and

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,010
the business process that you as a

00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:03,000
company have encoded into your DIY

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:05,070
solution right and because it's so

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,330
tightly connected to like the business

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,670
process the you know it's not very easy

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:17,130
to go ahead and replace you know Jenkins

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:22,020
plus DIY with spinnaker and you know

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:23,400
ultimately you know I think that it's

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,100
gonna happen the question is you know

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,610
how long is gonna take and how fast can

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,070
something like spinnaker displace a lot

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,050
of the DIY that's out there for doing

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,350
continuous delivery so what is the

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,940
biggest hurdle customer users face than

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,940
they adopt and embraced spinnaker

00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,350
I mean it's first of all there's a bunch

00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,690
of stuff which is typical of any new

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,280
community that is not specific to

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,910
spinnaker like you know lack of

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,980
resources you know there is no you know

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,380
single way for getting spinnaker

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,740
deployed or you know one prescribed way

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,120
for doing spinnaker eta so you know

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,160
people kind of coming in on their

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,130
learning and experimenting and some

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,720
experiments actually fail and to you

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,580
know make them more successful they need

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,890
more expertise or they try to find

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,990
people that know how to do spinnaker and

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,089
there's not that many of them so all of

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:23,600
this kind of a standard early adoption

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:28,230
hurdles and also I think there are few

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:33,870
kind of a fundamental problems with the

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:37,649
spinnaker architecture that kind of me

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:42,029
to over time evolved away let's put it

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:44,910
this way one of the biggest is you know

00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,070
the issue of you know how easy it is to

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,170
plug it in to something right so the

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,570
issue of plug ability with spinnaker so

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,980
on the positive side everybody in the

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,079
community if you hear like Andy Glover

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,149
talk he says that ability is paramount

00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:02,040
that's you know one of the core tenets

00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:05,250
but because it evolved as like a Netflix

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,430
centric tool to solve their specific

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:12,089
problem they never really thought about

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,589
building like a very reusable pluggable

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,660
framework so when we're talking about

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,940
writing a plug-in for spinnaker like if

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,980
I want to plug into my like database

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,190
back-end or I want to write a new custom

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,290
deployment stage or very common is that

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,250
like I want it to work with you know

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:31,620
Amazon DTS rather than ec2 or some other

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,660
cloud service what that means is that

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,209
you actually need to like fork the code

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,769
you need to go in and change the code

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:39,690
and some of the components with a lot of

00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:41,970
dependencies including changes to the UI

00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,800
to make that work and then you merge the

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,540
code back you can't actually like you

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,459
know create a new repo and just write a

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,589
plug-in following specific set of rules

00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:51,570
that you know talks to Pacific limited

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,279
set of API so I'm just you know blop it

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,260
there and make it work it's really

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,269
actually changing the core code of the

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,310
platform right and I think that this

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,019
concept of plug ability is paramount to

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,940
the success and growth of any open

00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:04,589
source community and particularly to

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,910
open source community that is in a CD

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:12,750
space and like you know as we've kind of

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:14,820
dwelled into the spinnaker world this

00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,920
has been the number one problem with our

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,510
customers like because every customer

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,029
has a slightly different you know

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,980
deployment target slightly different set

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:25,649
of things that me to interface with a

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,660
continuous delivery tool and being able

00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,670
to do it very quickly and seamlessly

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,250
all these plugins is very important and

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:35,910
I think that spinnaker community could

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,860
do probably a you know some important

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,540
work on evolving Spinnaker's

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,940
architecture towards being more plug and

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,970
friendly great and when we talk about a

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,600
spinnaker community have you finalized

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:51,990
any any governance model around it yet

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,840
so you probably saw that Andy has

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,830
announced just as keynote this morning

00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,230
the first kind of you know draft of a

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,730
governance model that's been adopted

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,920
which is a huge leap forward if you

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,660
remember we talked six months ago was a

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,940
cube con and I was talking about you

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,900
know that potentially becoming the next

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,960
important thing for them so today there

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,180
is you know if before I'm a contributor

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,340
like you know there's I have to

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,780
basically like no Steven Kim or in the

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,180
Glover or I'll go like make some friends

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,550
in a slack Channel like how you become a

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,470
committer how do you contribute there's

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,250
no way to do it now they've actually

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:36,840
formalized that it's not very detailed

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:39,330
kind of you know I very in-depth fully

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,990
thought-out kind of you know governance

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,660
model but it is way way better than the

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,370
complete lack of it so there is a formal

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,810
you know like a wiki page that describes

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,440
what you need to do to become a

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,180
committer how you merge etc so I think

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,500
it's very important that's what's

00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,640
happening I think that the next

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,320
happening is this needs to evolve

00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,940
further as people start contributing

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,020
there's gonna be a lot of edge questions

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,730
like you know if I you know I'm writing

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,920
a plug-in and I wrote a load of codes

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,830
can I merge that like there has to be

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,550
some kind of you know kinks worked out

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:17,120
along the way and I also think that you

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,370
know the next step would be for

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,540
spinnaker to be donated to some

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:26,820
foundation that can actually take it on

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,130
its own kind of independent path which

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,590
will actually help bring I think more

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,180
vendors that can take and then solve big

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,610
problems in the spinnaker community like

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,100
for example the lack of the plug-in

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,870
framework so you know like OpenStack

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,570
foundation or CN CF or

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:47,140
your foundation whatever it is I think

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:49,089
is gonna be a big important step towards

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,100
taking the Community Development to the

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:53,200
next level since Google is already

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,820
involved with this project and google

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,870
also has kubernetes and there are all

00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,910
these parallels drawn between

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,550
communities and it's been incremented I

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:04,990
can in queue note if anyone is becoming

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:11,380
so can you talk about that yeah yeah so

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:13,630
it's one of the things that of course

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,270
because kubernetes is like the hottest

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:20,710
thing since sliced bread now everybody

00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:23,339
wants kubernetes a lot of the greenfield

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:26,440
activities in the infrastructure space

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:32,320
are tied to kubernetes and the

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:34,029
kubernetes team is you know able to make

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,089
a lot of decisions on the influence the

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:38,589
direction right so if I'm going to cloud

00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:40,570
typically kubernetes is there because

00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:42,400
that's my way to do you know multi-cloud

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,990
with no welcome if I'm moving to

00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,680
containers Andrey Architects iam

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,720
applications

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,490
that's kubernetes is there if I'm trying

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,959
to adopt DevOps kubernetes is there

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,910
there's always a kubernetes team and

00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,700
that kubernetes team has a lot of

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,850
influence over what tools I use the

00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,270
spinnaker used is something else used in

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,220
the context of the overall initiative

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:06,130
and if you look at the you know a lot of

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,679
the talks that are happening today and

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:12,400
tomorrow as well as what the community

00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:14,260
is working on there's a lot of you know

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,449
a lot of work being done to make

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,429
spinnaker kubernetes friendly they have

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,589
the v1 provider now they just release

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:25,689
the v2 provider people are trying to use

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:28,300
it yadda yadda but I think that if you

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,450
go to a cube con and you talk to the

00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:34,960
kubernetes developers and you know very

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:37,660
few people have actually you know heard

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,880
of spinnaker or you know are choosing

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,070
proactively to use spinnaker

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,730
as you know their way to do continuous

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:49,130
delivery into kubernetes and the reason

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,450
for it is twofold one is

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,039
simply because of you know lack of the

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,250
marketing aspect it's not a part of a

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,340
foundation it's still kind of it's very

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,020
promising but smaller project that a lot

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,640
of people outside of us continuous

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,490
delivery domain such as a you know who

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,460
donate is people haven't heard about but

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,020
two very important layer is also the

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,320
fact that spinnaker was never really

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,770
built in my view with a developer in

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,500
mind it was built as a you know a tool

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:23,549
for the ops team to manage the delivery

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:28,260
process and you know in a you know

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:31,409
DevOps equation the dev part is kind of

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,929
caring more and more weight and I don't

00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:35,820
think about any tool any DevOps tool

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:38,010
we've continuous delivery tool or CI a

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,950
tool or whatever that wants to be a

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,049
player in the space can be exclusively

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,630
focused just on the ops it has to be

00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,130
also developer friendly and the way

00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,230
Spinnaker's built it it's pretty big

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,240
it's pretty heavy you know it takes some

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,460
effort to actually set it up and stall

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,590
it and if I'm a developer hiking on

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,409
kubernetes I'm not gonna go and you know

00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:01,350
take this you know big hunk of java code

00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:04,260
that a spinnaker and go set it up on you

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,520
know several VMs I can't it's even like

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,340
virtually impossible to set up on a

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,770
laptop alone right so I think that's

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,490
another important area for spinnaker

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:17,460
community to tackle right so if I think

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,919
it's absolutely important for spinnaker

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,100
to be irrelevant to you know kubernetes

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,039
developers and it's also completely

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,140
clear that you know in this current

00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,809
shape of form as this heavy java based

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,299
tool as a developer I'm not gonna go and

00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:35,490
like play around with it and then go and

00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:37,470
sell it to you know my boss and say oh

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,630
yeah that's the best tool to develop to

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,279
deploy on kubernetes and parallel

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,049
kubernetes is also actually deploying

00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,960
its native tools for doing kubernetes

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,899
deployments like you know there's a

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,090
kubernetes you know stateful sets

00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,890
there's a deployment object now or you

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,500
can actually define how the deployment

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,149
is done for kubernetes so like the

00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,260
kubernetes community is evolving and

00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:01,590
kind of you know building its own

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,710
kubernetes centric deployment patterns

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:08,550
I think that it's important that in the

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,170
next couple of years or a year spinnaker

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,870
really bridges into the kubernetes

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,300
community or at-risk scoober made is

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:19,340
evolving away on its own path and then

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,340
you know it's it's not going to be good

00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,880
