00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,010
hi this is a party and we are here the

00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:18,449
spinnaker summit in Seattle and today we

00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,769
have with us Steven Kim from Google

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,829
first of all thanks for coming to the

00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:25,929
show and can you tell us about what do

00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:29,259
you do at Google I'm an engineering

00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:31,479
manager at Google and I manage the

00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:35,110
spinnaker team at Google when did you

00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:40,480
get involved with the spinnaker got

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:45,250
involved in a year prior to the open

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,890
sourcing event so summer of 2015 and at

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,940
that point I think some other members of

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,350
the team had been involved in the

00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,640
spinnaker project for about a year prior

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:57,010
to that so today we are here in 2018 and

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,110
we have kind of officially the first

00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,930
spinnaker summit so how do you see the

00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,299
evolution of this particular community

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,240
yeah I think the I mean last year we had

00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,679
sort of you know ad-hoc we wouldn't

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,240
necessarily call it a summit I guess

00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:12,850
maybe it was more like a souped-up

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,009
meetup which is really big and

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,560
successful but year after year as a

00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:21,960
community gathers together it's a good

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:26,109
time to come heads up look around a bit

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,420
reflect on what we did in the recent

00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:29,560
past and what we need to focus on going

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,109
forward because there's a tremendous

00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,780
amount of signal that comes in with the

00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:37,799
opportunity to meet with the users and

00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,189
the community that's obviously growing

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,429
year after year and and when we look at

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:48,189
a spinnaker community first of all these

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,810
days almost all the you know I don't

00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,310
know whether you call product or product

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,069
no mostly no of your salon or open

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,630
source in the technologies so and Google

00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:59,079
has been involved with like project like

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,749
kubernetes so the new work on spinnaker

00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,969
and then you know we also some parallel

00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:06,969
drawn with kubernetes what have you

00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:09,180
learned from kubernetes community that

00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,130
you would like to kind of either

00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,210
implement in the spinnaker communities

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:19,230
so that it grows in a very net

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:22,200
yeah we actually reached out to the

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,720
communities team whom obviously being at

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,530
Google we work closely with anyway

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,090
but some of the key people who were

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,340
involved and really were at the genesis

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,720
and were involved in developing

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,940
establishing growing that open source

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,490
project in community we consulted them

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,190
heavily asked for some advice asked for

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,990
details and how they run their project

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,600
and lessons learned what's working well

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,940
what's not and obviously spinnaker is at

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,030
a different scale a much smaller scale

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,530
but we hope to be successful in the way

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,180
that they've been successful one

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,710
difference on the other hand is

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,500
criminais visas a project that is

00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,690
started at Google and bootstrap that

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,270
Google and and continues to be led by

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,280
Google predominantly although obviously

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,950
that's changing as the project grows

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,870
over there and spinnaker is is different

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,880
spinnaker is a project that started at

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,510
Netflix and then Google got involved

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,640
obviously very very very heavily and we

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,050
pushed that ball across the open source

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,760
line together and so I think that we

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,240
really benefited from that because we

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,510
sort of had a friend in arms that we

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,860
worked collectively with also Google

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,820
brought a different set of values to the

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:39,180
project then Netflix did Netflix being

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,710
the proving grounds for what spinnaker

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,360
is capable of doing obviously they did

00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,670
not have notoriety but that was that was

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,260
that was well deserved they did prove it

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,600
out inside their enterprise so they can

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,870
talk about tangible ways that spinnaker

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,140
benefits them and I have more perfect

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,850
vision into what they need to focus on

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,170
what's working on what's not and Google

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:02,700
brought the set of you know obviously

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,730
more programming and software

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,050
engineering and talent but also with the

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,610
lessons that we've learned internally as

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,140
well that we wanted to go in and bring

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:14,240
in there as well so it was really unique

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,230
relationship with multifaceted strengths

00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,040
that we were able to go to open source

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,320
together if you look at community it

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,060
already need a removal but now ciencia

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,500
this kind of slowly slowly gradually you

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,690
know

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,940
just recently Google donated like 9

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,320
million you know great credit also to

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,080
help the community to become more

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,040
independent so when we look at its

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,690
pinnacle committee what is your

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,340
long-term goal where you orders I mean

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,110
we already you know yesterday the

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,360
governess model was kind of announced so

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,540
what do you see where it will be going

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,040
as a community yeah I think it is an

00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,540
attempt at trying to be delivered about

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,900
what is necessary for the project to

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,810
continue to grow or and scale to tell

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,740
you the truth there were a lot of

00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,300
tactical things that I was thinking

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,990
about on the ground related to

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,090
governance things like simply

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,730
transparency and providing paths for

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,280
people who want to get involved I mean

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,680
not to go out and over speak the the

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,490
issue but you know with Netflix and

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,620
Google and Microsoft and AWS evolved you

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:22,010
know it may not be very apparent for

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,810
other users how they can jump in on the

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,390
rapidly evolving codebase how they can

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:30,620
go and participate in lend their opinion

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:32,510
on design and and and contribute to the

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,760
project both from a technical

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,260
contribution but also culturally and you

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,210
know and their needs and steer the

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,930
project in that way

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,600
and so since the open sourcing event at

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,479
the end of 2015

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,060
up until up until recently I think the

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:53,270
project and the way that Netflix and

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,080
Google were staring it evolved really

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,600
well I think and it was really built on

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,860
a relationship of trust and a good

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,660
working relationship between the two

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,890
organisations and to the team

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:10,010
specifically but we understand that we

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:12,919
need to scale this thing and so we need

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,530
to get major enterprises using spinnaker

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:18,020
on the steering committee we need to get

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,360
the other cloud providers and major

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,250
technology organizations involved

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,300
because they have ways that they're

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,640
gonna go ahead and contribute that

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,250
Google and Netflix are unable to see or

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,220
unable to go and do so so that's really

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:35,120
what we're trying to go and start with

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,349
governance and we don't know necessarily

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,120
the best way that this is going to play

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:40,460
out but we know that

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,060
the right first foot forward is to at

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,980
least codify it even if it's out the

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,169
gate what had been happening all along

00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,930
which is okay we're starting with

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:53,330
Netflix and Google on the seats but we

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,160
needed it to mark the transparency and

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,380
try to be deliberate about establishing

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,210
a path by which others can get involved

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,979
these kind of products and what they

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,930
come from you know develop personal it's

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,210
the whole developer community they are

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,740
working together you know so they want

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,139
to make a lot of decisions okay we have

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,050
to you know build a corner so the

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,639
decisions are made by the developer code

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,340
label or at the higher level the

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,470
leadership of the company yeah so we

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,760
have try to be thoughtful about this

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,410
really at the center of it we have the

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,500
technical oversight committee who are

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:32,510
really managing the project we're

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:35,960
talking about tactics like setting code

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:38,930
style guidelines to obviously important

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,850
things like reviewing major designs that

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:46,580
are that are important to the area to

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:49,610
the project and managing the lists of

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,080
people who have who hold the keys to get

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,510
commit and merge access into the

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,820
repositories and conveying that trust on

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,700
to individuals who are you know

00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,990
contributing members of the project they

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,740
are obviously not gonna have perfect

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:06,380
visibility into the breadth of areas

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,930
that spinnaker needs to work well in and

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,970
so we're hoping that we can we have also

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:14,539
opened up a clear way for special

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,970
interest groups to get started and that

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:19,820
they can focus on areas like CI

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,639
interactions or artifact handling or UI

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,830
UX now that gets done and I think for

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:29,180
example the way it's gonna happen is if

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,440
a another organization has a major chunk

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,990
of code they want to go in there to

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,150
spinnaker major feature the technical

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,339
oversight committee will largely defer I

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,380
would think to the respective special

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:41,029
interest group if one exists to go and

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,490
say that there is agreement over there

00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:45,410
about an approach in a design and what

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,240
they thought through and then the

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,690
technical oversight committee will then

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,520
go to review from

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,220
so from a local perspective of what

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,380
that's where I think for the project so

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,870
the dynamic I hope will be that the

00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,820
steering committee who's really only job

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,650
is to go to focus on the right structure

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,020
for the project that the needs are being

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,340
met that there's good balance and that

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,580
and the important needs are being

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,440
addressed will greenlight special

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,120
interest groups and say here's an area

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,550
to focus on can we go to get some people

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,470
thinking about this specifically and so

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,270
technical concerns as well as cultural

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,460
concerns you know obviously about things

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,620
like code of conduct you know a good

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,150
diverse in which a representation in the

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,420
community and things like that that's a

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,700
health of the project with that with

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,670
Technic looks like committee focusing on

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,840
the details of execution and a special

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,940
interest groups who are really leading

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,530
the focus going forward do you have

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,300
anybody concrete a structure for the

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,560
governance model that okay this is a

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,880
three tiers division with a technical

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,350
oversight committee we'll be there in a

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,340
steering committee will be there will be

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:52,260
there a boat here or yes so on the

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,870
spinner trial page on the website we

00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,410
have a page under community governance

00:09:53,870 --> 00:10:00,900
and we named a steering committee

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:03,690
comprised of five members three from

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,370
Netflix and two from Google who's once

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,350
again managing the structure of the

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,420
governance instructional project we

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,720
named the technical oversight committee

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,680
which is comprised of two members from

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,930
Google and to Netflix and then and then

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,420
also a structure by which you gain

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:24,740
access as an approver who has merged

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,390
access as a review of goes and lgt ends

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,130
for requests that are coming in and then

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,680
also what generally active community

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,810
members can do to be more involved and

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,420
contribute to the community and then

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,440
also we talked about the existing

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,390
special interest groups

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,410
I say plural but really there's one

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,970
right now which has been running which

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,550
is around kubernetes which is obviously

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,430
a very important aspect of this vinegar

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,140
project but there are many others that

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,000
I've been speaking to different people

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,560
that I think are important areas that I

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,560
feel like they should consider starting

00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:00,540
up a special interest group around yeah

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,520
right now you know it's mostly Google

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,080
and Netflix but going forward how do you

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,240
do you plan to ensure that it's more

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,370
inclusive you know at the steering

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,959
committee level or but also it also

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,570
depending on how many you know people I

00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,560
clean ball and that label also so how do

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,570
you plan to do that

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,860
yeah it's imperative that it grows and

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:22,589
changes the the governance model

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,589
launching with all seats and a Google

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:27,959
and Netflix is strictly a reflection of

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:29,700
how things had been so for the past two

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,709
years that's the way the project has

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,990
been led it's been by Netflix and Google

00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:35,610
on the ground trying to go ahead and do

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,770
the administrative work trying to go and

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,380
get the community rounding around

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,690
grouping up around special in important

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,130
areas so it's really a codification and

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,339
the documentation of how things are

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,660
yesterday and today but one of the first

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,930
orders of the steering committee for

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:55,350
example is going to be to figure out and

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,779
articulate the process by which how do

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,730
people get nominated to the technical

00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,080
IRB's that committee how many seats are

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,029
gonna have in this town committee that

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,190
happens to be fired right now for not of

00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,890
any particular good reason but we

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,589
absolutely want steering committee to

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,180
represent the major user community to

00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:14,399
help us focus and validate on the right

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,370
things for the technology vendors the

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,089
cloud providers technology organizations

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,589
so that's gonna be one of the first

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:21,630
things that we need to go and discuss so

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:24,750
right now on the website it'll simply

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:27,990
say everything relating to tenure and

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,579
nomination process whatever TBD

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,170
but that TBD is the first thing that

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,610
we're gonna go to my dress component is

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,529
is huge because its salt a different

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,370
problem a spinnaker is solving a

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:41,970
different problem but how do you really

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:43,440
plan to also engage more users this this

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,700
summit is a good example of you know

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,170
reaching out or bringing the community

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,690
together so how do you plan to actually

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,130
reach out to more people who could be

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,899
potential users or there may be a lot of

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:56,190
people who are using it but they don't

00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:59,430
know or you don't know them yeah and

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,950
growing that user base is imperative for

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,560
more than one reason the one that I

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,640
think about the most is there is no

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,350
shortage of organizations trying to

00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,560
solve this problem in this in this

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:15,910
continuous delivery

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,110
domaine what we focused on on the

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,710
spinnaker project what we think is

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:23,680
important and what a track record

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:25,270
hopefully has faithfully shown is almost

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,940
everything we put out there is validated

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:31,150
by actual enterprises running at scale

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,740
and prove it out so for example on the

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,470
Google team speaking for our team

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,300
there's very little that we do where we

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,000
don't have a customer waiting on the

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,310
other end of delivery we really don't

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,460
like putting out code where it's it's

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:48,040
stale for months and so throughout the

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,750
design process validating that the that

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,490
this would satisfy the requirement for

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,610
this particular area that the user is

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,710
working in and then upon release for

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,839
them to say oh yes it does work

00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,240
obviously things like flushing out bugs

00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,040
and hardening the code base which is

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,720
very important but also the iterative

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,089
process by which we say this was a

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
success or it wasn't if it wasn't

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,820
success how do we what one of the next

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,430
some you could have build on and so

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,660
forth so it's very important that's what

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,180
that's why it's very important to have

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,980
Netflix who was validating things

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,260
internally for Google to go to you so

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,400
and many of the large organizations so

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:26,160
it's very critical to get that done

00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,460
so far we've done near zero really to

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,850
market

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:35,110
we've August we had you know a small

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:37,690
number of tech write-ups you know we've

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,060
done interviews and so forth we've never

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,920
had a marketing campaign or anything

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,390
like that

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,830
and yet the organic growth has been

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:49,570
strong we really at a point where we are

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,330
struggling to scale with the user demand

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:56,610
that's out there and I think there's a

00:14:52,330 --> 00:15:01,570
high density of the user demand of

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,740
qualified users because we don't go out

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,920
and cast our nut and they're not very

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,060
far that the people who have come or

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,350
people who have found on their own

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,880
because they have they need they have

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,880
the intent and they're seriously

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,830
engaging on this thing that's a question

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,200
that kind of remains what are the things

00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,180
that we need to do right if we want to

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,390
go to do this

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,520
I was talking to some users here and

00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:29,190
most of them were like we have been

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:31,860
tracking it from those Asgar days you

00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,390
know when that makes our doing it so the

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,060
moment it was open source you know we

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,940
were like jumped into the bay so and we

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,589
are here this summit and not that you

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,870
know now you have been talking to a lot

00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,760
of users already what kind of trends you

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,940
have you are seeing where people are

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:52,980
adopting yeah over the last year we are

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:55,709
really seeing many organizations really

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,160
running spinner grass scale

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:01,830
so I'd say at last year's summit or

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,300
gathering it was sort of a speakeasy

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,010
gathering it was kind of by invitation

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,320
only we never broadcast it

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,270
friends of friends were pulled in and

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,620
people showed up and the kinds of

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,770
questions that people were had for an

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,560
exploratory or it was about installing

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,760
spinnaker and configuring spinnaker how

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,589
do I get this thing up and running and

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,050
get my first couple of teams running on

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:24,750
this thing is kind of where they were

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:27,570
this year certainly especially at the

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,750
event this week but eating up the past

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,970
couple of quarters the questions and the

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,610
issues that we see on the forums and on

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,490
slack are like rate-limiting issues

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,990
where with the platform because they're

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,110
running a scale they're hitting those

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:46,620
issues you know it's you know Redis

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,240
cache memory and performance issues and

00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,370
they need to have honeydew to distribute

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,620
the Redis back-end for example or a

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,600
cloud driver across read write and read

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,240
only modes and so outright only read

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,750
only modes and so forth and so we see

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,529
that scaling happening where the

00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,850
organisations who are adopting this are

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:05,069
doing it successfully and many

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,650
organizations are doing so and when you

00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,510
see these use cases you also see the

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,470
problem or challenges those customers

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:15,240
are not facing so how much how much of

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,589
that you know fixing comes from the

00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,280
customer versus you guys are trying to

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,420
do it yourself

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:24,329
typically the option of spinnaker looks

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,400
very much like an s-curve maybe you

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,919
might think that's typical but actually

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,639
with developer tooling the adoption

00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:33,580
curve

00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:36,220
for tools is typically more linear so

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,820
one team adopts it it takes an increment

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,499
of work

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,019
second team adopts it takes another

00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:44,200
increment of work 100th team adopts it

00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:46,059
it takes 100x to go to get to that point

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,409
everybody's wrangling their own they're

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,850
figuring out the problem over and over

00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:51,100
and over again in a very distributed

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,200
fashion the spindle adoption pattern is

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,850
much more centralized typically it is a

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,399
little more deliberate and it's

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,409
certainly a slower out the gate because

00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:02,519
it's more centrally oriented but the

00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:05,590
scaling at some point goes like this

00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,960
where they really hit their stride and

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:12,179
all of a sudden it goes from one team

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:15,539
adopting to five to all 750 and then

00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:18,429
hundreds that are adopting it with a

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:20,590
decreasing rate of problems and

00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,940
questions and how do we do these things

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,399
and they come to a point where they hit

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,769
maturity rather quickly and then they

00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:28,029
hit regular mini shoes and caching

00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,470
issues and things like that but those

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:31,659
are technical challenges of scaling

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,159
which are solvable in different ways so

00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:34,869
ok let's let's stop talking technology

00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,429
for a while and let's talk about you

00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:40,419
what are you doing your free time what

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:43,269
do you do for fun stuff oh boy I like

00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:47,470
personally uh-huh I have four children

00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:49,269
uh-huh who in a given point in time at

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:54,850
least one or more children could use

00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:56,320
more time from me so there's always more

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,110
investing enough time I can do over

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,639
there I have to preserve my own sanity

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:05,919
so exercise regiment I've been doing a

00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:08,980
lot of going back into martial arts

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,869
again which it's not about me breaking

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,970
things for getting out of Gresham it

00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:17,799
really is a lot of good cardio and good

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:19,559
exercise and then sometimes I do you

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,820
know programming projects on the side

00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,379
for fun but I always see nothing that I

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,720
can sustain over months or anything like

00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:26,110
that oh and I play video games with the

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,610
kids

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,919
Oh what kind of games you play I play I

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,869
play overwatch I'm an overwatch

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,890
competitive junky I can't play with the

00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:39,499
kids who are better players than I am

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,490
but

00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:43,889
thank you so much for talking to me

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,200
today of course and we'll see you at the

00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:48,509
next conference yeah that's big it's

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,030
been a great summit bid 1,000 users have

00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:58,470
definitely

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:58,470
