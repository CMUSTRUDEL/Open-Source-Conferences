00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,520
so today we are going to talk about not

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,400
the technology for a spinnaker but

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,230
people proud of it when you look at

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,840
people I am soccer hockey I'm a tech

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,320
journalist journalism is becoming kind

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,420
of I think endangered species but I

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,460
understand surviving but we have a

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,530
little panel which is kind of building a

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,300
future right so let's start from the far

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,700
right or left what is that I'm not

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,590
political one direction should I

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,410
introduce myself yes please all right hi

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,289
everyone my name is Lolita enochian I am

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,329
I work for a start-up called pubertus

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,570
where we build fit financial

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,640
applications for applications for

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,910
financial institutions that means mostly

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,030
banks that help weed fight basically

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,159
engagement of their customers I am the

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,740
director of tools equality which means

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,900
everything that deals with continuous

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,900
integration and deployment as well as

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,360
the tooling in quality testing

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,360
automation prior to this I was with

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,860
Netflix for five years where I was on

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
the client side I didn't work directly

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,080
with the spinnaker team in but I

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,220
witnessed the adoption of spinnaker on

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,009
on our team like all the browser browser

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,930
player team prior to that I was at

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,729
Microsoft a number of startups before

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,729
that always in tech rose

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,300
and my name is Rajesh okay and I work

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,430
for Capital One I'm a director of

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,950
engineering for the cloud platform and

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,040
change and spinnaker is one of the

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,940
product my team supports and everything

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,050
related to cloud journey and enabling

00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,450
continuous integration and continuous

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,750
deployment infrastructure provisioning

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,080
chaos engineering all those things fall

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,180
under my to mine and prior to that I was

00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,950
working for Walmart technology and

00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,870
taking care of their integrations of

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,800
brick and mortar and as well as

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,920
e-commerce airspace my name is Andrew

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,230
Backus I'm with armory and we provide

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,720
products and services that are built on

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,030
top of spinnaker and one of the things

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
I'll be able to talk to today is we have

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,010
a wide arrange a wide range of customers

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,930
that vary in sizes so I'm going to be

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,820
able to share that perspective from you

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,740
know their journey becoming successful

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,240
spinnaker let's start from you first up

00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,510
can you just share you know that how you

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,459
are using spinnaker in what capacity so

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,320
I have two stories essentially to share

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,300
first was at Netflix like we were a

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,480
client team so we didn't take it

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,810
initially and did Thomas actually had an

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,420
amazing slide to show how things were

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,510
just or the browser player team was the

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,830
spinnaker was adapted how seamlessly the

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,510
deployments went and that's one one area

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,090
and then the second one is at the

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,629
startup so we are partnering with our

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,489
dream to onboard spinnaker and

00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:22,859
we are still in the development stage

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:25,260
but our goal is to reduce the time that

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,599
it takes to deploy and improve the

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,590
improve the quality of deployment in

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:35,969
we're in financial sectors so like

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:40,260
downtime means a lot of loss so we want

00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:42,239
to get to zero downtime basically green

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:52,079
blue blue blue green or red like

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:54,329
deployments as soon as possible yeah we

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,569
have been using spinnaker in capital man

00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,450
for for more than two years now and we

00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,700
customized it based on how we have to do

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,129
audit trail because we are also filter

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,040
company and we customized the deck

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:11,189
portion of it just provide a new UI for

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,459
our own users and the size of adoption

00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:17,160
is growing up to like two years ago

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,989
until two years ago we have hundreds of

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,539
pipelines across capital one because

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,580
some innovation was really really

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,220
incentivized and everyone came up with

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,919
their own solution for a common problem

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:34,349
and cloud migration was also at the peak

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:36,870
at that time now we know that you have

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,550
to maintain it and support it not just

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,389
in a rate right and then it's all

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,430
hitting hard on the teams now we are all

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,470
consulted in the consolidation mode so

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,750
right now we have four solutions

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,419
identified across Capital One and

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,880
spinnaker is one of them so across the

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,520
shared tech line of business spinnaker

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,710
is the adopted - solution and our

00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,070
customized version is called cloud burn

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,430
you

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,080
we shortly called a Tesco and we are

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,229
talking about a hundred to two hundred

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,420
teams adopting two spinnaker and fifty

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:14,490
teams are automatically deploying to

00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,490
correction through spin encrypted a

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,790
because we wanted to grab if you wanted

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,070
to add some capital one specific

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,470
information to it like how we are

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,650
managing application and how these

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,570
applications are tied to the business

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,420
functionalities and all those

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,610
informations needs to be captured and

00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,580
for audit trails so that is that is one

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,110
of the reasons but actual pipeline

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,680
orchestration is powered by spinnaker

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,730
and even the UI of how you view pipeline

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,280
execution is all spin a turbine based

00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:57,070
I'd say that our average customer is

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,610
around deploying somewhere around 100

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,010
applications so you know 80 you to 150

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,030
ish range and they usually have

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:10,420
somewhere a little under a hundred users

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:12,700
on the on the platform we also have I

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,410
guess some on the other spectrum side of

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,180
the spectrum we have some some teams

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,120
that are very small six to ten people

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:23,080
and then we have the most extreme in the

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,540
thousands so can also talk about you

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,490
know how is you want the team structure

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,050
and how they interact with them so

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,240
spinnaker game is Maegan independently

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,690
or is the spirit goes down

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,020
so usually what we've seen work the best

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,759
is when an organization has a platform

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,169
team I mean they call it different

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,509
things that sometimes I call it DevOps

00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,479
sometimes platform seems to be the most

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:50,020
common one right now sometimes I still

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,699
call it an ops team and then from there

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,620
you have application teams that are

00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,330
broken up and that that's the most

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,910
common structure I think that we've seen

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,910
so when you embrace vinegar

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:12,740
oh sorry sorry Mike you know chose to

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,810
embrace what was the reason why you

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,080
chose it I think I want to give the

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:21,770
panelists a also a chance to answer okay

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,890
okay cool what was the question why do

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,230
we choose spinnaker so it is it is

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:31,430
interesting what what we're seeing more

00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:33,950
and more is that CD has become a real

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,230
market now I'd say two years ago this

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,800
wasn't the case but we've seen more and

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:42,650
more customers coming to us and saying

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,340
hey we're gonna do C CD and we're

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:48,380
evaluating these three solutions we want

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,750
to engage with you and that's really

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,820
interesting we don't that's new that I

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,930
think that's started in the last six

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,670
months so they make it usually what how

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,820
they make the decision is they have a

00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,860
matrix a decision making matrix and in

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,150
there they have weighted values for

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,510
different things so this is probably

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,310
common format for most people but one

00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,670
thing that I was really surprised about

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,040
is that open source is always on there

00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,250
and it's weighted a lot heavier than I

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,870
ever thought it was so it's it's almost

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,580
like we could lose out on all the other

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,160
columns and just because we're open

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,530
source they're gonna want to move it

00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,540
forward and that is that's brand-new and

00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,860
that is not something we'd seen before

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,860
so what was the

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,440
along with the same reasons that Andrew

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,389
mention yes the CD portion of it and as

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,159
well as be very heavily investing on

00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:44,779
open source product if there is a

00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,000
solution out there we don't want to

00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,160
leave and the solution right now and the

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,050
orchestration capability of spinnaker is

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,860
something that was very interesting and

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:57,860
it is also CI tool agnostic where if

00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,170
Jenkins is not the only CI told that it

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,930
supports any bill script anything that

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,209
that the team can bring in we should be

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:09,050
we would be able to orchestrate right

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:11,690
based on considering the the number of

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,089
platforms and and the technology across

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,940
Capital One this seem to be an obvious

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:20,839
choice for us rather than just banking

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:23,959
on one CA tool and adding CD capability

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:28,130
to it and what kind of is it like a CD

00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:31,040
TM yeah ours is is one team that is

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:34,510
supporting spinnaker both capability

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,130
development and as well as adoption and

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,370
supporting our clients to on hold the

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:44,449
spinnaker providing support but we are

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:47,260
trying to expand it we also are very big

00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:49,850
give importance to inner sourcing

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,620
opportunities as well it's like another

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,500
team if they have another implementation

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,100
that currently our team does not support

00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,079
they are very appreciated to bring in

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,800
that capability and contribute it back

00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:06,019
to Co our Arsenal spinnaker so that is

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,569
how we are managing not being the

00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:11,389
bottleneck if someone asks for some

00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:13,519
implementation of it they they are free

00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:15,740
to add that capability back to our

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,560
solution how big is the team

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,569
it's our five engineers at this point of

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,940
time I have talked a lot of your Boston

00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:26,010
cases they're like five engineer second

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,200
yeah there is an agile team

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:32,490
they dedicated the spinnaker and

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,030
supporting yeah so in your case what was

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,460
the reason why you embraced is vinegar

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:41,300
yeah so it's really interesting Roger

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,980
and I are very different spectrums right

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,550
Capital One is a huge establishment and

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,950
we are a 40-person startup so for us it

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,320
it is the question is if there is a

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:55,740
solution out there we want to adapt it

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,900
because we don't have the manpower and

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,550
the time to write it on our own and it

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,920
will make much sense so that's why we

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,410
chose basically some of the tooling that

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,470
we did for example we didn't choose

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,780
genders at the time we went for circle

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,140
see is our continuous integration tool

00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,000
it was rich in it works which a

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:22,110
spinnaker it doesn't have to go to

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,460
junkies but we're looking into moving to

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,300
Jenkins there

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:32,010
why spinnaker because of the issues we

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:34,320
had with basically not having enough

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,070
automation in our deployments and we

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,030
wanted to get there and instead of

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,130
freaking on board a huge team of

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,920
operations we decided to invest in the

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:51,540
technology ask me how big is the team

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:53,160
thank you yeah less than one person when

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,090
they told you to embracing its maker

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,370
what was the biggest challenge

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,370
technology or people in your case

00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:04,619
both are challenging I think in our case

00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:07,139
I'd say people was less of a challenge

00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:08,939
it was more of getting the buy-in to you

00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,860
from the technology leadership that we

00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:13,019
are going to pursue this tool and then

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,459
it was the technology to actually go and

00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:20,160
find the best like resources and that's

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:25,049
where armor came in and to actually go

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,600
and implement it a new case culture was

00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:30,660
a technology which was done and just

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,559
very similar to what limit mentioned

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,749
it's it's export it's convincing people

00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,329
as I mentioned there were hundreds of

00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:42,540
other pipeline solutions and convincing

00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:44,850
them they were very much attached to

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,980
their own babies right it's like oh I

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,779
don't want to I already have a solution

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,129
that works I'm already using it to

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,980
automatically deploy it to production

00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:56,069
why would I come to your why would I

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,739
adopt spinnaker I'm so convincing them

00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:01,529
it's both we had to do it both at the

00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:03,720
grassroot level using every venue that

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:06,329
is available to us within Capital One

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,939
workshops labs Tech Talks and everything

00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:12,389
and going in out there and showing

00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:15,209
demoing our product and also at the top

00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:17,100
top-down approach we had to go in and

00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:20,249
convince our leader so that they can

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,910
convince their own teams to to start

00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:26,279
migrating to spinnaker so when they come

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:30,389
to the top leadership personhood which

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:33,149
was the hard to convince the the

00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,980
grassroot level was harder because they

00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,190
know

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,680
that that their solution is working for

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,630
their need at that point of time and

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,240
they were very very very much attached

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:47,120
to their solution so convincing them

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,950
even even with the top-down approach it

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,830
took some time for the leaders to

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,320
convince their own teams to write so but

00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:57,830
but it is all good discussions that it

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,330
helped this one objectively look at

00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,120
whether this is the right solution for

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,860
Capital One and even add on top of it

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,290
what are the functionalities that we

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,480
need specifically from a compliance

00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,600
standpoint for a FinTech company and

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,400
then contribute it back right so those

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,260
are all really good discussions even

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,220
though it was hard at that point of time

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:21,650
to have and and be are chosen as the

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,320
pipeline of choice for the entire shape

00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,850
tech after that it in your case also

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,020
which was the harder to convince the

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:39,920
leadership for the Russell delivers

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:42,110
we are so small the nipple yeah I mean

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,330
the armory is an object so what was the

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:48,250
big challenge technology or people then

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:51,170
yeah so whenever we we engage with a new

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,510
customer site we like to think there are

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,180
three pieces people process and

00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,910
technology and we bring the technology

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,010
so there that that we like to think is

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:04,430
solid time and then we and then the

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:06,890
people in the process we we work with

00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,930
the organization to nail that and that

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,920
is the most challenging point is the

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,130
people in the process

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,690
the so at this point we kind of provide

00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:20,150
a playbook to help a company you know

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,380
migrate their organization and but to

00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:25,760
answer your question it's usually the

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:28,310
people and and four year old developers

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,890
there are like either you build Garvin's

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,960
or you Bill Gates so what is there for

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,310
stairs so that they can go maybe eight

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,310
while they have some restrictions

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:43,420
I guess a combination of both I think

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:46,570
more often we talked about guardrails

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,980
but sometimes it also depends on the

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,540
shape of your organization what you're

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,040
trying to accomplish if your

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,830
organization is trying to migrate from

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,750
ec2 to kubernetes for example at one

00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,960
point you know it's done with guardrails

00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:01,600
and then eventually it's cut off you

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,790
can't deploy to ec2 anymore so it

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,000
depends on what you're trying to what

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,350
your agenda is within the organ run in

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,420
your case how do you enable your

00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,820
developers to have flexibility as well

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,820
as freedom freedom so Guardian versus

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:22,960
our warn developers who support

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:26,350
spinnaker is that the question yeah yeah

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,140
there is not a lot of restriction around

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,140
it and they are very free to explore any

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,779
new technologies anything play with that

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,660
and and and most of the time our

00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:40,420
requirements come from our own

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,150
developers right the developers who want

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:46,480
to use or who don't want to use and they

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:50,800
have a specific reason why then so we

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,110
are very free to to navigate and and

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,269
explore what technology is out there

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,589
get back but freedom you know you also

00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:00,230
have some accountability

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:02,899
you cannot just move you look everything

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,220
how do you manage that as well that they

00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,929
have the freedom things you don't play

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,439
with it at the same time they have some

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:11,689
accountability I mean when you say

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,110
accountability it's very interesting

00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:20,780
right at the end of the day what risks

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:24,850
we produce and are we complained and are

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:28,520
we meeting our end goals as long as that

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:31,190
is met and that that actually provides

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:35,690
your guardrails for not going beyond

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:38,000
from exploring solutions aspect there

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,400
there are some things that our open

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,380
source office makes sure that we are not

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,690
bringing in any solution that does not

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,190
fall and there's some specific licensing

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,410
requirements those are all the things

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,900
that are already in place based on

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,809
because of the the type of company and

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,720
type of Industry we operate on so we

00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:59,480
don't have to specifically device any

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,510
new guardrails for that we do have

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,150
systems that we can rely on and they

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:09,260
make sure that we are not falling out of

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:14,090
our line but beyond that we don't really

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:16,520
respect our teams to to bring in

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,400
and your case is kind of unique because

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:25,400
a smaller team so what what what kind of

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:27,230
you know processes you have Italy - yeah

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,330
for me it was an interesting transition

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,730
Netflix is the biggest believer in

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,890
freedom and responsibility right sort of

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,990
the paraphrase of this in coming to

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,180
startup although it's a start-up we are

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,090
still in the FinTech so it's regulated

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,820
and everything has to be complied so in

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:46,550
some ways just because of those

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,520
regulations developers cannot just go

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:53,300
and deploy at any point of time there

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:57,020
have to be for certain systems the

00:18:53,300 --> 00:19:02,320
access is limited to let a few people or

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:05,660
operations but to the extent possible we

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:11,429
empower the engineers to make decisions

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:13,499
in provide the tools to to be successful

00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:16,859
I have an interesting story to tell

00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:18,659
about spinnaker and Netflix from the

00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,719
side that you don't usually hear it's

00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:24,089
from the client-side because since

00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:26,909
Netflix was such a big believer about in

00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:29,369
freedom and take responsibility right so

00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:31,499
there is no enforcement of all the teams

00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:34,109
have to use spinnaker starting next year

00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:36,509
if you want to use the jenkees machine

00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:38,879
that other is under your desk you can

00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,339
continue doing it as long as you are

00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:44,339
accountable to maintain it and upgrade

00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:46,379
it so that if your team needs to push

00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:48,330
something it's available and for some

00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:49,950
products actually we chose to do it for

00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,979
some legacy product which was not to

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:57,450
migrate for example our Silverlight if

00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:59,639
anybody remembers a Windows Phone

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,809
application we chose not to upgrade

00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:06,659
anything it hit keep the net player the

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:10,289
box under my desk until we moved into

00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:13,559
the level but it was again not an

00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:15,839
enforcement but basically providing the

00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,349
team's information of hey we have these

00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,460
cool tools that will take care of those

00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:22,799
enormous efforts that you're trying to

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,789
solve on on your own and just you have

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,440
to pay the tax f adoption sure your

00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:31,259
velocity is going going to slow down

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,570
while you're onboarding this but after

00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,830
that you'll be able to release as much

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,379
as you want you will be able to

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:40,130
automatically canary and roll back which

00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:41,990
was a big pain otherwise

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,419
and to touch upon that point inner

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,330
stores and and you talk about open

00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:49,490
source so it's the internal culture

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,190
within capital the one you're embracing

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,850
a lot of open source technologies did it

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:58,340
kind of change your internal culture

00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:02,990
yeah absolutely right from an inner

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:05,840
sourcing standpoint because our even

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:10,130
though it is such a big organization and

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,890
we all operate in in silo to some extent

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:15,890
right but that is there is supplicant to

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:19,340
any big organization out there the one

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,650
thing that connects all of those things

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,690
this is the contribution and the

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:29,360
connectivity between the teams there are

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:31,820
multiple reasons to it one if I develop

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,270
something that I actually get attached

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,549
to the solution and and I am very proud

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,909
of supporting that solution as well that

00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:45,650
is that is a developer mindset and using

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:48,289
that and harvesting that into enhance an

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:51,049
existing product that is a big win for

00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:53,659
both the product owner and as well as

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:57,980
the the team who contributes back and

00:21:53,659 --> 00:22:00,650
Capital One incentivizes this very

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,710
heavily and we even developed a product

00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:07,400
called cultural that tracks all these

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,440
products that gets contributed from

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,409
different teams and who is contributing

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,230
it how much of their because this this

00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:17,630
Jason is in part of most of the time

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:20,780
this contribution is smart not part of

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,820
their desk regular job right they get

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,770
interested in some technology and they

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,750
don't get to work on the technology in

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,810
their current product so they actually

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,100
used

00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:34,440
time to contribute back to that to that

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:39,480
other product so these are all the

00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:44,160
things that connect the the developers

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:46,590
across the organization and also expose

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,230
lot of other capabilities and

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,140
opportunities for the developers within

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,350
the company so how do you incentivize a

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,870
team or individuals it is all individual

00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:01,530
intensification and and I had one

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:04,770
product that we are the architecting but

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:07,620
I had only one developer there are 26

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:11,370
contributors on that product and many

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:14,280
teams use that that one too so that is

00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:16,230
one example of even you don't have the

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,870
right resource in under your own

00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:21,120
organization you will be able to not

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:24,060
only develop and support that product

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,840
through contributions inner sourcing is

00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,840
across all

00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:34,809
all the companies so in your context

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:38,380
alone that's a nurse or something makes

00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:40,690
sense because yeah so it's a internally

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,779
for armories developers it's always a

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,450
battle to figure out what should be open

00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:48,700
sourcing what should not the default we

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,409
really want to do is have everything be

00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,870
open source but at the same time we need

00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:55,570
to create a reason for you know other

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,220
other businesses to engage with us so

00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,990
it's been interesting we've tried a few

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,630
different patterns to try and figure out

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:03,159
something that works I think Alex over

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,519
lunch talked a little bit about what

00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,830
we're trying right now and I think we've

00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,330
landed here by consulting with other

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,919
people other companies that have been

00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:17,380
successful in similar situations but it

00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,960
is interesting art all of our engineers

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,840
want everything to be open source so

00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,840
it's and I it's easier to it's way

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,779
easier to open-source keep like trying

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,940
to separate it it's it's actually it's

00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:32,049
so much overhead if you have a something

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,240
that you think is going to take a week

00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:37,690
it's gonna take three weeks like it's

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,789
it's so much more work but on customer

00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,429
sites I've gotten see some really

00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:45,250
interesting behavior due to open source

00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:47,440
so I was surprised to learn that some

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,679
companies banned their employees from

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,720
contributing to open source so that it's

00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:54,419
interesting what happens there they

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,710
basically have to funnel it through us

00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,570
so they're still doing the work and then

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,909
we're just helping them get it merged

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,980
and that was that was new didn't know

00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,720
that existed in the world and then the

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,809
the other on the other side of the

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,389
spectrum we have companies that are

00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:13,000
contributing massive amounts to the open

00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:15,130
source project and then usually in the

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,950
middle we have some some companies that

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,929
are just putting some patches here and

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:23,919
there for things that are affecting them

00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:26,740
and the theme that I've seen throughout

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,929
is that contributing to open source gets

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,580
people excited it's something they want

00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:32,950
to do there

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,260
and I think that's very encouraging I've

00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,640
really enjoyed watching that but when it

00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,740
comes to contributing to a vessel I

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,540
think there are three one is legal get

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,980
involved upwards that lever wants

00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,050
everything to be open source and they're

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,320
the business units they may or may not

00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:51,190
see any sense of open sourcing so which

00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:54,190
one plays water so I guess in in the

00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:57,520
case of armoury itself the way we think

00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,040
about it is you know we want to grow the

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,960
spinnaker user base even if they aren't

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,900
working with us directly like we want to

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,040
grow a whole community and that's our

00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:11,200
motivation for for doing open source so

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,760
I mean I guess if you look at big open

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,640
source projects you know you look at

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,890
Cassandra you look at my sequel there's

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,500
always a certain percentage of the big

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:23,110
pie that needs help and would come to us

00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,700
if you know in this analogy and so if we

00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,250
make them you know if we help everybody

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,160
and we just make it bigger then you know

00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,880
it'll pay for itself and we can get the

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,880
relationship working like that

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,140
and in your case is startled so is there

00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,700
anything in their souls at all because

00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:43,710
everybody is working very closely

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:46,830
together yeah absolutely so because of

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,720
the size of a lot of our projects get

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,670
contribute to it across teams of course

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:57,450
to get the best quality shipped sooner

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:59,010
so yeah in the terms of open sourcing I

00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,080
think there is a huge advantage to

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,670
individual developers as well right this

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,380
is something that they will be proud of

00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:09,990
they will get quality feedback on by the

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:13,350
moderators of that project or community

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:16,500
and then it's an amazing thing to also

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:19,080
showcase on your portfolio to show your

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,960
github projects and wherever those are

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,450
posted to to showcase what you

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,680
contribute it to so how do you decide

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,630
you know that do you keep everything

00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,960
open source so you decide some pieces to

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:33,420
go open source and proprietary we

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,910
haven't really open sourced in the

00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:39,180
startup but I think it would have to go

00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:41,700
up urgently to illegal to decide what

00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,910
what is proprietary and what can be

00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,950
shared with the community so there there

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:50,280
is a process to go through it every

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:52,590
company before before you can open it up

00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:56,390
but that's definitely the best way to

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:58,429
get the adoption up and to get also

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,440
contributors from

00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:02,799
from across the community to improve the

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,779
quality of your tool and the popularity

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,779
and in terms of capital one how much are

00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:10,549
you open sourcing north how do you make

00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:13,220
a decision to open source of choice and

00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:15,769
again our open source office and legal

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:19,340
plays a major role when we decide to

00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:22,340
open source and when it is time to get

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:25,220
back to the community but Capital One

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,990
supports open sourcing a high GI is one

00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,240
of the tools that is developed in-house

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,119
that cloud custodian is also another

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,929
tool that we developed in thousand it is

00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,809
getting over source now so it's all

00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:41,509
about the capacity and as well as legal

00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:44,090
and open source office helping us with

00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:46,249
the process do do business teams also

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,529
get involved that this makes a lot of

00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:50,509
strategic sense for us to open source

00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:52,190
this piece and build an ecosystem yes if

00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:54,110
there are business functionalities that

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,440
are used that can be used by other

00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:00,440
financial technologies and banking and I

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,830
know identity is one other space where

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,899
Capital One is also it's a it's more

00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,539
than open source is also productizing

00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:09,889
that identity software and that is

00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:12,970
something that they are interested in

00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:16,389
and working towards excellent and

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,389
community armory

00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,690
it's a spinnaker is a big I mean growing

00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:25,140
community and you interact with a lot of

00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,730
users some and also players which can be

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,250
your competitors so what kind of

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,360
collaboration is going in this community

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,570
in top

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,519
I think the the way that it kind of is

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:38,529
working right now is there's usually an

00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,799
initiative that's being ran by either

00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:43,929
Netflix or Google and then other players

00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,330
in the community help and all of the big

00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:48,279
big things are usually done by those two

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:52,019
companies and then there are smaller

00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:55,360
things that are headed up you know by

00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:57,249
someone in the community but most of the

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,989
big things are ran through through

00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:00,730
Netflix and Google I think there's only

00:29:58,989 --> 00:30:05,379
one special interest group right now

00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:07,059
which is a kubernetes v2 but I think

00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:09,220
we're gonna try and get more those

00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:11,739
special interest groups going and I

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:16,559
think that'll be a great facilitator to

00:30:11,739 --> 00:30:16,559
to grow that what do you think about

00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:25,000
evolution of it's exciting and one of

00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:27,010
the other reasons we went to the

00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,110
spinnaker is is the amount of

00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,179
contribution and the amount of support

00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,970
from the community that this product

00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:36,820
gets rather than a licensed product

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,100
where we have to rely on one vendor to

00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,880
and then work on a ticket with them and

00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,720
then have wait for them to to give us a

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,850
salvation

00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:50,169
right and it is really really exciting

00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:52,840
to be part of this this journey now one

00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:55,419
thing that from capital when we my team

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,940
and I were talking that we want to do

00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:00,580
more is contributing back we have so far

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,830
being the users of spinnaker we have

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:06,669
made some enhancements and

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:09,730
customizations that that can be used by

00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:11,169
other folks out there so we want to

00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,370
contribute back that is something that

00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,370
we will be working on

00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:21,270
do you have

00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:23,990
we are actively using the slack channels

00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:27,180
vinegars like an armory slack and

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,680
basically here we are witnessing how

00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,430
much the community has grown year over

00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,620
year right

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:34,560
last year 200 people at Netflix and

00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,210
today we have almost twice that size and

00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,520
it's gonna continue growing so it's

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,760
really great to be behind something that

00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:44,280
is on this emerging growth path and you

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,080
know it's going to be it's becoming even

00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,630
bigger but rather than a proprietary

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,850
solution as you mentioned yeah and I

00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,310
think like open source or not every

00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:57,690
company chooses what their competitive

00:31:53,310 --> 00:32:00,110
advantages what they can end what what

00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:03,780
is it that they can share right that's

00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:07,130
in a continuous delivery is something

00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:10,820
that can be brought back to community

00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:14,279
another example I have on this was about

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:16,759
improving the testing quality and

00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:20,009
basically integration testing quality

00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:24,059
Google shared their platform that versa

00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:26,609
for like Lake detections and just

00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:28,109
improving that quality in that was

00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:29,759
something that we also thought about

00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:32,009
that Netflix long at heart

00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,929
is there something that we are competing

00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:35,820
with or is this something that we can

00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:37,289
basically take back our learnings to the

00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,859
community and of course it's the later

00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,229
right

00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:44,460
that's not your advantage so why not

00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:45,330
share it save it to a CD and then that

00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,399
leads to the second phase

00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:50,179
cross-pollination when you need a lot of

00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:54,989
other user or service how does that work

00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:56,549
because so many different ideas and then

00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:57,629
also it's not just one is spinnaker

00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:59,279
there are a lot of other open-source

00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:01,109
products then you have to rely on the

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,059
Jews so can you just reflect on how does

00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:04,789
it help you know being an open source or

00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,899
like it help you know sharing ideas

00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:08,969
collaborating and cross-pollination

00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:11,879
yeah absolutely events like this are

00:33:08,969 --> 00:33:14,580
reached I think they are not just great

00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:18,809
for us as users to listen but also for

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:20,489
the Netflix and Google who are active

00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:22,799
leaders right in the space today to

00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:26,309
listen to us and see where our pain

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,440
points are in take those back in work on

00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:30,509
those assuming then it doesn't come

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,899
whole from the open source like I would

00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:35,879
love to be able to deploy our mobile

00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:38,099
applications through spinnaker there is

00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:39,610
not there today maybe next year we'll be

00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:49,480
talking about it

00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:54,760
to the Playstore in app store and can

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,590
you reflect on the pollination because

00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,840
you're doing a lot of open source work

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,450
consuming a lot of and you're also

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,670
trying to be on board continued and as

00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:08,050
you were yeah so how do you benefit you

00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:10,420
know with the projects even your

00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:13,600
competitors yeah absolutely the the

00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,340
implementation is something very

00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,790
different even though we are all using

00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:21,520
spinnaker how we implement spinnaker in

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:24,040
in our infrastructure may be different

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,220
from someone else right so how we can

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,650
find the optimal path to scale ten times

00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,990
twenty times for more adoption is it

00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:35,440
something that I was talking to Robert

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:37,990
from AWS this morning so these ideas

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,630
even though these are all like not huge

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:43,570
in monument and mountain mover at this

00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:45,880
point of time but those are all constant

00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,490
things that are back in the back of your

00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:51,190
mind to provide stability to provide

00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:53,170
support and how another company is

00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:56,020
approaching the same problem that I am

00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:58,240
dealing with not not only from a

00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:01,840
technology standpoint from a process

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,610
standpoint from from the culture

00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,550
standpoint that this is a really great

00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:09,520
forum for us to talk about and

00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:11,650
I swap ideas based on what works for

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,110
them what word does not work for them

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,740
and what is in your case another

00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:21,720
solution so the you mentioned other

00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:25,000
open-source projects and I think

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,650
spinnaker to be wildly successful is

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,970
going to have to address how it is going

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,750
to interact with some of these other

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,940
very popular open-source projects right

00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:37,480
now it's very clear that all of the

00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:40,000
Hoshi Corp toolchain so you know Falls

00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,330
tariffs on all of these we have to

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,970
figure out how to how to make it work

00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,950
very well as spinnaker and right now

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,720
there's confusion about are they

00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:53,170
competing it's been occurred competing

00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,390
against terraform and you know in a

00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:57,610
small sensor is an overlap but in a

00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,380
bigger sense there's not so you can

00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:03,010
there's still a lot you can do with both

00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,720
tools and any major organization now is

00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,000
going to have a solution that does

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,020
something like what terraform does as

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,360
well as orchestration spinnaker so that

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,940
one is very much on on my radar and

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,850
there are many more many more tools that

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,130
I think we need to think seriously about

00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,560
how to connect to spinnaker what they're

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,850
talking about the tools involved they

00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,620
also sometimes draw parallel disk

00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,570
abilities because Google is involved in

00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,730
both the project and it has become you

00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,830
know an overnight success and the case

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,780
of the spinnaker what could be the

00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,220
factor is that it was already a project

00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,410
that we use internally it was not

00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,510
created ground-up just threw at the

00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,420
users and see you know what will work so

00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:45,040
what has contributed to the success and

00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,280
adoption of a spinnaker where everybody

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,830
is like happily using it cancer

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:55,480
it's a good question I think the way I

00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:57,190
think about it is I want more use so so

00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,270
I'm thinking about ways to make it more

00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:03,550
popular some things that come to mind

00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:06,280
are meetups in areas more than just the

00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,840
Bay Area so I think we have meetups in

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,000
San Francisco and South Bay

00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,690
but why not have them all across the

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,590
world just to raise awareness in general

00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:18,970
about around the project there are

00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,920
probably a lot of other things we can do

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,260
but growing the community even if they

00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,690
aren't contributors just users growing

00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:28,840
the user base what would really help

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:32,820
make kind of solidify Spinnaker's

00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:35,680
success do you think that the group is

00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:38,370
it has a momentum or is me some extra

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,320
work you definitely need some extra work

00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:44,230
Jenkins still is giving a very good

00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,090
fight even though there's just at CI to

00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,430
them they are adding the CD part

00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:51,280
customizing it each of these teams are

00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:54,280
and that is what we are experiencing in

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,780
Capital One is the other solutions that

00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,480
in the different lines of businesses

00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,230
that they are using is the simple jenkin

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:06,490
pipelines but they added the CD part of

00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:11,230
it because it is very familiar amongst

00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:14,500
the developer community we there is

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:18,460
definitely an alternate far far

00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:20,710
spinnaker but like Andrew mentioned that

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,230
we be used a hashey Corp schedules as

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,330
well vault for our secret management the

00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:28,210
integration with Walters something that

00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:31,980
we are looking into a native integration

00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:34,180
with wall and then a terraform and I our

00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,180
implementation of spinnaker also has a

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,950
different variation we use terraform for

00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,350
infrastructure provisioning not that

00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:44,140
like cloud driver capability right so

00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,720
that that consolidating all these use

00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,720
cases

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,150
and identifying which one is the right

00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,320
fit is also and providing some

00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:57,710
guidelines for the the spinnaker users

00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:04,640
will also help with ease of adoption do

00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:07,100
you have any question and in your case

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,630
what do you think about you know what

00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,330
contributed to the success of his

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:14,420
vinaigrettes or time and what needs to

00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:16,970
make your success absolutely so yeah

00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:21,050
this was a space that like I don't feel

00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:24,790
that there was a huge player in when in

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:28,730
a girl into it and there are things that

00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:30,320
obviously ridin into already mentioned

00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,480
in one of the things that like would

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,820
have really been helpful for us to have

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,870
as a new company onboarding spinnaker

00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,400
would have been this into NC I city

00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:43,520
integration where spinnaker doesn't come

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:47,540
just when your artifacts are ready and

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:50,150
deploy and take take that was ready and

00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:52,550
take those but having it into it similar

00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:55,460
to what you would market rate in jackets

00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:59,180
and I already spoke to armory about

00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:02,540
being a beta adapter for the tariff or

00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:15,350
on top of spinnaker I hope that's coming

00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:17,420
soon what's that and you know us here so

00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,980
right now is having most of the people

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,660
are building it you know so I talking

00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:25,050
pill versus buying you know where you

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:26,430
need more vendors to in this space or

00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,840
just the way we have seen in the

00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,190
communities were there a lot of you know

00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,380
players who are offering in our

00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,790
community which some in some cases know

00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,830
pencils but there is a vendor lock-in

00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:38,220
also so do you think we need more

00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:40,680
vendors also I met quite a few vendors

00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,290
today that was I didn't really know

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,360
about yeah it's it's definitely growing

00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:47,310
in people are willing to come on

00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,830
premises and install and set it up for

00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:52,020
you if you don't think that you have the

00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:54,510
bandwidth to do it yourself so that's

00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,450
definitely something that we see a

00:40:54,510 --> 00:41:02,700
trending right now and what would be in

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:05,220
your context you know by versus what it

00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,770
is very very use case specific right

00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,870
there is no one rule like I want to

00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,750
prefer this versus that it's basically

00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:16,320
what your use case what problem you want

00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:19,260
to solve if it is some I think a little

00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:24,240
bit mentioned initially if it is very

00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:27,000
strategic to my platform to my industry

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,670
that I operate and I would rather build

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,400
rather than going to a open source

00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:35,940
solution or outsourcing that right that

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,440
is my competitive advantage that is my

00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:42,000
IP I want to own it whereas if it is a

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,520
solution if it is a problem that is

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,740
common to a common to all the industries

00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,990
across if it is already out there I

00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,360
would rather buy it rather than building

00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:53,340
our if it is an open source product out

00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,540
there I would rather prefer that than

00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,590
buying something proprietary and in New

00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,560
York is what do you think there is a

00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:04,880
balance between vendors and users here

00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:08,520
yes I guess in our case we prefer to buy

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,470
if it's not part of our core business so

00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,940
I guess a similar maybe similar thing

00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:15,390
and then of course being a vendor we

00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,490
hope you please but it does happen from

00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:19,560
time to time where we engage with with

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,180
somebody and we get far and then they

00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:25,290
decide that they would rather manage it

00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,970
themselves and in that case for us we we

00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,310
change our positioning with them a

00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:30,870
little bit and now we treat them as a

00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,400
open source member and we try and

00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:35,550
empower them and help them in that way

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,950
and you know it's still important to us

00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,960
that okay it's great if we can get a

00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,210
custom rivet of if we can't if we need

00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,930
to grow the community so that's kind of

00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:48,030
how we walk that you've touched upon

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:50,700
where a customer was not contributing

00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:54,720
directly being or coming through you so

00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:58,230
how do you either encourage your

00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,230
customers to become one to deter or you

00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,400
before the middleman no we we prefer

00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,100
them to participate in the community

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,290
directly that'd be our preference we

00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,620
also you know if there's if there's you

00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:11,790
know on a customer site someone wants to

00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,890
contribute we helped set up a dev

00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,420
environment for them and kind of show

00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:18,360
them best practices that we've learned

00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,310
while developing and get them going a

00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,410
little bit and then talk about the

00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:23,580
process they can go through and we also

00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:26,130
hooked them up with people in the

00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,500
community to talk to to to get certain

00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:30,720
things done so usually that's one of the

00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,600
people that inflates our Google to help

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,030
them

00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,730
you approve their PRS and why not and

00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:39,380
we're not in your wildest makes more

00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:41,540
sense to contribute directly we know

00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,560
he's an employer through somebody what

00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,430
do you get

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,840
welcome to the contributing directly

00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,520
first I have to understand why would I

00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:52,670
have to go through someone else to

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,520
contribute back read my code and and I

00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:58,250
better contribute it back because I know

00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:01,520
I know my code better and also there is

00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:05,750
the yeah we talked about there is a

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:08,540
pride aspect of it too right I developed

00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:11,150
this and I'm solving this problem for

00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:13,970
the community and you cannot take that

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:18,140
away at all so that's that's a huge

00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:20,330
thing for our developers and your case

00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:24,740
also do you prefer to directly

00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:26,450
contribute because then you get yeah

00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:33,380
like I said we're too small to be able

00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:35,360
to yeah definitely to to also pro in the

00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,990
sense of pride and recognition right you

00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,610
to provide it to the developers I wanted

00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:43,310
to also say that like when we think

00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:45,580
about bill versus buy right so most

00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:48,110
developers are very inclined to build

00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,760
because it's fun you're building

00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:52,280
something from ground up project it

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,150
taking ten different tools and adopting

00:44:52,280 --> 00:45:00,050
them so it's more of a strategic move to

00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:02,390
say hey no there are so many options out

00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:05,030
there and we should buy and only build

00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:07,190
what is core for our business yeah I

00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:09,200
understand that customer they're wide it

00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,820
is more like telling Danny you have a

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,400
limited set of contributing themselves

00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,780
getting their page on github so should

00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,310
there be some incentive you know where

00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,700
I'm throwing question to all three of

00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,470
you

00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,970
so that organisation can you know you

00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:23,000
know either they don't understand how

00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,580
this source work or they don't want what

00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,010
is the reason why they don't want to

00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,480
they're doing all the work you said they

00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:33,070
are giving it to you you're pushing the

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:38,320
hood so I think that it has a lot to do

00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:41,800
with relationships who who who is really

00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,930
stewarding the project spinnaker project

00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,530
I think that's that's one piece of it

00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:49,540
the other piece of it is you have a

00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:54,390
license that spinnaker is out under

00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:54,390
Apache 2 so that license affects them

00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:00,890
other than that I don't have any great

00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:00,890
insight as to why they want to do that

00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:10,440
I mean there are two different set up

00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:12,720
you know people here all right what is

00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,950
what is your advice to me because the

00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,980
committee is going new people are

00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,989
playing with it what is your advice to

00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,450
people who are thinking of embracing and

00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:23,910
a lot of it is vinegar good lessons you

00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:29,900
have were mistakes you don't want them

00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:32,549
to me that you have already made yeah I

00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,180
see the tendency that spinnaker is

00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:38,789
becoming the next Swiss Army knife and

00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:40,380
the advice I'd say is to really

00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:42,109
understand what your needs are and

00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:46,019
understand whether that's for you or not

00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:48,890
and ideally get to talk to somebody in

00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:51,630
the community who can help you make that

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:55,619
make a recommendation who's been through

00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:57,779
the fire already who knows what it takes

00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:01,349
to Awards vinegar and to make sure that

00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:02,489
it's for you before you jump on it is

00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:04,319
there any pain point that you experience

00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:07,380
hey this problem should have been

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,839
stalled we still haven't hit with that I

00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,730
think we are still too early to I didn't

00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,430
mind that like this has been a pain

00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,590
point for us

00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,610
and what is because you have you know

00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:21,440
they've been using it what is your

00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:25,070
advice to patients I think the

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:28,490
flexibility is very very glamorous with

00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:29,720
spinnaker right when we started with

00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:33,890
spinnaker Derby

00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:36,620
that was our mantra is like hey this is

00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:39,020
so flexible whatever CI tool that you

00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,700
have you can you can use it you bring it

00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,770
whatever bill strips that you have you

00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:44,840
will help you arc astray so people

00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:47,990
started creating freestyle pipe lines

00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:50,780
like right right and left up to a point

00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:54,230
where it became very hard to manage and

00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:57,230
push any any regulation and complains to

00:47:54,230 --> 00:48:00,200
these pipelines right then we have to

00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:02,030
backtrack and look at where we can

00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:05,360
introduce best practices because some

00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:08,570
people are using spinnaker because it is

00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:10,670
flexible but in a wrong way right so but

00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:13,280
those are all the things that we have to

00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:16,220
identify this is not a best practice but

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,670
how do we lock down some of these best

00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:22,970
practices still provide flexibility to

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:25,460
bring their own implementation and then

00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:28,640
is something that we had to learn after

00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:33,440
a while so that I would definitely

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:35,300
advise if it is if your use case doesn't

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,550
need all those flexibility just don't

00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:40,550
expose it because it's very very hard to

00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:43,760
maintain if you are supporting spinnaker

00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:48,230
for your organization and your charge

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:51,140
for advice I think that the the biggest

00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:53,030
thing we've learned is the Carolla out

00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,220
plan for adopting spinnaker you need to

00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,350
take it very seriously it isn't if you

00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,240
want to be successful if you want to

00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,920
really spread spinnaker across your

00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,500
organization you need to come up with a

00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,720
real plan and it can't be hey guys I

00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,820
installed this check it out you got to

00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,880
really gotta really put some effort into

00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,140
it and I think treating it so this is

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,810
going usually going through a platform

00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:17,360
team or a DevOps team and if that team

00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,770
treats it as a as a product that they're

00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,080
offering and they're the rest of their

00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:22,180
developers are the cost

00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,770
if they treated it very seriously this

00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:26,470
way and it really and understand the

00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:28,690
needs of the customer also educate the

00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:30,550
customer and you know so do training

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:33,730
provide documentation that's very

00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,830
specific to your organization make a

00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,930
gold standard pipeline kind of to what

00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:41,410
you're describing and say okay we're

00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:43,510
gonna support you you know full full

00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:45,010
heartedly if you do it this way if you

00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:47,080
view outside of this way we'll help you

00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:50,350
but you aren't gonna you know it doesn't

00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:52,000
count as a p0 sort of thing and then you

00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:54,310
know from there come out with a rollout

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,610
plan target your your very first

00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:01,900
customer in your org should be somebody

00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:03,850
a team that is very well respected if as

00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,280
soon as that very well-respected team is

00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,590
becoming successful with spinnaker the

00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,920
other teams are gonna just copy them

00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:13,000
they want on and then you thin at that

00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,250
time everyone's gonna want a flood you

00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,320
need to gate them and and make sure you

00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:19,510
can support them and come up with a

00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,100
rollout plan to eventually over some

00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:25,660
period of time you'll have your entire

00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:29,380
organization on before we wrap up one

00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,360
last question for everyone yeah yeah one

00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,070
last question is for our offices you

00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,980
mentioned it's become your Swiss Army

00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:38,140
knife so there is also risk that it may

00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,850
lose focus and become bloated as some

00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,590
open source products have experience I

00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:43,360
don't want too many of them so what is

00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:45,160
you know you complete possible that this

00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,340
is what a spinnaker company should or

00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,340
should not

00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:56,829
it's a tough one using it for last

00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,270
I'd say focus on delivery yeah start

00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:01,569
with the delivery in the software

00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:03,160
delivery lifecycle Spinnaker's right in

00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:06,010
the middle you have build over here and

00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,410
you have posts you're monitoring and

00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:11,589
alerting over here if we if we focus and

00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:13,869
just really make delivery good I think

00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:18,400
it'll happen naturally if that's the

00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:22,470
focus okay any any questions you have

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,470
I'm sure you have one or two questions

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:29,670
so thanks everybody thank you thank you

00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:34,830
