[Music]

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,029
I'm here to talk about evolution and

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,939
feature of deployments my name is

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,140
Brandon I'm actually armories newest

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:31,920
engineer started there two months ago

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,930
it's been a blast but a little bit about

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,020
me as I said software engineer an armory

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,370
I love to automate anything that I can

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,399
at my last job that was I'm gonna talk

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,579
more about this but my last job

00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,649
everything was manual everything so I

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,780
tried to automate as much as I can to

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,489
take the human error out of the problem

00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:00,539
you can follow me on github Twitter

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,250
those are my handles on that and next

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm gonna get to know you guys a little

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,860
bit so how many of you are still

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,760
deploying manually to like local data

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,380
centers anybody's still doing that okay

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,110
that's good

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,400
deploying only to the cloud all right

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:25,710
how many of you are actually deploying

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,409
with spinnaker right now all right what

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:34,920
about in three months from now looking

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:37,070
for more adopters awesome so I want to

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,229
talk about a brief history of

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:44,369
deployments kind of from the very

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:47,490
beginning so in the beginning software

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,049
was deployed with the hardware you want

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,229
a new software you had to buy new

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,630
hardware not the best when you think

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,680
about it today it was extremely costly

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,820
back then too to update your software

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,310
you were pretty much locked into

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,869
whatever vendor that you bought the

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:09,179
hardware from so we had the advent of

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,060
the micro computers software was sent

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,680
out to customers either on tape later on

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,030
on floppy disks

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:23,420
a little while later cd-roms DVDs came

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:26,430
way later so we had ways of delivering

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,670
software to our users at a and a much

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:37,439
quicker pace but still not quick enough

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:40,290
so the internet was born this changed

00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,540
the game but only to those who actually

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,389
paid attention to what you could now do

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,989
there were still too many people

00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:51,209
deploying their software with CD ROMs if

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,090
you're a big fan of video games you had

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,620
to go to the store wait in line buy the

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,650
new expansion pack for your favorite

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,849
game I remember doing that for Diablo 2

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:05,519
when that came out many years ago one of

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,829
my all-time favorite games nowadays I

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,459
can just go to Blizzard store buy the

00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:14,299
game have it downloaded in ten minutes

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,379
and I don't even have to put pants on

00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:20,310
you could do all of that type of stuff

00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:22,530
now things have changed drastically and

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,609
again software was no longer running on

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,459
the same machine

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,629
there were software that was from

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,220
somebody else's machine that you had

00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,220
possibly no idea who it was

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,530
so I wanted to do a quick pause here

00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,599
anybody see a problem with the way

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:44,009
software used to be delivered back in

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:47,400
the olden days I should say still

00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:52,079
extremely slowly there was no such thing

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,989
as sending out patches for most most

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,259
software videogames didn't really see it

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,959
it wasn't until much later if it was

00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:03,750
like a security patch for an operating

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,079
system depending on who the provider was

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,819
you may get lucky sometimes there if

00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:13,229
there's a security vulnerability nobody

00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:17,720
cared so it took months if not years to

00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,720
deploy new versions of software

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,280
all right so then we can go to manual

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,190
deployments I kind of mentioned this

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,410
little earlier my last job was manual

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,870
deployments these were the steps I had

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,010
to do to deploy our software in

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,139
production ssh into a physical machine

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:43,530
pull the code down compile the code

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,110
deploy the code then go to step one for

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,050
each machine that we had before our

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,210
application by the time I left we had

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:57,090
six machines so upgrades took you know

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,790
about 45 minutes maybe an hour depending

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,639
if the upgrade was quick and easy or if

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,100
we ran into issues if we ran into issues

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,340
sometimes we had to rollback if that was

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,740
possible it wasn't always possible so

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:15,330
there's a lot of lot of issues with this

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:18,000
manual deployment then we go into

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,960
configuration management tools stuff

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,900
like ansible chef puppet salts probably

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,960
some dive didn't list on here it helps

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,389
reduce the complexity some things are no

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,900
longer manual which is a very very very

00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,789
good step and it can have you can have a

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,930
history of your actual configuration and

00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:41,580
how stuff has changed over over time not

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,370
something that you typically have with a

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,919
manual deployment unless you were the

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,139
type of person to go out go and grab

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,360
your your physical pad and pad of paper

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,479
and a pen and write down we did this

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,460
change on this day this time these are

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,039
the changes these are the issues we ran

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,599
into and then if you were lucky enough

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,560
to have a ticketing system of some sort

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,720
maybe populating that ticketing system

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,669
so there is plenty of plenty of issues

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,289
of configuration management help solve

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:16,700
some of them now we start talking about

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:19,740
continuous integration and delivery this

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:22,380
these processes can they kind of enabled

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,460
the whole software as-a-service sing a

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:29,280
lot nicer and when you have thousands of

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,460
users you can't do things manually

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,110
because and the thousands of users cases

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,250
you may have a hundred different

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,500
machines if it takes five minutes to SSH

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,389
and pull down your code compile and

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,750
deploy your application per one machine

00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:49,919
you have a hundred machines that's a

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:53,370
long time spent on kind of a redundant

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,830
task CIN CD kind of helped alleviate

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,349
some of those needs and some of the

00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,830
tools use jenkins bamboo circle CI

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:05,099
Travis CI and my last job we use get lab

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:08,009
CI I didn't put get labs CI on here

00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:10,320
because that's relatively newer these

00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:13,080
have all been out for a few much longer

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,000
time than then get lab CI but they all

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,070
do roughly the same thing

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,449
there's obviously minor differences or

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,639
sometimes big differences between the

00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:25,190
two but essentially they they all do the

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,570
same type of thing so where are we today

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:31,800
so with those of you with weak hearts

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:34,229
please leave the room now some of us are

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,599
still stuck in the past as I said my

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:39,659
Kurt but my previous job this is what we

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,729
had to do so again

00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,680
SSA Shing into into a physical machine

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,860
pulling the code down compiling

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,250
deploying and go to one for each machine

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:55,080
and in the process it's really not

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:58,169
sustainable stuck in the past part two

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,719
some we did eventually make this the

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:04,560
switch from physical machines virtual

00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:08,250
machines yay but still there was plenty

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,169
of issues with that you could also use

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,449
some cloud provider but if you're still

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,030
doing those manual steps of manually SSH

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,349
seeing into an ec2 instance and doing

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:20,099
all those other things you're not really

00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,780
getting a lot of the benefits and you

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,729
could also use CI tools to help cut down

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,680
on some of the build times and like

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:30,000
generate some artifacts and that's what

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,399
we did we had multiple Java web

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,930
applications and what we would do is we

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,430
would use CI to build those and then

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,860
part of our deployment process was to

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,740
pull down the pre compiled code and

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,270
deploy it for us so it was less time

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,230
spent when I first started

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:53,320
that at the company in 2013 build times

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:56,530
were about an hour and a half by the

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,500
time I left August of this year build

00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:02,020
times are down to five minutes so we did

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:07,600
a lot of work to to do that and it was

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:09,820
unfortunately so much work and that kind

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,520
of goes into these scripts plus CI and

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,130
CD we had scripts on top of gate lab CI

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,930
to go ahead and help cut down on some of

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:22,450
that cruft for us a get push essentially

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,700
triggered a CI job to kick off the build

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,830
script the build script to produce some

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:31,840
sort of artifact we would upload it to a

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:34,690
sauna type Nexus server to to handle all

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,720
of that then again we had another script

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,880
to deploy the resulting artifact there's

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,520
a big problem with this though there's

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,190
no dashboard to see where you are in

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,870
this process you can kind of look if

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,300
you're using a see some of the CI tools

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,690
they do have pipeline stages

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,540
I know gitlab does but they're not not

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,380
that not the best you have to they're

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,700
not as nice as what spinnaker provides

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,250
but if you don't unfortunately you don't

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,930
have your if your tooling doesn't have

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,610
some sort of dashboard to see you're

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:12,130
kind of left in the dark as to where you

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:15,700
are in your deployment and then where we

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,670
are today spinnaker has notifications

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,220
built in pipelines cool things like

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,020
automated canary analysis there's a few

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,930
talks and there's a workshop yesterday

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,720
on that so these are things that we get

00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,610
with spinnaker things that we didn't we

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,610
would have to build extra tooling on top

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:38,860
of a bunch of other tooling in order to

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:41,260
get something like this so next I want

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:45,460
to talk about stages of software

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:49,060
delivery but before I do that let's play

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:53,350
a game there used to be paper and

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:55,270
pencils on everybody's seats but these

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,910
slides would be available afterwards but

00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,320
the thing is with this game we're going

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,790
to we're going to talk about a few

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,110
different things

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,980
have a bunch of points and we're gonna

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:09,339
see where we fall in a list of about

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:15,069
five different stages so the number of

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:16,980
deployments per month so my last place

00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:20,319
one to two deployments per month was

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:24,240
actually a good month some months we had

00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:27,670
zero because of I worked at a university

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,310
they were they didn't like change which

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,190
I totally understand it made sense for a

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,230
lot of cases we didn't have a lot of

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,449
tooling to help us so one to two

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:41,470
deployments per month was about average

00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:44,079
for us if you do one or two deployments

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:47,800
or month give yourself a points three to

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,930
ten deployments for month two points and

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,149
if you are awesome and doing like nine

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,290
hundred plus deployments in a month

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:58,480
give yourself ten points and nine

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:03,790
hundred plus diplomas per month is an

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:07,540
insane number yeah yeah production

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,730
deployments I was lucky enough to before

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,670
I left my that my last job I set up

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,790
deployments to our dev and staging

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:18,339
environments so we were getting up maybe

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,160
not to 900 per month but definitely in

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:23,110
about the hundred range but the issue is

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,959
that never got the production nobody

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,610
actually was able to test it so if

00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,370
you're deploying to deploying that much

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:33,040
to dev and look at staging that's

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,389
awesome that's a great first step but if

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,209
you're not doing it to production not

00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,949
getting real users to use it in many

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,199
cases you're kind of left in the dust

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:44,500
and it you don't know what you're doing

00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:46,990
is actually going to work and I know

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,779
some places have unbelievable scale to

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:52,899
keep in mind and you know maybe taking

00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:55,930
five percent of their traffic to like a

00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:59,620
dev server might be a good thing that's

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,180
only 5% of their traffic if we were to

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,800
do that we're where I was before that

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:10,689
would be maybe one user so not much not

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:13,500
a really good good test really so the

00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:16,770
number of manual steps to deploy

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,410
20-plus give yourself a points if you

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:22,080
have zero manual steps to deploy give

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,880
yourself 10 and patch stuff on the back

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,650
because that's actually probably one of

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,150
the hardest things to do is getting from

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:34,350
a full manual process down to zero

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:36,300
getting down to one to three is is

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:40,110
extremely challenging and going to that

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:43,020
zero that can take a menorah amount of

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:48,990
time but once you get there you will be

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:51,390
so thankful before I continue anybody

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:55,470
doing 20 plus manual steps to deploy to

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:57,780
production no hands awesome you guys are

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,020
on your way how many of you are actually

00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:07,650
doing zero manual steps to deploy to

00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:09,660
production alright good good so if you

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,730
guys can help the rest of the room get

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,030
to that point I think everybody here

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:17,190
would greatly appreciate it I definitely

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:21,870
know at my last place I definitely would

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:26,520
have loved to talk to you guys so the

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:28,920
time to deploy so how many how many

00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:33,480
months does it take for something to

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,820
actually get to production or in this

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,310
case minutes it takes minutes for your

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,880
code to be checked in and goes to

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,620
production if again if you if it took

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,990
over a month or so you know give

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,930
yourself a point if it takes minutes to

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:55,200
get to production give yourself 10

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:58,740
points alright so dev verse ops verse

00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,920
DevOps if you're a dev at op dev verse

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,500
ops shop give yourself a point if you

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,340
fully embrace the DevOps culture give

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,410
yourself three

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,390
it also pat yourself on the back that

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:13,370
would is a really hard a hard sell and

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:15,630
in many cases what does that say

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,900
beautiful verse immutable deploys if

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:20,820
your deployment is a is mutable give

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,340
yourself actually maybe not even one

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,250
point maybe 0 it's never a good thing

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,329
you don't know what has changed your cat

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,579
you could be left in a very

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:31,079
in consistent state if you have

00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,970
immutable infrastructure and the

00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:37,799
immutable deploys give yourself three

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:40,829
points all right so these are extra pick

00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:43,199
all that apply so if you're deploying to

00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,790
your own you know small data center I

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,299
mean if you're somebody like Google who

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:50,699
has data centers yeah I mean I don't

00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,040
think this really applies to you if

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,989
you're deploying to the cloud give

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,939
yourself two points if you're doing

00:15:54,989 --> 00:16:00,269
continuous deployments give yourself

00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:03,449
seven if you're using micro services and

00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:05,189
have embraced the splitting up of a

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:06,600
giant monolith into something that's

00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:08,970
actually more manageable

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,639
give yourself seven points if you're

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,980
doing automated rollbacks which is a

00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,619
phenomenal feature give yourself ten

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:21,660
points anybody here using automated

00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:27,720
rollbacks no oh come on guys read this

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:29,610
vinegar okay okay we got one good all

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,699
right so these are the stages of

00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:36,209
software delivery so we have at the very

00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:39,089
very bottom part stage one - snail very

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:41,610
very slow you can kind of see where I

00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,899
got the points idea from if you take I

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:47,009
don't know how well you guys can read

00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:54,179
that but the the bottom section kind of

00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:56,339
helps correlate to those points so where

00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,019
do you stack up if you have 0 to 6

00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:02,309
points you're here in stage one

00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:04,519
unfortunately seven to 15 and in about

00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:10,139
stage two

00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:14,899
16:43 about stage three 43 to 56 stage

00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:18,630
four 57 plus awesome you're in stage 5

00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:22,860
so the big question is is is why am I

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:26,730
talking about this we need to move

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:29,549
people along these stages if we have

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,559
more people closer in the stages three

00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:34,080
four and five the better off every

00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:37,830
developer is going to be being stuck in

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,000
a stage one is a little demoralizing

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:43,190
once you have learned about other way

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,280
of deploying software you'll get very

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,250
frustrated with having to come in and in

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,040
my case 4 a.m. on a Wednesday morning to

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,450
deploy something to production and you

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,020
still had to put in your full days worth

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,150
of work in case something went wrong

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:02,630
so we we need to help people in those

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,670
situations come up to speed getting

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,750
everybody to stage 5 would be a

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:11,180
phenomenal idea I know it's not possible

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:16,490
but if we can get them closer to stage 5

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:19,970
that would be ideal so how do we

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,180
actually do this so moving from stage to

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,580
stage

00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:29,240
so unfortunately again we can't go from

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,890
stage one to five and 60 seconds it's

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,400
some of the concepts are harder to

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:38,510
understand automated canary analysis if

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,750
you were to talk to a student a student

00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:44,120
at a university a canary is a bird I

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,530
think not something to do with software

00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,370
they may have a harder time

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,230
understanding that concept even senior

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,930
developers who have never had an

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,640
opportunity to work in this type of

00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,830
environments may not know what a canary

00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,630
is they should hopefully be able to pick

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,960
it up rather quickly but in some cases

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:06,320
that they may not be true it's also a

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,690
very large learning curve I went from a

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,350
stage one company to pretty much a Stage

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:15,620
five so it is possible but mostly for

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,600
the individual not for the company and I

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,250
will tell you the learning curve I've

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,940
been at this job now for two months with

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:25,580
our Murray oh man I have learned so much

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:29,480
over the last two months on automated

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,160
rollbacks canary analysis the pipeline

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,890
concept being able to codify that

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,140
pipeline so that way you know what has

00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:40,850
changed with the pipeline all of these

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,830
types of things are amazing and they're

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,140
it's a lot to take in you have to spend

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,180
a large amount of time to get familiar

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,650
with everything so you're able to come

00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,670
up here next year and give a talk

00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:56,010
stakeholders may be unable to advance do

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,560
you either political reasons money

00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:02,670
reasons you know time resources people

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,650
if you have a very small departments my

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:06,630
entire IT department was about

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,960
thirty-five people that included

00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:14,670
developers operations people server

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,710
people procurement people from a

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,160
developer standpoint we had like four

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:23,100
developers and we managed all of the

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,830
resources for the university that's a

00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:30,090
lot to handle for four developers we

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,640
managed to make do with what we had and

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,380
it's a public university so funding is

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,420
hard to come by so being able to hire

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,570
people has always been a problem for

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,100
them so that's partially why

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,590
stakeholders may be unable to advance

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,770
not enough people not enough money to

00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:50,160
spend on on products yes spinnaker is

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,020
open source but if you don't understand

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,030
spinnaker to begin with you may need

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,700
consulting you may need people to come

00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,410
and help you set that up or at least

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,810
teach you the basics that's gonna cost

00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:05,610
money and unfortunately a lot of

00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:07,800
companies don't have that ability so

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,830
what can we do we need to get more

00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,630
people to come to events like this or

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:17,790
meetup groups um Alex in the room know

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,290
one of the people at armory has one of

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,090
the largest spinnaker meetup groups in

00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,040
the I think it is the largest particular

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,690
meetup group in the Bay Area like

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,140
fourteen fifteen hundred members

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:29,660
something like that we need to start

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,280
getting people into those events and

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,380
teaching them hey these are the basics

00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,140
this is how this works here's where you

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,810
can help us here's a went to a talk

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:43,680
earlier today from who knows Emily and

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:46,950
and Lars about how to get more people to

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,450
help contribute to open source perfect

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,910
we need more talks like that we need to

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,280
get people interested and helping the

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,830
project that kind of talks to make the

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,480
pain points less painful if we can do

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,870
that

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,640
everybody's gonna be better off and we

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,440
can help build the contribute to to

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,549
better tools and spinnaker I believe is

00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,980
one of the better tools out there

00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:12,090
so I want to kind of switch gears a

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,950
little bit and let's talk about the

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:18,359
future what are some cool things that we

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:21,450
can do so Internet of Things deploying

00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,359
to a Raspberry Pi hooking up spinnaker

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,269
to actually deploy to a Raspberry Pi one

00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,960
of my co-workers his name's Kevin he's

00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,570
on in the room

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,239
dang it so we had this thing called the

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,139
flip desk

00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:38,159
unfortunately the animation is not the

00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:39,659
best but essentially him and I work at

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,399
it and one of his friend one of our

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:45,119
friends works on it after work every now

00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:49,129
and then and but essentially we can play

00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:51,989
like an animated gif with it we could

00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:53,700
display images and it essentially like

00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:55,919
takes an image and like pixel lights

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,799
that kind of into a cup-like and white

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,799
photo and be able to display it it's a

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,269
really cool really cool tool so we've

00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,009
talked about potentially adding a cloud

00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:07,559
driver thing to actually deploy to a

00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,450
Raspberry Pi I don't know how much work

00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:13,679
is involved with that but I think it'd

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:16,049
be really cool deploying the medical

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,389
devices this one's actually really cool

00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:21,509
I'm actually a type 1 diabetic and

00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:24,119
there's so many cool medical devices for

00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:25,799
them for diabetics there's continuous

00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,029
glucose monitors there's insulin pumps

00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:31,710
all of it has software in it nowadays

00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:35,220
why not use something like spinnaker to

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,200
deploy to it or even something maybe

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,359
Spinnaker's not the tool 10 years from

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,169
now maybe we get something else being

00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,509
able to deploy to medical devices

00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:46,619
pacemakers have software in them now

00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:48,629
it's kind of scary to think about

00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:51,840
security obviously will need to be

00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:54,049
tightened down a lot I personally don't

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,029
know if I would trust a medical device

00:23:54,049 --> 00:24:00,259
like that but you know maybe in a few

00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:04,340
years once the stuff gets a lot better

00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:06,450
it'll be it'll actually be worthwhile

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,149
there's medical devices that actually

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:12,389
ship off data to your doctor for you to

00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:14,249
or there's a company called Dexcom they

00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:16,289
make a continuous glucose monitor and

00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:18,359
what it can actually do is send out text

00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,250
messages alerts it's like your family if

00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:22,550
you have low blood sugar

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,980
if you have low blood sugar you have the

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:28,770
high chance of dying so this can help

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:32,340
alert people that hey somebody has to

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:34,320
come and save me right now so there is a

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:38,550
bunch of software going on in these

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,980
tools or in these devices that software

00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,600
needs to be updated nobody wants to have

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,080
a medical device that has a security

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,130
vulnerability that is connected to Wi-Fi

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,730
that would just be a very very very

00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:53,070
scary thought

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,780
deploying two cars I really like this

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,360
one I'm actually from the Metro Detroit

00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,230
area so like half the people I know

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,370
works for either Ford Chrysler or GM

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,140
these guys are actually in this game now

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:08,820
there they are working on autonomous

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:11,520
vehicles I think it was GM and Honda was

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,340
it our teaming may may not have been

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,470
Honda but are teaming up to do some

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,990
autonomous vehicle stuff that's awesome

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:22,440
that's all software that's hardware as

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:26,010
well but they're they they need they

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:29,210
need software to be updated the thing is

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,960
if the big three are deploying software

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,360
that means they're actually in a pretty

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,040
good game right now typically the auto

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,820
industry has been a little bit further

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,260
behind minute has come-to software it

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:44,910
they have now started to embrace stuff

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:47,220
like the Google and Apple both have

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,960
infotainment systems available for for

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,720
vehicles they have now started to fully

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,360
embrace that they're they're changing

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,490
that that's assignment a callow cat and

00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,150
say hey guys maybe you should help join

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:05,790
us and autonomous vehicles will need

00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:08,270
updates as well so the next thing is

00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:11,400
deploying to the cloud not the cloud

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,440
what I mean by that is being able to

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,620
take your application and one pipeline

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,050
and be able to deploy it to any cloud

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,420
cloud agnostic essentially because it

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,820
doesn't really matter what cloud you're

00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,860
on as long as you can contact all other

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,830
services that are required for that that

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,200
service to actually function so does it

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,920
matter if one piece is in as your the

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,950
other ones

00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,750
and Google the other ones an AWS the

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,430
other ones and I don't know your own

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,790
local data center it doesn't really

00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:44,340
matter we could potentially help to work

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,600
something like this into the product you

00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,450
don't really have to think of the cloud

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,090
the developer doesn't need to care where

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,860
the application is deployed we're kinda

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,280
at that point right now but in some

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,230
cases you're tied to a specific cloud

00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,620
provider like somebody may be deep into

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,060
GCP for certain reasons but you don't

00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,380
you may not want to have to think about

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,050
that if you're a newer developer you

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,160
just want to write your code and and go

00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,170
home

00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,900
so this is one thing that we could we

00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:16,760
could potentially do so this is

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,560
essentially the the future of what I

00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,180
would I've been thinking about - I'm

00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,770
really interested in our obviously the

00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:28,140
medical devices and the car aspect

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,400
there's probably other things that I if

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,260
you give me more time I can probably

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,760
think about I'm sure you guys have some

00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:37,200
awesome ideas and where to take this as

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:41,250
well so you know transition a little bit

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,710
I work at armory we're hiring if you

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,750
want to work somewhere awesome

00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:49,470
talk to me I think our booth is still up

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:53,640
over just right across the hall come

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,860
talk to us even if you have if you're

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,840
from a stage one company you can still

00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,570
go to armory I'm proof of that I've been

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,200
here for two months I have learned a ton

00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:07,650
and I think if any of you were to join

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,030
join the team you would as well I work

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:13,020
with a lot of really awesome engineers

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:16,710
that have just said an awesome job of

00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:22,200
teaching me everything that a good

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:26,360
developer should know so with that thank

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,360
you guys anybody have any questions

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,000
