00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,270
[Music]

00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,490
you

00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,820
all right if you're a business you pay

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,620
for value delivery something I tell

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,329
myself as an architect that I can

00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,770
usually cool thing but how does it help

00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,020
the business I'm trying to help right

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,910
they're paying for a value delivery

00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,290
either for customers open source

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,410
community or at a greater business

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:54,000
ecosystem no one is paying for

00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:57,420
I couldn't release something so I have

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,290
so from personal experience

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,140
actually released something in the

00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,360
production office someone's laptop which

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,220
is kind of fun when we're developing

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,479
this feature which is strange because in

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,220
the content link space so which

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,680
security-related

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,270
that made even worse but there was the

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
week and we were in pre-release and the

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,049
developer went on vacation and where was

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,939
the code it was on his laptop

00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:22,090
where his laptop as house where he where

00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:25,060
was he eight times on the way right so

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,500
you know having a unpleasant the point

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,390
process is not something you can give

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,890
your management or a vpe saying oh we

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,369
couldn't release in this window because

00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,410
our process is kind of stuff now you

00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:37,600
don't you want to pay for value delivery

00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,940
you also want to maximize creative hours

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,100
you want to spend more time if you're a

00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,840
developer or if you're a program manager

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,390
or a technical manager saying I need to

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,460
work on the user experience and approved

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,440
features like you know from Home Depot

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,150
I'm talking about you so if you ever or

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,770
an appliance at Home Depot

00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,690
did you a pick a delivery order and

00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,740
you're behind the guy he's in the

00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:01,630
world's ugliest 2001 HTML app HTML 1.0

00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,310
apt clicking away and I go oh it my name

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,900
drawing goes back all the settings are

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:11,019
gone so and then we both go so more time

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,510
on creative hours improving features and

00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:15,340
then since you can't get VC funding

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,319
about AI rml on your title so you have

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,569
to do some block graph IOT ml cloud

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,930
drone thing to get your series a done

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:26,680
spend time on this but not on why did my

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,810
build break not all where did it go so

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,690
had experienced where with homespun

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,640
build tool and you had to have multiple

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,319
tabs to Atos and there are things in the

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,379
bill to you do deploy inability and like

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,200
wait a min where did it actually where

00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:44,139
did I go to and five minutes later oh

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,720
yeah went around place so that's not a

00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:48,519
good answer either

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,430
now we're hurdles that enterprises are

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,379
facing getting started containerized

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,909
apps moving to the cloud and releasing

00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:56,739
all day every day we all know these are

00:02:54,909 --> 00:03:00,400
things we need to do we keep hearing at

00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,810
every conference every TechCrunch oh you

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,250
need be in containers on crew Bernays

00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,079
you need be in the cloud which cloud i

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,180
know all of the clouds well cause all

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,980
the things and we need to release all

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,239
day every day because we were told to do

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,069
that that makes sense it's perfect it

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,510
does work but you have this time to

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,180
bootstrap that app development

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,940
experience should that be a hurdle for

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,069
real or not for real maybe you have a

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,379
continuous scale that's not really all

00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,879
that spectacular I referenced my

00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:31,480
previous example of where does something

00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:36,239
go and our fancy homespun built built on

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:38,530
top of chef pearl Jabba Bosch everything

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,209
and existing arm yeah I'm totally

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,170
talking about myself you can see

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,940
automation Rugel burrow fertility I do

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,440
developers have cloud experience do they

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,639
need to have that cloud experience

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,530
that's not a hurdle people asking

00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,299
themselves do they me I'm a great or

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,790
someone's a great spring I am NOT a

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,870
great job developer I used to be one so

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,549
until I lie sorry you have great devalue

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,699
of great developer great algorithms you

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,799
can really do some really fancy fancy

00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,540
Monte Carlo discrete heat base fancy

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,329
stuff back when I was younger and can do

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:15,730
that but may not know much about a cloud

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:17,709
or containers so that leads us into we

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,329
have those hurdle dare why spinnaker

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,639
know the first thing before talk about

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:25,000
why spinnaker I'm gonna go into why

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,740
continues to live a little bit so I am

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,050
one of the people who pay for the ACM

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,840
digital library they go browse stories

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,419
and when that articles whatnot so out of

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,449
these spins they have a whole collection

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:39,490
of work already actually case studies on

00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:42,280
you know how organizations have evolved

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,190
into releasing every single day and then

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,050
their discussion they have this phrase

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,919
and what I like about this phrase is the

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:54,520
implication that if you read the heart

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,979
no publication there that in the

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,540
beginning in a lean post agile software

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:01,120
company

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,490
wait a minute a saying they just say

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,840
that that if you're if you're protein

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,880
kinase delivery you're pushing this lien

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,890
put like whoa that's that's really

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,540
interesting in the title of it and these

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,010
slides will be available somewhere so

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,280
you click on a link it'll take you to

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,680
the paywall for the digital library

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,860
title is tours post agile development

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,960
practices through Pocket eyes pocket

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,730
eyes prioritize development

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,990
infrastructure so you're not building

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,960
something just to get something done

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,730
they're suggesting if you treated your

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,950
software delivery system with enough

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,740
robustus as you want your production

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,570
environment to be they're implying after

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,890
what you know they details the entire

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,050
process as organization went through

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,000
they're implying that you get the

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,890
release every day you don't care if it's

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,100
containers vans or whatever because you

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:50,230
have enough process maturity by accident

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,110
no in this particular paper they don't

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,180
go into the we had the goal of being a

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,190
cm eye level fat no no it's like we want

00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,240
to release every day so it's actually

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,620
great works in a space this was

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,830
published in roscoe and 2015 there's one

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,710
and extreme programming a couple years

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,930
ago was based on a study and they gave

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,720
the timeline oh and night in nineteen

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,310
and 2008 late the first a second year of

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,800
Hudson so that's how long some of these

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,800
studies went into you

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,060
so we know sorry based on this that man

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,890
if I just get serious with everything

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:28,510
I'm a lean edge I'm posed agile well

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,670
that's what spinnaker is is a

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,920
continuously platform not the day and

00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,590
tomorrow you have all these wonderful

00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,050
deep dive spectacular talks like there's

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,880
one like manifest rate deployments cuz

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm one of those Yama all the time tight

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,630
people

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,550
the day you get talked about why I want

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,830
to do this so I'm walking through why so

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,600
now you have talking points take my home

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,180
but I'll talk about spin is the most

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,560
important thing here it is a continuous

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:59,080
delivery platform I apologize if I

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,210
mumble a little bit cuz I I'm from I

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,940
flew here from New York I'm from South

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,430
flyover country so sometime the accents

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,900
blend so I apologize alright I play East

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,410
Coast latest on television I'm not a

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,250
real one but yes spinnaker is bolte

00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,470
cloudy

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,330
which is what you want a lot of

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,760
customers our previous customers I had

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,230
they were ahead days as everywhere I'm

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,110
off telling a single have story

00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,450
yesterday about InfoSec people freaking

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,520
out because all these DSS emotes have

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,290
showed up and we're like yeah you're you

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,790
have a store in Spain now well it's a

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,130
concrete slab but you'll have a store of

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,750
Spain now but you have global

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,580
organizations that need to reach

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,740
customers globally so you need this

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,300
multi reasonable D cloud and then oh and

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,490
in that example they were in three cloud

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,550
providers to sardis stumbled in the

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,710
three of them was like oh yeah

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,990
but you'll learn the rest of the day a

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:53,500
lot about kubernetes there's eight of us

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,150
talk later in this summit keeping our

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,490
slide yeah could you leave a platform we

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,170
know that orchestration and it has

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,390
pipelines the most important thing is

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:04,870
the orchestration component yes it has

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,090
but it's not a CI solution do not ask it

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,280
do may even build for you if not what's

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:13,900
purpose about it's about orchestrating

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,150
things in your enterprise now what's

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,770
important for that today even think

00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,169
about it for orchestration of the

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,740
enterprise it's a software delivery

00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:25,780
control plane so if I think of it as my

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,660
software delivery control plane if I

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,180
provide or use the often of Z for that

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,419
then I don't have to give every

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,890
developer like route across every is so

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,969
how many have organization where they

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,650
have double developers have like a

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:44,229
ministry or star and like you're a to us

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,400
account right so you don't have to admit

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,720
that you wouldn't want to and people

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,190
read your nametag and see what company

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,430
you aren't hack you

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:53,950
but since I've been doing a debye since

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,570
2010 I have experienced that where every

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,270
developer has like full at measure

00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,580
access if you create spinnaker is your

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:03,070
stock fertility control plane you give

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,230
you to off and on Z there and not

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,350
everything and is so for example if

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:11,320
you're doing mostly containers on gke

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,570
and our project and are using code build

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,210
that developer need maybe some database

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,120
access code build stackdriver

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,170
spinnaker and you can play around with

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,440
that and you know maybe a little more

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,570
than that because look at this picture

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,870
right here

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,360
in ten seconds I know that I have

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,460
something behind a load balancer is two

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,290
instances harm isn't available there's a

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,510
parent there the container name I know

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,640
has a pod with the issue aside car I

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,110
knew all that in ten seconds I didn't

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,540
have to go look three four during places

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,060
and then over here in the side I have

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:49,860
the cube UI now there's anyone here from

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:52,380
armory no one so I asked them to do some

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,010
work so it would be really awesome so

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,750
they did add a dog integration if if in

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:02,010
that ten seconds I knew that and then I

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,870
clicked on Windows pods and jump me ride

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,820
a dog so I get all the stats and stuff

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,380
in there that would be super awesome and

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,880
I want armory do that because they had

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,720
VC money so they shouldn't have a

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,520
problem doing that I'm suggesting it's

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,340
my software delivery control plane and

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,890
the only thing I'm missing is to jump

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:24,240
right into seeing where it what's going

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,410
on so if I'm a developer and I have

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
ability to go right into the log

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,430
solution because I'm a day dog fan they

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,070
have logging now they have an APM with a

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,800
watchdog thing all that awesomeness that

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,250
oh I know where something went it went

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,330
into an apps cluster on GAE in Iowa

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,190
that's a whole naming standard exercise

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,920
because you have multiple clusters for

00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,910
example we'll see that I know that up

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,910
someone's still complaining about

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,690
something I can go write the day dog all

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:57,000
right so developer experience handled

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:58,770
experience handled now with that for

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,380
those who've been like an OP I've been a

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,780
dev a sec and an OP I've had the

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:07,800
experience of having three new relic

00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:12,300
tabs and a sumo tab tab up and Amazon

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,830
tab up an azure tab up why if I had a

00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,530
software delivery control plane I guess

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,930
see all that in two tabs which means

00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,430
that stress there of managing that

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,980
experience across all different views

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,090
goes away which mean there's less tedium

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,310
and quicker resolution I want my first

00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,290
jobs I was the Air Force I played around

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,360
with blend things up some people's first

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,100
job and software it was oh I worked on

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,330
this game on the website we do I was the

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,360
precision strikes both doing wind

00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,790
blowing

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,610
I watched him in a small damn bomb four

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,050
times go on the ground and not blow up

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,910
but there's a thing there called test

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,870
saturation that all pilots have they

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,850
have multiple different things are

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:53,500
trying to accomplish and that's why is

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:56,680
actually a trade secret why the Raptor

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,110
f-22 f-35 and a European fighter are all

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,080
single man because there's there's like

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,270
two decades of research of how do I have

00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,720
the pilot not think about flying and

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,310
think about kill kill kill the enemy so

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,980
the same thing here if I have that

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,650
software delivery control plane and see

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,300
her Buckeye link I have collapsed all

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,800
the tedium of trying to see what would

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,080
happen in my enterprise and my solution

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,050
deployed across multiple clusters which

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,820
means I don't have way up then they call

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,830
a hot helmet but that set the saturation

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,170
overload which would mean when something

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,930
goes on goes wrong immediately know in

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,110
1020 seconds where it is and how I deal

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,700
with it and I couldn't find a spinnaker

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,980
this company doesn't make Spinnaker's to

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,400
pull container ships oh that's close I

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,720
can get

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:47,920
so yeah and finally why why spinnaker

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,110
developer enablement because we want to

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,390
be able to do all the things about all

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,520
the support tickets because right there

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,260
in spinnaker bushel I'll show later if

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,850
you know nothing about Cuban aids but

00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,170
you can build a docker file you can

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,910
deploy something to kubernetes without

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,660
asking someone to do something will get

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,920
it that because you really want and I

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,650
mentioned earlier in the hurdle to beat

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,110
cloud cubicle we do all the great things

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,340
the best packaging and of course you

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,110
don't want to do some today analysis to

00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,640
we'll talk about that issue that you

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:20,310
want to be repeatable and difficult

00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:22,360
every day all day which is right oh yeah

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,440
spinnaker see if it's hard to deploy

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,810
okay I hear that a lot but you do enough

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,710
times it's not so I started the you know

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,690
what you talk about is easy

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:35,220
oh well yeah I guess it did take me a

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,450
little while to get into going okay but

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,390
part of us thought we want to enable

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,580
immediate value delivery for your

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,860
enterprise for you like if you ask me to

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,870
use spinnaker now I like I just by a

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,190
default I have kubernetes I deploy

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,279
sprinted and do any go do you in tear

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,050
all down

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:55,959
so ah that's why I want to get to you

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,399
let's talk about this thing it's an open

00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,649
source project it's basically the result

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,510
of making spinach or easy to deploy

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:03,459
right like it's so easy

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,500
Oh a min no it's not so let's go package

00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:08,680
up something that makes it seem so easy

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,220
to do so what is it

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,110
it's about disposable containers livery

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,940
environments event things are actually

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,190
easy to do and useful it should be to

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,899
throw it away it's like when something

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,940
breaks she's good Amazon buy a new one

00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,529
if you don't care right I was kind of

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,410
sad that's why there's a big plastic

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,510
island in the Pacific but it's about

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,029
creating disposable KATUSA living

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,070
environments in under 30 minutes no I

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,260
didn't say create ticket go ask somebody

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:39,570
we're talking about getting spinnaker on

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:42,070
kubernetes in the cloud in 30 minutes

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:45,070
these are so many pieces well we'll see

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:47,769
this we'll see this now what is capstan

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,660
it's it demonstrates several things a

00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:51,670
sort of the outcropping of problems that

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,810
as consultants that we deal with the

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:57,100
enterprise dealing with how can we

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:59,079
package it up so what does code could

00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,459
look like in this context well we're

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,410
going to use terraform because um all

00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:04,630
the time and then we're sort of

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,459
indirectly talk about mutable

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,680
infrastructure so if you as Enterprise

00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:10,300
one that have eyeballs and there's

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,839
something that looks like that that's an

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,750
example of that we explicitly slow show

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,730
tool configurations so there's some

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,490
unimpressive like bash in some places

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,660
that completely show you what's going on

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,220
and it's focused blowing on containers

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,490
like it's not gonna help you build VM

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:32,079
instances in Google or Amazon is really

00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:34,329
focused on using containers now what

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,430
does it do oh how is actually used for

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,990
those who use it developer seller ation

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,339
I got mentioned earlier one of my

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,360
hurdles for doing all the right things

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:45,370
is using containers in the cloud but my

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,089
development of nodejs guys is like they

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:54,220
don't have to worry about that oh is

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:55,209
this sound good or okay yeah don't want

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,829
to have to worry about that well

00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,510
actually we'll see that and if interest

00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:59,890
good I'll demonstrate just taking a nap

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,520
and put it and buy a little bouncer and

00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,870
holiday in about four minutes if you can

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,390
do

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,830
dr. build you should be able to push

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,529
that makrooh Bernays like a new duck a

00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,300
build admin Cooper days no picking out

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,040
Cooper Nene's predictor and all that

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,279
good stuff getting all together should

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,100
be able to that developer sandbox so for

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,170
example that picture was actually

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,150
working on using UC oh I need a place to

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,760
play SEO but I don't want to have to go

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:29,130
like do you have an app develop use SEO

00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,900
I don't have to care about doing cute

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,730
cuddly amethyst all day I just want a

00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,370
plain click because I'm late lazy unlike

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,500
pictures so another example would be

00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,900
lets say you are receiving sales data

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,790
all day you have a lot of retail

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,500
retailers who receive the cells daily

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,240
weekly week data trying to figure out

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,040
what the due to weak data they have

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,570
someone using cube flow there's someone

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,980
that make a user experience then they

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,510
put it together somewhere that's

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,940
something you can go do now so we have

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,320
that sales data comes in weekly someone

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,270
could make a user experience that goes

00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,020
trigger some ml out action in cube flow

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,400
as an example as an experiment because

00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:06,449
developer acceleration went to an able

00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,699
the creative process curse it

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:11,760
illustrates bootstrapping I go from

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,850
nothing to cluster plus posture I

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,040
created plus B they're pushing apples oh

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,470
how could I do this myself

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,449
so if you look that capstan you play the

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,640
finger oh well this isn't this is

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,920
generic but I'll change this step I'll

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,130
change this step and then mold it to my

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,380
enterprise that is in 30 minutes

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,650
the function CD environment on

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,800
kubernetes how do i dissect that to make

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,570
it match my enterprise and of course ops

00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,490
training like i'll be doing this effort

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,929
is talk they the environment I'm going

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,240
to show you has a certificate that's

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,890
gonna expire soon so I'm going to do the

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,510
experiment of Oh Wally update the

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,280
cluster and heating up the spinnaker I

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,070
have this vanilla environment I created

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,870
in 30 minutes let me update it oh I must

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,610
uh weld me burn all down start over I

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,380
can do like four or five experiments in

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,390
one day right instead of a super

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,010
expensive I asked five people to build

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,140
me an environment they go do upgrade

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,870
test I created in three minutes

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,440
hope that didn't work blow away do it

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:13,140
again so the one that's out now is DCP

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,240
so yum all the time we use terraform so

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,490
from your box all you need really is get

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,610
terraform ng

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,010
loud and then he do apply and it'll

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,279
create all the pieces itself and then

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,630
I'll give you a Tools VM and then sure

00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,120
on the side show you the answer cool

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,640
about using ansible is battery how they

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,740
deploy jenkins using helm so you'll see

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,390
stuff and places to where I could do all

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,190
these ham charts now but we'll just do

00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:42,630
Jenkins and then you'll see it deploys

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:45,270
spinnaker using halyard how does it work

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:49,799
Google cloud trial count your $300 a

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:52,700
free I've been there's there's some

00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,080
steps you follow it's all and readme

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,279
actually you validate your GZ be account

00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,440
sure they're proceeding of chickens your

00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:59,610
accountant going to be useful

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,230
of course someone could probably

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:06,029
automate that too and why say under 30

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,220
minutes if you're doing the vanilla

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:11,039
version without DNS TLS they're off to

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,220
set up we're talking a 60 minutes 14

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,880
minutes 13 minutes if spin Oracle

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,049
bootstraps taking forever 20 minutes so

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,610
it's actually less than 30 minutes

00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,159
someone ever want to stop for a moment

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:25,340
and say I get to have a container I see

00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:28,919
the environment in 60 minutes

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,870
alright ah so the fun part we're gonna

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,690
demo here we're going to show you the W

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,740
environment some pipelines there

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,120
actually believe it or not we're working

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,370
on getting you pipelines out the door

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,590
also so that's actually coming so not

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,750
only do you have an environment up with

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,799
CCI CD and kubernetes actual pipelines

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,210
created I'm actually gonna show you a a

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,250
pre-release branch they're doing testing

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,590
on that actually has the canary stuff in

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,270
it mmm you're gonna hear talk later

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,370
about about canary you actually get to

00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,919
see a pipeline of canary configured with

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,470
an app you can play with and direction

00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,820
to say go this line is at create a big

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,520
ray of bigdecimal

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,990
just to like the sumo butcher am alright

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,880
and then we'll come back to the

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,010
enterprise to be started talking about

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,350
the enterprise problems and then we're

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,990
gonna talk about after this experience

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,980
of creating environments cheaply and

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,390
quickly being able to do a couple things

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:26,850
for an enterprise now going back to

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:31,039
enterprise if I made alright what was

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:37,049
your name Greg made

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:38,460
it's cheap to make environments now put

00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,450
yourself in the enterprise he'll be

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,169
sprawling global businesses they sell

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:48,330
shirts and sneakers and electronics

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:49,619
well what's also going on is people

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,679
trying to figure out how to orchestrate

00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:55,169
their enterprise at the macro level I

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,919
actually do not like ITU Sam but I love

00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:01,499
ServiceNow so if I could make an

00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,690
environment creation cheap I could

00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:06,629
prototype build out an environment

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:09,029
builder and then when a developer wants

00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:11,159
an environment oh yeah they go into

00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:12,960
servers now ask for an environment maybe

00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,049
you make an elaborate and say pull this

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,059
stack of apps then ask this environment

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:20,190
builder create that environment and go

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:23,129
pushed out pipelines that deploy those

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,349
apps and then since I connected it with

00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:27,149
the 'greater Enterprise for resource

00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:30,239
management I can say oh yeah by the way

00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:31,889
after two weeks serves now go blow that

00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:35,039
away because that's burning without NAS

00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:38,489
day so I made environment creation cheap

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:42,929
oh whoa I'm sorry Greg Greg

00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:46,739
and she works a tab list I've been

00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:49,649
harassing her Aleta could make

00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:51,389
environment creation cheap that mean

00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:54,419
your developers not obstructed cuz well

00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:56,460
early on I mentioned part of why

00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,580
spinnaker is awesome cause you'll be

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,139
able to enable developers to do things

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,169
you'll be able your enterprise go do

00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:05,399
things so you're gonna show your well I

00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,509
guess you could still show a slide to

00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,979
the enterprise oh yeah we're gonna do

00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:09,929
this orchestration thing Vander Prize

00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:11,759
and then we're able developers at the

00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,429
same time and ServiceNow like you could

00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,700
let Church like several main dollars but

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:19,019
one thing here is I can orchestrate the

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,509
building of environments for my

00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:23,869
developers so they they can go to lunch

00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:27,239
or come back already something like that

00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:28,979
then it's that notification also for

00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:31,229
enterprise provision everywhere

00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:33,929
we can't it had a previous life of doing

00:22:31,229 --> 00:22:35,700
stuff for stores i q-- believe that

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,639
cubed all the things and I have this app

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,889
that says look up customer info and then

00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:42,570
locally each store it knows who comes to

00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:44,009
store often so it knows all that people

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,500
come to store so it caches the people at

00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:47,110
that store all

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,760
right boys the same at three different

00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,920
places the same look up at running in

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,690
the web store front in the cloud it's a

00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,160
same app sitting on top but there's ap

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,020
business we're housed inside the

00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,150
enterprise cuz they pay lots of money

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,250
for that so it's not going away and then

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,800
add all the stores and then even at at

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,800
this store of the gas station if they're

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,480
not Windows CE e Diebold gas pumps that

00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,850
drift from time and credit card

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,010
transactions fail across America oh wait

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:16,060
I'm sorry I gave too much too much away

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:19,510
sorry baby you're finally replacing

00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,100
those with more IOT like gas pumps now

00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,080
they're they don't do the transaction at

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,330
the pump anymore sometimes in the store

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,950
or say mobile mobile gateway and I go

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,440
somewhere that still needs to be

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,840
provisioned if you think about that as

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,580
the gas station has devices and maybe in

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,170
a mobile mobile gateway there's also

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,720
like a test low of all those sensors

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:41,620
rolling around those like an oil rig I

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,840
was like at McDonald's so here for

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,650
spinnaker if I have that one amp because

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,540
I'm looking at I can see in seconds

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,610
remember earlier I knew in seconds how

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,920
something was going I could see what

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,110
version was pushed out everywhere and

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,650
then if I'm really really sexy really

00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,350
smart

00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,330
I can canary to a store I can have a

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,880
store and he's getting update I could

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:07,060
canary lease it to that one store so I

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,800
have a pride priest or canary push to

00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,600
that one store or someone's Tesla in the

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,850
middle the day while the driving screen

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,360
goes blank

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:18,490
I do it to that one store all that pass

00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,520
no push it all stores push the story

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,690
stores in Spain and South Korea and

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,530
United Kingdom

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,330
Mexico Puerto Rico Canada and holiday

00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,100
and the no one's complaining this is

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,260
very important for example if you care

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,100
about CBS for example I have some app

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,620
that was built

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,080
maybe these store has to be functional I

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,020
may be processing transactions in that

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,520
store there's a flawless and package I

00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,650
need to be able to push it out

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,800
everywhere I want to canary that and

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:51,400
make sure I didn't a store okay

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,679
that's TVs now now ruler worldwide so

00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,020
for the enterprise with that single

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,730
software delivery control plane notice

00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,149
I'm not talking about doing builds and

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,669
stuff

00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:02,379
but I also gonna talk about for a single

00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:09,459
software delivery control plane plus

00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:12,629
that with the link custom links was her

00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:14,889
name Emily Emily and our custom links

00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:16,599
are you be able to see what happened cuz

00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,699
you could actually that could actually

00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:20,289
uh you can have you know the daemon set

00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:22,209
for a day dog deployed everywhere else

00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:24,909
oh so you have that one monitoring

00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:30,159
logging to your oh so with the custom

00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:32,829
linker is the Emily now for start

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,009
fishing up here I'm almost done it's

00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:37,299
open source so this is me finally

00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:39,789
ranting because I've been seeing it

00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:41,439
around the office that you know what

00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:44,109
this should be asked with playbooks

00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:46,059
that's they told you met thing to do

00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:48,429
guess what that's left there as the

00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:52,149
exercise for the student I'm not going

00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:54,279
to do that it's working now and me and

00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:55,809
Nando developer will cliff at Ken's and

00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:57,009
we can't go on back up no we should

00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:00,489
change to playable change the play both

00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:02,639
chained to play books well you see here

00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:05,739
our text is done in bash for

00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:09,039
accessibility so people can go do it but

00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:10,959
really to professionalize it for your

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,819
enterprise you will revisit it and go

00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:16,719
this is yum all the time

00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:17,559
maybe we should be instable playbooks oh

00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,939
yeah

00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:22,419
talk about this is coming next this is

00:26:18,939 --> 00:26:24,309
actually an old version to read me blame

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,499
when I heard about you KS you'll be able

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:27,909
to have example of actual canary

00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:29,979
pipeline thank you several pipelines

00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:33,069
sort of walk through of theirs initial

00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:34,629
one here's one that uses triggers but

00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:37,239
here's the one that does the canary and

00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:39,849
then the readme seriously it says and

00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:42,489
there's a pre using go major enormous

00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:46,289
array so it consumes robust ram so will

00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:47,919
fail the canary and that's about it

00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:50,019
thank you

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,529
hope I didn't speak too fast you slow

00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,529
