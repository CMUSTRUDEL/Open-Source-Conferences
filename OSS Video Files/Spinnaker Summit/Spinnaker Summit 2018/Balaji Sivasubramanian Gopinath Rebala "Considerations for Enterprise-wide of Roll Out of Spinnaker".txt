00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,720
so this talk is about some of the design

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,510
consideration if you want to roll out

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,369
spinnaker you know from one deployment

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,560
to enterprise-wide

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,910
and you know it's all the requirement on

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,830
the design constitutions we were going

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,480
to talk about he's going to address you

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,860
know either you're a single deployment

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,739
or multiple deployments but it's still a

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,190
very useful conversation here now so my

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:46,110
name is Balaji siva and products at op

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,820
cements and go peanut is our CTO adopts

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,129
the max so for people who are not

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,960
committed officer max we are you know

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,090
pending said already company we offer

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,289
ten things one is the open source of

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,969
connector support you know if you're

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,350
looking to do it's not guarantee once

00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,910
it's open so let me do it

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,010
we also have an enterprise spinnaker

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,250
which offers a layer of value add on top

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,229
of the open source spinnaker and we also

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,369
have something called autopilot which

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:14,100
brings a I or England's engine to the

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,830
seeding process so we're at we're right

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,189
opposite a store outside and if you have

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,770
any questions you can ask yourself so in

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,229
this talk we'll talk about that sort of

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,619
review the enterprise needs we have seen

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,619
from

00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:36,700
spiritual users and asking what they are

00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,830
it is no surprise what what the needs

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,750
are and then we'll talk about whether

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,300
you have the DS ready how do you go

00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,280
about designing the spinnaker to meet

00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,450
those needs we will talk about briefly

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:54,010
about writing a you want to look at

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:56,860
after you've done the deployments so so

00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:00,850
in the beginning the requirements

00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,590
perspective obviously having we should I

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:06,310
was in CDs and mission-critical for most

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,840
of you because L are deploying in this

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,340
beatty age developers are deploying all

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,940
the time and you want to be able to have

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,560
highly available you know basically a CD

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,600
this is generally CD not not

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,820
specifically spinnaker now is he scale

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,200
in terms of and particularly video

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,450
you'll be rolling out to a large

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,030
enterprise why do you need to be able to

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,050
support different types of dollars I'm

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,260
going to support it for a number of

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,880
pipelines for a number of users etc so

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,050
that becomes an important thing another

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,970
thing I want to talk about another thing

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,850
is very important for reliability is

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,460
obviously how even supporting the

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,880
spinnaker itself

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,880
grow

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,210
the inspector is great in providing

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,340
automated releases obviously from

00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,280
quarter to quarter is one of the

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,870
recurring themes I'm hearing from users

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,480
is that I want to have a little ceremony

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,400
process I want you to automatically

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,710
today there you know when you want to go

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,690
over any update for example it takes you

00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:04,440
know it takes like a human intervention

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,540
it takes readings and how did x to do

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,580
all of that so this really helps us to

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,160
do this is watching a requirement that

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,720
people have the other one that I've seen

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,370
director agrees that on open-source

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,320
maintainer there are certain

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,410
organizations right now the open source

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,750
portion if I can get an open source that

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,959
would be more for all sorts of ocean I

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,430
think this is something you see

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,209
requirements perspective anything from

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,040
the developer app apps prospects from

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,390
the CDA requirement is basically able to

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,300
do so sir

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,890
if you are go an application to people

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,500
the developers can get up and running

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,750
and starting to point a petition the use

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,989
of tickets and getting different things

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,040
done it is really it's it's sort of the

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,989
nothing anymore

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,290
there's I mean how to pull one or more

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,090
more self-service andalusia support

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,250
various types of application small with

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,250
micro services you know different types

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,739
of applications you know with multiple

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,000
dependency in fill in those applications

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,130
and so then you can roll out in the

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,530
stage fashion that's also not a big

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,650
requirement and increment deployment

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,850
needs perspective what we are seeing is

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,959
you know how does the multi-cloud in

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,410
particular States

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,410
there's also need for enterprise in

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,030
legacy environments yes the request for

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,700
be spear or bear member

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,290
other requirements you know at the end

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,600
of day people are able to roll out one

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,000
CD solution right you want to be able to

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,440
do once a solution so that even if you

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,970
have an app that look at the component

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,160
you want to deploy in one single script

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:44,350
for days in this case it's a simple

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:47,140
process so that's a obviously the whole

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,630
safe deployment zero down the peerless

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,520
load is obviously table stakes the

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,960
pieces that sort of you can be more

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,760
about renewal of the pod already

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,520
something that they really require is

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,200
around verification of interest that

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,900
speech now that you're applying it speed

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,090
how do I verify these things not only

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,800
for Canada now this is just one part of

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,720
it I've done the cannery but I know

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,180
aren't too approving or rolling update

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,640
analysis because that's sort of so the

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,160
next stage of evolution of analysis

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,960
because the production of the analysis

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,850
shouldn't stop just because it is the

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,400
Kennedy and now you know what works

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,050
right you've seen many cases where you

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,030
have to do all back because something

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,100
happens in production that you didn't

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,890
catch you know properly in Canada for

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,419
example so ability to do those analysis

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,810
also is a very critical one yes session

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:36,810
later today

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:47,969
and like I said yes monkey chaos monkey

00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,969
in addition I think and we talked about

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,229
but how do you measure the reliability

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,879
now that it cause think that the answer

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,830
should have me okay to fail to not fail

00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,580
but you know how does how does the

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:05,289
performance is changing what chaos being

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,629
introduced something you're going to

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,490
have the chaos obsession so how do you

00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:11,860
you know there's a beacon it says making

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,930
the service fail rating but you won't be

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,389
able to be a little more granular in

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:21,340
terms of analysis the last part is

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:22,719
actually for audit and the good news of

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,699
course maker is that everything it was

00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:29,080
knowledgeable right you want me to the

00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,750
requirement has been that along with

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,610
know who deploy why they deployed when

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,020
they require who approval it powers them

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,360
in that's important also the policy or

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,729
as you go from a small group and now to

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,500
a like thousand Apple users or the apps

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:46,569
you need you do have a centralized

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,169
policy so that you can import all these

00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,219
policies

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:52,659
I do policies for all the developers in

00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:56,379
an automated fashion you don't want to

00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:57,879
be able to put a blockers everywhere so

00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:59,289
that people have to call you to do

00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,110
anything right and you want to be able

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,550
to automate their application so things

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,870
that on compliance is actually more

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,849
important right you don't want people

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,080
deploying in wrong places or people

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,330
doing things that they're not supposed

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,729
to do is supposed to follow a certain

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,379
source code analysis security analysis

00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,879
except I've before to you or deployment

00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,639
you don't want people start commenting

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,570
that so when you put vinegar with more

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,550
sort of controls you

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:28,960
how do you sort equipment you've heard

00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:31,980
many times over and and you know in this

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,390
talk we'll try to address some of these

00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:37,210
how do you go over okay those are the

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,160
record general reconnaissance matter

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,160
actually you can take an existing tools

00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,840
and scripts and genican CI extensions

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,400
except I could get it but you know

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,250
you're really not going to get the scale

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,130
or the true CD it's going to be still be

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,340
broken you can also look at proprietary

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:57,100
tools are some tools available that but

00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,650
he kind of goes against the open-source

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,920
mandate is one of the things that told

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:05,350
us and also it gets expensive it's

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,960
locking the never callosity we take

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,270
obviously we are spinnaker Cricut so we

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,110
think that you know spinnaker is a great

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:17,500
open source tool it has a high velocity

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,410
contributors if you look at going back

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,760
to the enterprise needs is you know many

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,110
of the spinnaker checks do any of these

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,300
things right there are maybe some

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,550
additional things that you need to put

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,090
around it but the maker provides the

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,660
ability to really get all of these

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,460
banners and I'd also like to what we do

00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,419
is help some of the customs bridge that

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,729
gap and

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,019
for example some driver you know like I

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,980
have OpenStack but I have something

00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:48,709
missing or what's that I don't have any

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:51,290
spirit driver reload we get that or how

00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:52,880
do i do audio a deposit it's okay

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,760
spinnaker is the core and you want to

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,529
use it but I do started allowing you may

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,779
need additional things and we're happy

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:02,449
to help

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,889
so there's a talk obviously we talk

00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:08,680
about general requirements obviously

00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:11,149
there's a large enterprise Cisco that

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,240
actually went through this journey in

00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:17,329
employed from CD one narrow to vinegar

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,779
1500 applications when I roll out GA in

00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:23,209
the next three weeks so they're gonna

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,540
talk about what lesson they learn we

00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:28,399
help them push it and again you can

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,070
learn more in that session as well so

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,120
it's a 3:30 today but that I'm gonna

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:39,160
pass on or Chicopee is going to go to a

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,160
lot of technical details on how

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,600
thank you

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,210
- body right - some of the requirements

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,510
are generally custody they can see it

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:58,930
all from enterprises so now that we

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,920
decided to move in spinnaker it meets

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,920
Department

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:17,170
microservices architecture it can span

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:19,510
across regions provides for an

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,310
organization some really large

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,980
organization which each department

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,400
having different so you have a good

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,770
option

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,790
one is to have a centralized system

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,940
spinning across region society but

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,590
centrally controlled in terms of policy

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,570
and the features they provide with

00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,450
respect is vinegar - entire augmentation

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,840
or you can have a smaller deployments to

00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,880
each one of the departments some of them

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,250
because of their compliance requirements

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,120
or just ease of use and give more

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,120
self-service to

00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:55,480
so then you need to have some of the

00:11:48,410 --> 00:12:03,680
small customers say the radius execution

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:11,380
paths are also pipeline and application

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,380
here I've served you can use s3 storage

00:12:49,040 --> 00:13:12,380
you have on the 500

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,930
every organization because of their

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,630
integrations there are some complexities

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:04,930
there are specific so we automate that

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,240
process so that in this version when

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:17,860
everything is released make sure that is

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:19,899
working the deployment yourself using

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,020
Tolyatti tasks will be in departments in

00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:26,430
a distributed system that's great

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,430
one of the things that you have to

00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,529
though some considerations in if you

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,080
have the other ways of doing it

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:50,390
giving update but you have to then just

00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:53,390
slightly differently if you could use a

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,390
slightly

00:15:28,080 --> 00:16:03,720
but if you have some customers even like

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,750
zero now we want to use some other

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,350
systems like we do at all then you come

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,350
to us and say

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:32,110
in this onboarding again the security

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:37,000
divisions there are many different types

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:39,370
pivots of course variations enterprises

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,830
mostly have Annapolis Active Directory

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:46,240
stuff and they also have two factor

00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:49,450
authentication some of the access

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,380
management of the spinnaker has a lot of

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,110
different of those you need to look at

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,240
what will enterprise account I saw what

00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,650
kind of all back at one go back to the

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,510
user

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,160
we know that with that and spinning at

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,839
requirements to make the decisions on

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,699
how are you wanting to date and how we

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:11,980
want to our security access to include a

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:15,240
pipeline school and change the Lifeline

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,240
instructor and

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,000
so you pick and choose those others

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:42,110
applications that can easily market you

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:47,830
they didn't have some help with and

00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:47,830
providing the temples and you also

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:28,300
we want to update this so today their

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,800
provides pipeline stages you could use

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:44,820
some of those say in my pipeline

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:44,820
pipeline but even have staged migration

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:34,740
laughter issues is how many ability to

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:43,710
see the improvements in the system to be

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:43,710
able to measure and also on this as

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,190
collect all the events will change when

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,340
you you can take this even further

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:09,790
compliance eating instead of

00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:12,000
management's so these are patterns that

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,000
you

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,039
[Music]

00:21:30,650 --> 00:22:09,320
so the adios if the five lines are the

00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,320
changes

00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:41,759
these laws are so in the moderator

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:45,749
identification you should also consider

00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:52,339
having long analysis for the unicorns

00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:52,339
you take it ordinance existing system

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:39,730
you'll awaken and dynamics I think you

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,710
know going back to the previous slide

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,420
right I think the part that's

00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:48,150
interesting is that if you are doing a

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:50,890
rolling update so Canidae is obviously

00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,270
you've done 1% whatever but really

00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,490
people are but the Covenant is

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,280
particularly right east you think I am

00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,710
very popular and you want to be able to

00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,700
analyzed in a rolling fashion understand

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,220
20% 30% 40% there will be integration

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,740
thing coming with this deal with

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,780
natively with the who's the spinnaker

00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,200
but you want to be able to analyze it

00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:18,190
and be able to actively control that

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:22,200
deployment be able to all that you know

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,200
to revert the version

00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,570
after a certain percentage

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,150
all-or-nothing of the applications

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,800
so what officer max does I think you

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,150
know it's maybe a little plug for us is

00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,490
that if you do a lot of these things

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:41,190
right ends up I'll provide these things

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,830
but we provide these laws in ATM and

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,140
houses you do is your analysis we do

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,050
back analysis attracts it from that's

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,670
sort of where we think if you're

00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,190
deploying at speed you want to be able

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:56,460
to do all of those takes to get better

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,380
analysis so I think the last but not

00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,850
least is actually the support of the

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,560
spinnaker so I think if you're doing

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,470
internal support which I think a lot of

00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,720
people are doing you know make sure you

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,060
have some dedicated teams what I think

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,970
the challenge obviously is maintaining

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:14,220
the team or a period of time you want to

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,730
be able to the team has to be able to

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,960
support in a 24 by 7 if that's your

00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,250
operational model particularly if you

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,630
have to all the first across the globe

00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,860
it becomes a very highly challenging

00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:27,690
situation and another issues because the

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,680
you know there are a lot of bugs that

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,540
you run into and and asking community to

00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,520
fix is gonna take a long time right I

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,560
mean it'll take its time but you know

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,480
it's not gonna be quick so you want to

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,760
be able to be able to have ability to

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,720
understand the source course and be able

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,000
to request

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,300
I guess there's an Andy thing maybe you

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,300
wanna be

00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:52,500
the other other part is to support the

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,470
commercial support I think in another

00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,080
plug off that my company does

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,040
open-source support you can even you

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,420
know with the spinnaker you can

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,880
obviously have a vendor version so you

00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:06,390
have vendors the big version and also

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,240
just auto open source you want to choose

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,340
which are you comfortable and I think

00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,960
the most vendors like ourselves we can

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,120
fix some critical issues for our

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,210
customers yes something that's broken

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,110
that that you're reading or 26 we can

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,580
try to help you out

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,640
and also there's also features I think

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,350
we talked about where end-users have

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,290
come to us and say I don't know elevator

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,120
I have to eat it all right for OpenStack

00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,880
for example there's nothing there or

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,790
somebody said hey I have easy ask but I

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,460
don't use easy are I used a bar or

00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:41,010
industry there's no support for that

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,810
he's gonna think you're high hey if I

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,610
was available you artifacts to put a

00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,740
little for ADA because why not available

00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,600
for easy yeah well the thing is that if

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,580
all of these drivers are doubled by you

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,500
knew your customers like you know and

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:57,480
users like Target and lookout it is yes

00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,570
so they've developed it for their use

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,000
case so you're not doing it for again

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,300
global just give that so you want to be

00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,470
aware of those things and and I think

00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,420
some of the support vendors could help

00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:12,390
you with that

00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:14,070
I think just to summarize you know

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,630
there's many points that go be talked

00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,630
about we do you have a plenty of time to

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,100
ask you a and I think we left a bit pit

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,810
up time so that because these questions

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,400
are not you know you should ask

00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,710
questions because you're actually trying

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,990
to do

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:31,610
and having these questions so please ask

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:33,950
them you can answer for you also you

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,869
know you want to be able to have a test

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,759
in Robin just summarize I just have that

00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:39,860
piston on an anthology the spinnaker

00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,450
before you go to the next word I think

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,350
something that that we have seen it very

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,450
useful

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,919
well they have an app onboarding and

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,519
scaling you know you want to be able to

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,919
provide this cell service concept with

00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:53,720
beginner and advanced templates these

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,139
are something that we are seen working

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,309
actively for large organization where

00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:00,259
they don't know you it's a larger idea

00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:03,230
organization and people don't know who

00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:04,429
you are when I deploy and respect your

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,840
life like I said I understand

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,759
interesting features make sure that you

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,460
understand that and and you kind of try

00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,440
to roll out and definitely you know if

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,029
you are mature enough to gone past the

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,649
initial development stance you want to

00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:19,009
consider some sort of verification

00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:22,309
mechanism you know like doing rollout

00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:23,629
and removing or even staging audio in in

00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:25,940
production you want to do a condensed

00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:29,559
for educational pill releases and in

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:34,009
fact like to take care of production

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:36,169
reliability analysis and the audit and

00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:38,570
compliance I think spinnaker is awesome

00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:39,889
and it has all the events available for

00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,200
you to audit I think this is absolutely

00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:45,499
a must for any are you looking going to

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,960
production I don't see any people would

00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:49,129
be not okay to have that you have that

00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,399
but you know you have to go to your own

00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:54,259
so how are we can help you I think the

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,600
other part is that our manager

00:30:54,259 --> 00:31:01,580
which i think is useful again to lock

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,529
down your pipeline as well as be able to

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,330
do if some quality trading happens you

00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:07,609
are able to actually make a change

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:11,169
globally and then it automates

00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:14,090
automatically updates of the pipeline's

00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:16,220
lock last part we want to do is okay now

00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,379
that you have deployed it you know you

00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,019
have supposed to have all these benefits

00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:22,840
you know you have this velocity now you

00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:25,009
have organizational efficiency

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,580
probability accept that you have reduced

00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:30,470
cost using open source but you wanna be

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,570
able to measure some of this axis right

00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:34,460
how do you measure them these are some

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,499
of things some of the clients have done

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,389
is basically like out of use your

00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:41,450
deployment success or increase velocity

00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:43,909
right you know how frequently do I

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,639
deploy now than before right you know

00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:50,899
typically if you're using descripting

00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:54,070
and other things it's gonna you're gonna

00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:57,049
get a five 10x improvement compared to

00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,269
compared to you know the spinnaker right

00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:01,279
and you won't be able to look at how

00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:04,190
many Russian pages have reduced now that

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,929
you're doing this education move it like

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:08,090
you know has your production roll backs

00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:09,980
of reduce because you now have the sail

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,989
years because you're doing better Canada

00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,340
analysis and rid of things before maybe

00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:17,270
you using manual

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,530
this robot robots you know thinking they

00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,660
look at all the metrics all the time

00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,640
maybe you know do pick it out

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,740
I love the incline that we pop they want

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,930
to reduce like a significant percentage

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,370
of production ten years with this kind

00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:32,180
of analysis you know like significant

00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:34,730
like ninety outages ninety eight years

00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:37,280
or quarter and a number of quote they

00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,560
won't reduce ethical and then obviously

00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,600
you want to know how are you better off

00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,880
now that that you have deployed it and

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,050
now you're able to recover from failure

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,840
other criteria for metals IQ is that how

00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,760
fastening are getting on board it it

00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,130
used to be like months whatever or days

00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,480
weeks whatever no no it's a good thing

00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,250
for you to go to report to your boss and

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,280
say hey you know what listen I rolled it

00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:04,610
out and now I'm able to get all these

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,230
benefits also the ability to diagnose

00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:09,770
production failures like you know for

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:11,660
example ACA is an example of you know

00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,670
you have some feedback from the failure

00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,380
that's happening in Canada with officer

00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,090
next we have these failures for idiots

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,920
others take this as well so you provide

00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,300
you some super diagnostic feedback with

00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,340
the developer can say okay you know what

00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,840
this ails because of these reasons so

00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,310
this is something you can you can see

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,010
you know doesn't really help the top

00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:30,800
feedback loop between developers and and

00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:33,140
the deployment and then obviously your

00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,750
cost reduction this could be time save

00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,670
could be your licensing cost no longer

00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,410
being there you know those are big

00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,890
packet one of the one of the client is

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:46,160
paying of 1.2 million dollars a year on

00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:48,080
an IBM products right and now they're

00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,309
leo wow this is like one tenth of the

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,789
cop even in the floor

00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:54,830
being there nice and then you know

00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:56,990
success metrics you want obviously this

00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,330
is more for your own tracking you know

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,399
it's like how reliable is your services

00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,950
because you could as a dumb down time

00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:07,009
it's going to affect all the all the

00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,899
users all the developers and then able

00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:10,369
to do so keep track of how many

00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,020
applications where you're gonna get on

00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:15,349
border and what time so it set some

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,210
goals for example you know like hey you

00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:19,099
know I have told an application that I

00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:21,109
want to be able to get X number of

00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,879
applications by this court or that order

00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:25,639
what can you do to help you know the

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:28,069
templating may help maybe migration

00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,480
tools can help you know you can do

00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:32,570
building things to kind of get that goal

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,119
but having that goal is sort of useful

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,179
