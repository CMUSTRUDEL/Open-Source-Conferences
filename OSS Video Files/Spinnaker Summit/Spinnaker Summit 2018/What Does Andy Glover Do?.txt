00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:11,070
I'm the director of delivery engineering

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,860
we are charged with enabling Netflix's

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,369
competitive advantage of speed through

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,380
continuous delivery so we essentially

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,090
own and operate spinnaker at Netflix

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,880
spinnaker is well known as a you know

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,840
continuous delivery platform to AWS but

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,060
Netflix has more than one environment so

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,309
obviously we leverage AWS but we also

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,399
have our own container cloud called

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,860
Titus we also have probably the largest

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,450
CDN or second largest let's say I think

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,350
actually YouTube is larger than us which

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,809
is called open connect and so spinnaker

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,090
is also delivering firmware to that so

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,270
we do have a multi cloud environment of

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,160
Netflix and again that's what my team

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,170
does is listen to those stakeholders

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,879
understand their use cases and ensure

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:02,090
that they can develop or they can

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:07,220
deliver or affect code code delivery

00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,220
rapid reliably safely securely

00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,230
