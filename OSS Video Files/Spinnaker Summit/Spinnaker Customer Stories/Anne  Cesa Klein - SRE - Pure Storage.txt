hey it's rodeo CEO at armory and I am

00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,060
here with an why don't you introduce

00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,890
yourself I'm Angie as a Klein I'm a site

00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,530
reliability engineer at pier storage

00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,600
okay so let's talk spinnaker tell us a

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,060
little bit about where pure storages and

00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,650
your spinnaker journeys so this is

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,230
actually our second spinnaker summit

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,360
we're very happy to be here again also

00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,910
enforced this time we've been using

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,920
spinnaker for over a year we are almost

00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,590
completely cynic arrives in terms of our

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,840
adoption across all of our services

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,060
incredible so you were very early

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,560
adopters where what was it about

00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,090
spinnaker that first caught your

00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,500
attention how did you learn about it and

00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,410
we'll talk a little bit about how you

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,750
made the decisions so so if your stories

00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,450
were really a data driven company right

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,160
so we're very focused on analyzing where

00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,620
our issues are they found that we were

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,600
seeing a lot of issues in that that

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,309
critical sort of pipeline deployment

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,680
where we getting consistent builds out

00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:00,290
where we deploying the same thing

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,899
everywhere yeah and then we also had

00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,100
problems with roll backs so that was

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,139
what we're trying to solve

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,060
did you evaluate other other

00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:10,009
technologies other platforms or other

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,069
approaches whether it's a you know spit

00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,450
polish and tape or some other platform

00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:16,159
we've been using multiple Ashley's

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,700
different teams that all come up with

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,709
their own solutions right so yes there's

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,869
not a B before there was no and there's

00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:26,509
no mandate to use spinnaker either

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:27,859
the team's really have seen the benefits

00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,270
it's provided they've really come

00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,439
towards it

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,909
you know it's so interesting to see that

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,159
happening in many companies obviously

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:38,210
Netflix has that approaches right and

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,100
Netflix their whole culture is to to say

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,630
you don't have to use the Golden Path

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,640
but you're gonna own it yeah if you

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,219
don't is it the same instead we got the

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,039
guardrails that Netflix ought to be out

00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:53,359
having the guardrail really not gates

00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:55,759
exactly not so much we encourage people

00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,530
go that way but but we don't we don't

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,560
dictate it either but what we are doing

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,899
is withdrawing support for others the

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,869
service is using a different mechanism

00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:07,909
we can't we can't provide the SLA all

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,979
right but if it's using spinnaker hey

00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:13,569
we've got that response time we know how

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,950
to roll back we can fix it faster so

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:17,750
something that we talk to many companies

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,010
about and if I'm a cloud architect

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,200
watching this and let's say that I'm

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,390
responsible for the cloud transformation

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,310
journey of my company the onboarding of

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,200
applications onto the platform is always

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,459
a big a big question mark for these

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,200
companies and it sounds like the way

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,790
that you're solving it one in an hour

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,519
and a half on Friday afternoon like

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,430
before this conference oh can you talk a

00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,500
little bit about you know building that

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,389
that that culture within the company

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,730
which it sounds like you're using SLA

00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:45,380
support for examples but then any other

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,799
tips that you have about how to really

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,930
onboard out so so I think I mean I think

00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,730
you know when you're figuring out who

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,950
you need to onboard you need to look at

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:59,610
where the difficulties have been in your

00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:02,370
infrastructure right so so when you're

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,930
figuring out like which app we are which

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,820
service to work with right who's the

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,200
problem child who needs who needs this

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,570
the most who's hitting all the issues

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,910
and deployment and we can sequester them

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,650
and make the team carry the baby I feel

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,530
like all this stuff but really you want

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,210
as an SRE I just don't want a human to

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,580
be involved I want it to automatically

00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,990
take care of it the spinnaker that helps

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,180
us go okay this one is

00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,220
disproportionately problematic let's

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,210
push that one when you say problematic

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,040
are you using metrics and hard data and

00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,730
you have a before-and-after where you

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,960
can show the success of spinnaker how is

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,760
that going to played out you know the

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,490
capital one presentation this morning

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,110
had fantastic numbers and metrics I have

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,150
not gotten we have the data

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,170
I haven't extracted out the metrics yet

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,670
but I can say very confidently that

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,640
before we implement a spinnaker most of

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,890
our issues were in that deploy can we

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,959
roll back oh no what is it you know kind

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,390
of and we had this like long time where

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,760
we have to roll back and now we just

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,239
don't look like like our postpartum surf

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,370
or other stuff yeah sure is somebody

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,350
watching this know is that feeling in

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,880
the pit of their stomach where it's it's

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,350
that feeling oh my god I don't even know

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,850
if I can roll this thing yeah yeah and I

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,549
mean I would totally encourage anyone

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,200
who whose wants more quantitative data

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,820
to go refer to the Capital One

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,400
presentation that was here this morning

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,440
at spinnaker summit because Roger had

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,200
she had fantastic numbers that

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,480
quantified slides everything that are

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,350
alive that's awesome okay so some of the

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,120
benefits that you're seeing from

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,340
Srinagar consistency and deployments

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,950
yeah the ability to roll back without

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,260
fear or basically not a problem

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,980
what what other things do you find

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,620
spinnaker is helping the organization

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,410
there so I think I mean I think it's

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,300
really helped me is you know someone who

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,490
joined the SRA team last year like I've

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,310
only been on the team a year so it's

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,890
helped me tremendously being very fast

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,140
to fix a problem so I can really look at

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,660
it I can go okay we need to scale up

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:07,310
that server group down so being able to

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,960
visualize to be able to see where the

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,210
problems are like it's become an

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,880
essential troubleshooting tool almost

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,850
instantaneously you know oh there it is

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,000
click on it oh that's great what do you

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,160
wish spinnaker could do or how do you

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,690
hope to see the project evolved as it

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:33,080
matures what are some of what's your

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:35,360
wish list do you do you does this pure

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,130
storage contribute back to the project

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,960
what's the kind of culture around the

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,700
country we've actually written some

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,370
stuff that we haven't contributed back

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,810
and I'm not sure whether we'll be able

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,330
to do that or not and there's some

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,710
discussion I do know that in a few

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,090
minutes I'm gonna be going downstairs

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,310
for the talk about contributing back

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,610
perfect and I've already figured out my

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,840
github annal and I'm going to start I'm

00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,560
really looking forward to it it'll be

00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,570
really fun

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:06,110
I've already found things that I'm like

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:08,750
oh like governance model now there's a

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,940
good good path and a good way to take it

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,590
yeah really has clarified it so I think

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,690
I think the new government's model will

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,420
help a lot with in terms of like ok how

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,530
how do I do this well thank you for

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,270
sharing your spinnaker story is there

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,590
anything else that you'd like anybody

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,390
who's on the front end of this journey

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,890
and just about to take the plunge

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,530
anything they should know things you

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,120
wish you'd known or best practices pro

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,520
tips anything at all that might help

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,960
somebody who's watching this so I

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,580
honestly think that one of the best

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,530
things about spinnaker besides all the

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,930
stuff we've covered here today is really

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:42,470
the community right is the community

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,710
being open is is this passion on the you

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,430
know on in

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:49,350
for this solution and the community is

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,669
really there to help so if you're stuck

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,740
if you have questions reach out to the

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:55,710
community we probably run into a

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,759
probably solved it ask for help yeah I

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,580
know it can be a little intimidating

00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,870
there's slack team with 5,000 people it

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,490
seems like everybody knows each other

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,870

very friendly and willing to help so

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,560
whether you are thinking about using

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,539
spinnaker and operationalizing in your

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,030
company or finding a way to give back

00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:14,250
and start to contribute we'd love to

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,759
have you involved so join the community
