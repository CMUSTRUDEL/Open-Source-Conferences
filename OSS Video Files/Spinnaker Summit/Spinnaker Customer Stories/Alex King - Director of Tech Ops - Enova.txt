it's Jody a CEO at armory and I'm here

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,900
with Alex once you go ahead and reduce

00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:14,300
yourself hi I probably the fundamentally

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,820
we started using spinnaker at the

00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,010
beginning of 2016 pretty much as it was

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,380
supposed open-sourced yeah and so it's

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,620
just I've always been here I just love

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,119
how we use it yes so I'm so curious to

00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,430
really dig into that because he were a

00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,880
very early adopter of the project that I

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,739
had a previous company right and so how

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,840
did you first learn about spinnaker what

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:37,280
was it that that interested you and what

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,210
problems were you trying to solve with

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,989
spinnaker at that time so like just

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,380
joined

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:48,110
gogo we had decided that we wanted to do

00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,020
this whole DevOps culture ship thing and

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,690
so for me having something that enabled

00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,790
developers to just write code and maybe

00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,329
had some configuration that took care of

00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:04,429
everything from CIA to CD monitoring etc

00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:07,609
Sochi was just really fundamental and my

00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:11,299
my boss was a former director of Netflix

00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:13,999
and so he said hey check out as gone so

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,950
we did and he said this is fine can you

00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:19,819
wait till spinnaker gets open so I'm

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,280
still gonna love it and we really did so

00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:22,720
you brought it in to go go

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,750
right you it sounds like you were really

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,070
looking to let the power developers to

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,840
just focus on they want to be doing

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,570
writing code creating value for the

00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,400
company in abstract we are flexing is of

00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,940
everything else proper typically has to

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,070
deal with the code into production how

00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,080
was that experience at gogo

00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,460
what was that journey like and it's

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,170
vinegar salt the poems that you're

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,360
hoping that it would solve its I think

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,210
its pinnacle works as part of the bigger

00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,060
picture right so if developers are

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,920
spending a lot more time building

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,020
infrastructure or configuring pipelines

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,000
by hand and they're not doing what they

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:03,270
should be doing which is getting paid to

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,710
write code and so having something where

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,929
we could just make it really easy for

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,160
them to adopt was was great

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:15,670
and it was kind of one of those snowball

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,950
things where you get one team seeing the

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,950
value add this gives them and how much

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,630
flexibility and freedom to go spend the

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,790
time writing code but also gain

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,900
incredibly fast feedback on how well

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,870
those changes precipitating was was just

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,680
just really really compelling for them

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:39,100
so we very quickly went from one team

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,200
using it to two teams to 14 to 18 so we

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,510
actually got to the point where other

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,850
fits of the company that were on a

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,040
completely different track writing and

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,560
creating their own Jenkins was by hand

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,320
said oh hey that's actually pretty good

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,510
maybe we can try out and and just

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,970
adoption stuff so that's that's that's

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,550
great insight because if I'm a

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,290
like a cloud architect or just

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,300
responsible for the cloud transformation

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,340
journey yet my company one of the things

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,960
that I'm sure that I'd be thinking about

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,090
as we hear this all the time how do I

00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,960
actually get these teams to adopt this

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,190
new cloud

00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,260
what if what I hear you saying is you

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,720
started with progressive innovative

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,280
teams made them successful and then use

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,050
them as an example to the rest of the

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,800
company and that really drove adoption

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,520
right

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,840
yeah they become evangelists for you

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,730
because if you're if you're just like

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,410
the core team is trying to push this

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,630
agenda you're never going to succeed

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,000
like pushing a piece of rope uphill

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,920
right yeah so what are some other best

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,450
practices or things that you've learned

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,770
that you wish that you've done when

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,170
you're on the front end of this journey

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,760
to help another person watching this be

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,590
successful we're talking a bit about

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,420
adoption here a bit about how it helps

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,280
developers be more effective and

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,280
productive what are some of the other

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,290
things leaders should be thinking about

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,590
when they're evaluating spinnaker how to

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,080
make it successful so I think spinnaker

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,780
does a great job of Sidi like a really

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,610
great job with CD there's a lot more to

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,030
it than that to be successful you can't

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,190
just create an AWS account spinning up

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,959
spinnaker and then expect everything to

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,060
be rainbows and unicorns because it's

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,370
not right you've got to think about how

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,239
you're gonna create your accounts how

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,069
you do authentication how you do naming

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:26,099
how you do account segregation how you

00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:28,289
think about egress and ingress and all

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:32,669
those things and then how you do

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:33,930
monitoring observability and so it's a

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,660
it's a really important piece of the

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,270
puzzle but it takes a little while to

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,729
figure out what all those other things

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:45,449
should be and how to make them work so

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:48,569
spinnaker is a is a integral piece of

00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:50,610
the software lifecycle aiding CD working

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,380
helps with a lot of the things we've

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,900
talked about of productivity but it's

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,909
just one piece of a larger strategy to

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,159
really be able to go from idea to

00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:02,819
feature in production efficiently and

00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:04,979
effectively it's not it's not the Silver

00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:08,099
Bullet that solves everything right yeah

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:10,500
and I think anyone that's coming to you

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,330
just that wants to do spinnaker that's

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,860
great but I think it's really important

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,259
to have people around you that can

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,449
support you and guide you for all those

00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,060
more fundamental pieces of the puzzle

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,050
first of all well if you're watching

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,520
this and thinking about bringing

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,440
spinnaker into your company there's

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,969
people like Alex in the community that

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,219
have a lot of experience that have been

00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:31,320
through not just that decision but

00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:33,840
actually scaling it out and getting it

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,759
adopted within their companies and we'd

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,440
love to have you join our community be

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,699
able to learn from people like Alex and

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,409
we're all learning from each other so

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,240
thank you for sharing your story thank

00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:44,099
you for being such an early early member

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,370
of this community it's exciting to watch

00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,370
it grow

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,450
Thanks

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,450
