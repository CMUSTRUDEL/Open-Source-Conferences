hey hey I'm Jody of the CEO of armory

00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,340
and I'm here with her with a really

00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,560
special guest this is Noah Doyle our

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,720
Investor actually our seed investor so

00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,320
Noah is a partner at javelin ventures

00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,789
and he invested in armory two years ago

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,249
back before spinnaker was really an

00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:22,159
obvious thing so I I'd love to hear what

00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:24,460
what was it about about the project that

00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:26,640
made you really excited in armory

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,540
absolutely I mean

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,930
it was really early days when we first

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:37,710
started talking about it I think it just

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,130
just been open source and I think a lot

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,550
of people were looking at like what is

00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,170
this

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,340
why would Netflix you know open source

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,710
technology platform when you know

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,710
Netflix was known for relying on public

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,900
we spent some time talking about

00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:04,949
productivity game that you got I my eyes

00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,530
is opens and I saw that opportunity to

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,050
kind of be part of a movement from an

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,560
early day early stage early days of an

00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,450
open source platform or where you want

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,550
to be from an investor's standpoint so

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,280
what is it like for you to come here to

00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,619
this conference and see see it really

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,830
starting to grow is that we're coming to

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,500
the figurehead no just amazing I think

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,509
it's it's one of those cases where you

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,540
know be careful what you wish for right

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,340
good you know momentum is starting to

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,010
kind of get beyond even what we had

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,619
imagined I think you know first that's

00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,049
hugely gratifying for armory you know

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:46,450
the early days I think it also just

00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:49,329
speaks to the potential and the

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:53,079
importance of how you know automation is

00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:57,729
taking over the software development

00:01:53,079 --> 00:02:00,549
life cycle SDLC so while we have you if

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:02,560
there are any engineers or other

00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,240
candidates that see this that are

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,850
thinking about joining our marina

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,950
what what would you say to them why join

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,660
a series a funded startup instead of

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:15,579
going to what we affectionately call the

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:18,489
retirement home of a large tech yeah

00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:20,440
well I think not everyone's ready ready

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,260
for retirement right so that's number

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,540
one but I think part of it is the

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,640
mission you know our Murray's goal is

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,849
really to transform how software is

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,310
built and published and that goal you

00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:35,470
know it's a big enough mission it'll

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,959
never be truly complete but there's an

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,090
enormous amount of work to do and the

00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,640
company is really on the cusp of quite a

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,900
few breakthroughs where we've seen

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,840
developer productivity transform and

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,489
just developer happiness explode at our

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,560
Murray customers and that's an amazing

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,930
thing to be a part of I think that's

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,220
that's the number one thing you know

00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,380
when I think about early in my career

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,380
what were the things that got me most

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,080
excited it was solving huge problems and

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,000
that's what armories

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,950
thank you for the support really

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,840
appreciate you having believed in us

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,840

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,699
