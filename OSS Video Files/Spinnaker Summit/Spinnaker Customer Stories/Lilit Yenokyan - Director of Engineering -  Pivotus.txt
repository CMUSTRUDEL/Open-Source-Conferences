okay hey I'm Jodi at the city of armory

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,410
and I'm here with a very special guest a

00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,610
new user in the spinnaker community so

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,610
I'm gonna let you introduce yourself

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,510
so you you recently brought spinnaker

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,880
into pivot it would be great to hear

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,010
about what what was the problem that you

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,079
were looking to solve why spinnaker

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,700
especially for anybody watching this who

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,890
doesn't know spinnaker that well sure so

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,170
one of our pain points that mr. Neff was

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,090
actually continuous deployment or the

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,930
lack of it the process manually setting

00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:01,140
up a new environment in deployments

00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:04,760
hours so spinnaker was something that we

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,090
could have used to get to zero down

00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,970
be able to do as many of those days we

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:15,920
did without really having asking our

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:17,360
customers so was it about safety and

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,540
being able to deploy without the

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,580
downtime or was it about speed and

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,860
having a more efficient process fewer

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,470
steps or was it a combination of both

00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,660
how did you kind of think about the

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:44,700
justification internally

00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:48,300
ROI to reduce the need to depend on

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,760
manual work so instead of helping ops

00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:56,730
engineers to the manual step by step

00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:59,160
process well so happy to have pivot us

00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,870
in the community if you're watching this

00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,200
and you want to learn more about how

00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:08,220
pivot us is using spinnaker can they

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,260
reach out to you okay so you can find

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,570
her in slack the spinnaker slack team

00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,120
has about 5,000 people in it as of today

00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:19,850
it's probably gonna be growing quickly

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,850
as it has been so in each out

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,759
