00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,759
very storied past with spinnaker yeah

00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,259
I'd love to

00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:21,739
just have you take us on that journey

00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:23,810
yeah we've been using spinnaker in this

00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:25,189
form of as guarded with from Netflix and

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,980
then it kind of became open source in

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:30,319
2015 I started working at a company

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,149
called gogo and we implemented spinnaker

00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:36,469
pretty much from the adoption of that

00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:38,359
article and yeah this has been a trip

00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,010
it's been a great product to follow see

00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,539
get better and ultimately now we're at a

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,859
conference so I never thought in a

00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,750
million years what happened it's pretty

00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:49,429
amazing yeah it's pretty crazy so legit

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:51,920
legit conference now yeah Jake

00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:53,390
conference yeah ok so what is what is it

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,199
about spinnaker that you're passionate

00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:00,050
about yeah one obviously the community

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,030
as Pete was talking I'm a community

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,430
builder in Chicago I love building

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,260
communities and just seeing this awesome

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,060
community get together let's talk about

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,460
how we can improve the project have a

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,720
common goal it's awesome and the best

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,250
part is all the new people coming along

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,010
trying to find out how to get started

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,360
it's pretty cool yeah yeah if somebody's

00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,830
interested in learning more about

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,260
spinnaker maybe they're watching this

00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,630
and they're

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,250
curious what would you recommend cuz it

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,710
could be a pretty daunting thing join

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,210
the slack team 5,000 people in there

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,160
they seem to all know each other

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,680
how does someone really get involved

00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,560
yeah that's that's a good question

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,030
I've kind of found that the slack

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,020
Channel is kind of daunting there's so

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,360
much muscle just kind of going through

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,480
there but if you can find a common theme

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,150
the disk or the the channel we that we

00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,040
have it's awesome and also the the

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,020
community forums that were announced

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,520
last year is a great way because a lot

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,110
of the issues that you finally ran into

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,790
or are running into have been answered

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,930
on that forum and from there if you kind

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,490
of build a network and you say hey how

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,570
did you solve this or maybe someone

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,030
responded there I think that's a great

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,640
way to get started events like this

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,650
meetups as another way if your city has

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,150
a fortunate enough to have a meet-up go

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,830
to it if you are in the community

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,360
consider giving the talk so you can

00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,250
build a community where you're at yeah

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,470
that's great yeah what are some of your

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,760
hopes for the project as it evolved but

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,520
well we how would you like to see

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,110
spinnaker mature but what what problems

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,400
do you wish it's all but it's not great

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,840
at solving today yeah I mean it's good

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,209
to see you the kubernetes support kind

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,920
of becoming more evolved because I think

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,540
that's as everyone's kind of hinting is

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,570
where infrastructure is kind of going

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,239
right seeing that involving from Google

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,830
and for folks and Netflix is big I'm

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,540
looking forward to seeing how the b2

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,400
provider kind of progresses along from

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,610
the b1 so explain the BT provided to

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,300
anybody who doesn't

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,130
be one versus me - why do I keep hearing

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,170
about that yeah be one provider was a

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,550
little bit more opinionated style of

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,340
committees deployment from the Netflix

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,860
v2 kind of takes a step back if you will

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,530
and does more of a loosely based

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,030
manifest style deployment which is great

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,470
because it gives companies flexibility

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,930
not everyone can transform their

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,430
infrastructure very Netflix like style

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,920
feet soon kind of gives you that

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,870
flexibility so it's going to it's a year

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,000
you're pretty new to red box games like

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,230
red box has hired a few people to really

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,270
build out this infrastructure function

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,160
what I don't know how much you can talk

00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,680
about what the initiatives are or yeah

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,810
great to learn about that no I mean at

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,450
red box we're this company right now

00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,010
we're starting our in the past year we

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,739
announced our streaming services and

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,270
we're building that platform up with

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,250
them we're running into some scaling

00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,900
things and we're scaling issues and

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,760
we're trying to see how we can we

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,410
leverage the cloud to deliver on the

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,600
scaling and ultimately see if we can

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,100
help drive our distances as well there's

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,470
a lot of great company that solves a lot

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,480
of challenges like target never well

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,680
obviously Netflix and a lot of great

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,420
other companies here that talked about

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,299
how you can spinnaker even for hardware

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,500
delivery I'm really excited to see the

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,360
OCA talk from the open connect team

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,010
tomorrow that's really interesting

00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,630
tonight you took a software tool to go

00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,760
drive a hardware solution have yeah

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,410
which is awesome I think it's it's it's

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,040
that this is the special and really

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,560
amazing

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,079
about open source that Netflix creates a

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640
platform open source is it that a

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,469
company like Red Box can leverage this

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,060
open source project to build out a

00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:19,060
streaming business I mean that is like

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,620
it's a full circle type thing and now

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,660
you have everyone kind of contributing

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,100
back it's no longer I don't see it as a

00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,110
Netflix project but I'm sort of see it

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,030
as like a spinnaker community project

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,229
it's awesome to see it though it is yeah

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,960
so if you're interested in getting

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:34,000
involved in the community we'd love to

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,650
have you I promise it's welcoming it's

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
open it might feel a little bit

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,550
intimidating at the beginning but people

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,270
like Joel are in there and happy to help

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:49,550
