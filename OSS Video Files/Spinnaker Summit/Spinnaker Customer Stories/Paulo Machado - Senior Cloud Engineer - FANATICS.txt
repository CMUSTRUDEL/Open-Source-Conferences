hey it's Jerry OC of armory I'm here

00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,839
with Paulo I'll let you introduce

00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,290
yourself that's so my name is Paulo I

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,440
work for phonetics I'm pretty much one

00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,830
of the first called engineers in the new

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:23,250
platform that dynamics is doing so we

00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:28,180
would have been doing a lot of chance to

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,610
get the Purdue tivity for years so make

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,580
sure that they are focused on delivering

00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,740
features and not too focused on how they

00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,370
will do yeah yeah I let them do it they

00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,910
do best

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,010
ship ship ship ok cool and so we're at a

00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,930
meet-up right now talking about

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,910
spinnaker you're on the front end of

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,650
your spinnaker journey so maybe you can

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,300
talk a bit about what it is about

00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,480
spinnaker that's interesting the way

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,860
you're thinking about it whether or not

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,420
you think you'll do something just you

00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,579
know somebody who's watching this might

00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,380
be just now hearing about vinegar for

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:03,059
the first time so how would you describe

00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:07,800
your thought process around it so for me

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,960
spinnaker is a way to level up

00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:15,130
traditional thinking about the moments

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,950
where you don't you don't think about

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,040
only a little bit employment even or you

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,740
actually through components like Fanta

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,310
you add some sort of a smart layer and

00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,130
at the moments where you have insights

00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:33,119
what is going on injured

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,200
and that's the for me is one of the key

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,350
things that I'm we are looking at using

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,960
the automated canary piece yep so

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,990
anybody that doesn't know Kayenta that's

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,070
the judge there was open sourced

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,840
recently I don't know if you want to

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,280
talk in a bit more detail about what it

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,649
is about kinda that you think is

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,569
interesting yeah so for me like all the

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,750
demos that I see we are not using

00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:03,330
spinnaker yet but other names that are

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,110
see through a baseline you can compare

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:12,870
if your change is impacting some key

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:15,989
metrics of your system and that as in I

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,959
heard a lot of use cases and I see in

00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,780
all my past experience problems between

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,190
oh it's okay your code is actually

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:30,120
working but you are affecting some

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:32,940
hidden metric hidden CP utilization or

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,230
key performance metric that you if you

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,079
don't have this insight you actually be

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,739
able to tell if your changes actually

00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:46,530
good or not yeah so it'll be it'll be

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,030
great to hear from you in another six

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,950
months or next time we get to sit down

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,410
would love to get an update to hear

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,389
about it and if if you are thinking

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,950
about getting involved in spinnaker

00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,440
there is a very vibrant community

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,389
there's a spinnaker slack team with over

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,829
5,000 people in it and there's a lot of

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,079
people that are in the same shoes that

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:05,700
you might be in follows an example just

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,680
on the front end of the journey and

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,660
interested in some of the best practices

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,220
at spinnaker enables and when I heard

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,470
you say I'll just repeat it back to you

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,060
you are looking to enable developers to

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,980
be productive without them having to

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,900
think so much about the whole deployment

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,970
process and you see spinnaker as a way

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,130
to enable them to move faster with

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,060
safety and you like a lot of the

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,879
features that you get out-of-the-box

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,269
like automated

00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:31,790
Canaries for example that that enable

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,439
that to happen yeah okay all right good

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,299
well thank you for taking the time you

00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,060
can't wait to get an update in a few

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:40,269
months awesome I'll be back yeah I'm

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,269

00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,699
