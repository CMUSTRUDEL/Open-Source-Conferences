hey this is Judy as a CEO of armory I'm

00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,670
here with Lars going to introduce

00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,470
yourself hi I'm Lars I work on the

00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,780
Google spinnaker team I leave the

00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,950
open-source effort there and I've been

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,680
involved with the project for about

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,210
three years now so let's just start with

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,669
a little bit of your history how did you

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,839
get involved in the project and and what

00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:23,529
what kind of drew you to it

00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:26,419
originally right so I joined Google

00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:27,800
right out of school and was working on a

00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:29,630
team that did a lot of open-source

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,310
integration the standard that was

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,609
something I found very interesting but

00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,469
it was also in some ways very menial at

00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:38,390
the time the same team was working on an

00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,640
open-source vinegar I got involved

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,829
helping write some integration test work

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,629
on some of the infrastructure there and

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,489
happened with it ever since just drew

00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:49,190
you in yeah it's a really good group of

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,780
people and they're really really tight

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,359
collaboration between Netflix and Google

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,550
was a lot of fun because one Netflix is

00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,969
a very stellar high level high

00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,890
performing engineering team and having

00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:03,070
that same quality of talent that Google

00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,390
worked together even though it's across

00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,270
organizational or company lines is very

00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,340
interesting so when I hear people talk

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,330
about spinnaker that that knew it a

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,770
couple of years ago when I was just

00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,760
getting open source they describe

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,640
spinnaker it's just being free

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,750
and have built built for for Netflix who

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,190
was involved it seems that really

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,610
modernized it you know especially the

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:25,370
whole moon Eddie's movie min what what

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,510
what would you say is Google's main

00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,820
motivation for getting involved in this

00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,140
project what what's the strategy

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,120
I think the involvement is pretty clear

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,620
it's the better our cooling is for the

00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,930
con flat form the more people can use

00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,520
the platform so if we make the tooling

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,160
great for kubernetes in App Engine and

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,200
GCE that's better for all our customers

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,700
because holistically there's not always

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,710
a great story for DevOps some of these

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,300
kinds of platforms and having pooling

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,330
that not only makes it easy but the most

00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,820
best practice really helps accelerate

00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,810
our customers velocity and improves

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,520
their experience deploying core

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,380
platforms that's awesome and you've been

00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,820
very involved in the committee's journey

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,370
for spinnaker so maybe we can talk a

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,750
little bit about the v1 provider v2 what

00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,940
does that even mean someone who's

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,640
hearing v1 v2 everywhere yeah yeah how

00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,030
they're different and that's a wall yeah

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,160
great question so

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,660
when I enjoined the team after we open

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,790
source spinnaker we immediately started

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,030
working on human any support because

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,410
that was like the the natural

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,930
alternative to BM deployments was

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,910
kubernetes which was in version one two

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,980
one three at the time so very new it was

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,630
a very exciting hot platform but again

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,850
no great developer tooling for deploying

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,120
to it so we took the existing paradigms

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,220
that spinnaker had set for GCE AWS and

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,040
Azure and adopted those for kubernetes

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,360
which in some sense may be the

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,470
abstraction wasn't perfect and it

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,989
created some friction and some rough

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,580
edges around how people expect to manage

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,860
the crew Benes kubernetes resources

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,250
versus how they expect to manage the GCE

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,320
resources what we saw it was people that

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,360
liked that degree of abstraction

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,680
removing them from kubernetes really

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,090
like to be one provider but the people

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,090
who wanted to be in control and have

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,560
very direct access to the manifest to

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,030
the Sierra needs that kubernetes exposes

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,310
and all the things that kubernetes has

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,870
added over the past couple releases it

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,450
wasn't really working for them so we

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,520
went back to the drawing board revisited

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,519
all the primitives and built a sort of

00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,260
marrying of the imperative approaching

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,880
spinnaker with a declarative approach of

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,880
Coober 90s to the best we could

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,580
so let's talk a little about that that

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,709
that provider that evolution what we're

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,380
doing to see that going and also if I am

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,470
you I am I'm not talking about

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,910
communities but I'm new to spinnaker but

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,410
what I'm hearing you say is the VG

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,810
providers should be much more what I

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,670
would expect to see versus the v1

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,530
provider which maybe if I knew spinnaker

00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,540
gave me access to communities but

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,400
was didn't give me enough control that's

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,740
a great point so if you're coming in as

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,230
a very kubernetes knowledgeable guy and

00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,270
you know what you want to have to point

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,800
there you'll find that spinnaker makes

00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,510
it much easier for you to express what

00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,950
you want to do with kubernetes of course

00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,660
at the same time what you're expressing

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,670
shouldn't be what your application

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,100
developers see the rock communities

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,069
mammal the manifest camel is maybe to

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,390
low level or to down to the details for

00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,250
the average application development team

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,140
so it also gives you the power through

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,970
templating stages and they're

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,989
abstracting things into artifacts and

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,910
extracting things with pipeline

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,440
templates to hide those details from

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,609
your application developers where needed

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,560
so we're trying to really strike that

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,060
balance between you have all the control

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,460
you need but you can also build on top

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,050
of it the abstractions to hide the messy

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,419
details from your developers so let's

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,419
say that I'm a cloud architect at a

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:35,540
global 2000 company it's a you know my

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,669
responsibility is to help companies you

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,870
know move into the clouds big models and

00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:41,540
micro services to containerized

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,910
workloads when when is the right time to

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,620
start looking at using spinnaker maybe

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,050
I've got some teams are using kubernetes

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,630
without spinnaker what what are the

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,520
signals that I should look for within my

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,440
organization to say okay maybe it's time

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,970
to bring this platform in that's a great

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,530
question I think it varies for every

00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,360
organization but a couple things that we

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,590
noticed that people start to feel his

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,200
pain points when they look for a thing

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,140
like spinnaker is first they're trying

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,880
to rewrite their application delivery

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,590
stack and they're looking for a new tool

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,120
that'll help them do it correctly

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,169
of course that's on everyone and on

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,570
everyone's trying to rewrite everything

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,310
at the all the time but once people

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,990
started to realize that maybe there's

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,000
too much duplication of effort across a

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,620
wide range of teams or there's too much

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,780
messy shell scripting that keeps

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,120
breaking at is undable or maintainable

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,890
for an Operations team is a good time to

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,260
start thinking about well maybe we want

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,390
to centralize this maybe we want

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,680
some of the best practices we've learned

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,110
from the various teams doing this

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,820
themselves and trying to bring it all

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,530
into one tool that make this easier yeah

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,320
I mean we see a lot of companies that

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:44,350
are you know just just starting to get

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,820
serious about containerization and you

00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,650
know a lot of people come to us and say

00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,660
okay we have these forward-thinking

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,330
application teams that are coming to us

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,400
you know as the VPNs and saying I you

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,860
know I want to be using the kubernetes I

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,240
I don't want to have happen again what

00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,890
happened five years ago when they set up

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
now we have to be in the cloud and I

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,550
have to rewrite all this all over again

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,950
I'm looking for some kind of a platform

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,270
that I can leverage that will be future

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,040
proofed a little bit so that whenever

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,830
whatever comes next whether it's cloud

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,850
functions or land or you know I'm ready

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,850
for that as well and it seems like

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:18,010
spinnaker helps helps solve that I can

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,660
leverage communities at scale today I'm

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,190
also able to leverage local targets and

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,900
future tech technology to more

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,669
effectively

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,900
I think there's a general reluctance of

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,759
the industry to build everything over

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,259
and over again and with the momentum you

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,669
see behind containers right now as a

00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,620
success then big companies have seen

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,780
like Google running containers on Borg

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,270
internal e means that I do think it's

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,639
here to stay for a certain a certain way

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,780
that a certain it's not it doesn't have

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,639
a fungibility that people are afraid of

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,100
people are aware that creating a new

00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,780
thing every 10 years isn't sustainable

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,310
and putting a lot of effort engineering

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,020
behind it makes sense so what are you

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,460
working on now what are some of the the

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,530
specific priorities that you have

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,570
whether it's around the v2 provider how

00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,979
it evolves or anything else and regards

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,139
to the project so the big thing we're

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,940
working on right now is better traffic

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,760
management for the v2 provider what that

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,650
means is you deploy something and maybe

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,050
the kubernetes deployment object isn't

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,820
enough for you because you want to do a

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,039
staged rollout you want to roll out 10%

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,639
and 20% maybe you want to do a canary

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,289
with less traffic for more pods so what

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,060
that means is we want to have a tighter

00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:23,770
integration with this do in the sense

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,900
that you don't have to write this to

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,340
manifest yourself to use it you can rely

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,050
on Spinnaker's abstractions where

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,570
necessary to make it easier to define

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,699
repeatable rollout pipelines on a set of

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,860
manifest v2 player and some third-party

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:37,419
or external git repo and have that as

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,330
defined your delivery pipeline so that's

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,099
cool so on the flip side you've got the

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,570
cloud architect over here if I am

00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:45,820
interested in contributing to this

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,590
project what do you recommend yeah

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,970
there's there's 5,000 people in the

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,860
slack team everyone seems to know each

00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,849
other it's a little intimidating what's

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,699
the best way to actually get involved

00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:56,830
that's great so we have a label on

00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,479
github which is beginner-friendly if

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,129
someone added that label it means

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,899
they'll be able to coach you through

00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,639
a certain creature so if you go into

00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,619
github and click on labels click on

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,830
beginner-friendly there's probably 20 30

00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:09,639
issues which are very approachable and

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,139
represent significant chunks of work

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,069
that we think that someone can take on

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:16,449
as a first project we finally published

00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:17,709
some governance guidelines and how to

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:19,330
become a committee yourself so if you

00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:21,459
want to contribute but not only

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,050
contribute really get involved there are

00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,330
clear steps you can take to get you a

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,179
commitment rights into the medical repos

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,939
it's awesome and you also recently did a

00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:34,569
technical webinar about the v2 provider

00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:36,459
ID so yeah if if you're interested in

00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:38,860
