hey it's rodeo CEO diary I'm here with

00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,910
Bernard we'll let you introduce yourself

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,890
hi I'm Bernard golden vice-president

00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,620
cloud stretch for Capital One

00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,870
so Capital One has been a very very

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,570
early adopter of spinnaker and just a

00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,489
driving a driving force in this project

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,710
you joined Capital One I'm guessing it

00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,489
was about a year ago is that nine months

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,140
of nine months ago

00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:26,539
okay so would love to hear a little bit

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,999
about about your journey into Capital

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,149
One and and you're involved in now with

00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:35,180
spinnaker or just cloud shore

00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:36,710
transformation generally well I have had

00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,629
the opportunity to work with Capital One

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,269
when I was at a small software company

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:43,250
kapalua customer so I was aware of it

00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:45,530
being I'm just kind of very all in cloud

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,809
journey and so when I first started

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,719
talking to myself in my view that's

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,239
where all comes you have to go they're

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,519
going to have to use cloud as their

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,649
fundamentals computing substrate so I

00:00:55,519 --> 00:01:00,120
joined Capital One when I joined it I

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:01,830
knew something about it but I

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,019
know everything about it obviously you

00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,160
never do yeah and when I came in and one

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,650
of these I want to do was sort of

00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,020
calibrate this capital one city in terms

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,450
of its cloud journey is called adoption

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,060
its techniques its practices

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,600
and my conclusion after a fair amount of

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,540
research was that really they're the

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,550
peers for Capital One are kind of the

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,260
cloud native companies and it really

00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,460
looks like a cloud mater company it's

00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,760
got the same types of practices

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,410
processes tooling and spin the first

00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,080
part of that it's been working with

00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,509
spinnaker for over two years and it's a

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,200
pretty core part of a significant part

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,180
of our infrastructure praxis not

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,850
Universal at this point I definitely

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,649
used so I've got a bunch of questions to

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,940
you about spinnaker but before we

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,700
talking about spinnaker I'd love to talk

00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,649
a little bit about just the the cultural

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,970
shift if I'm a cloud architect watching

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,710
this and we see this all the time

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,810
there's these leaders that are tasked

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,840
with bringing in is moving to the cloud

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,630
and an organization that is just not

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,539
ready to make that shift and having one

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,959
is done as incredibly well so what are

00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:12,420
some of your Pro tips best practices

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,370
weight ways for a cloud transformation

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,810
leader to actually be successful in

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,700
leading a company on the journey of the

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,490
capital

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,410
or probably the better part of a decade

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,760
yeah well kind of the background this is

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,750
what I've heard I've only been there

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,690
nine months love isn't that you know it

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,970
had done a kind of traditional organ

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,090
outsource IT to cost center let's find a

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,489
low-cost offshore place and then about

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,350
maybe six years ago it said you know the

00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,450
future financial services we need to be

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,850
a tech company it unwound all that

00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,849
outsourcing started to build you know

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,830
sort of really higher in talent they

00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,810
built up a San Francisco president some

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,510
Bay Area quest to get access that kind

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,660
of talent I start permeating out made

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,690
the cloud decision you know I think that

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,230
this kind of transformations can't

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,230
happen without

00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:09,550
and I don't mean just top commitment

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,290
from the Purser's head of IT because it

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,239
does to me it doesn't matter if the

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,030
person's head of IT says you know we

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,650
should go do this thing if that

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,959
organization is still viewed as well

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,849
that's kind of a cost center something

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:26,380
to be managed it has to be something

00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:30,370
that the entire company grafts grasses

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,739
because they feel it's part of the core

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,840
strategy of the company so Capital One

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,430
was largely in Denison it has largely

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,049
moved out of data centers I believe at

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,480
this point minimizing that footprint

00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:45,250
yeah I believe there was an initiative

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,319
by around now 2018-2019 to really cut

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:52,239
that down but not entirely I don't

00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:56,410
believe is that well no the the move

00:03:52,239 --> 00:04:00,549
toward public cloud started 2014-2015

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:02,590
the CIO of Capital One got up and

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,950
reinvent said we're going really

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,959
strongly with AWS so it's been a journey

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,670
I can't say too much about exactly where

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,590
we are in terms of having left data

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:15,120
centers or whatever our announced

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,680
intentions to me out as soon as possible

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,169
and we're moving very strongly and

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,880
working very diligently toward that so I

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,160
think if I'm an executive just looking

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,470
at the math public cloud can look

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,570
expensive there's an there's an

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,210
innovation potion here that gets

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,690
unlocked by enabling to move into the

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,990
cloud

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:36,300
how did Capital One justify or just even

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,880
decide to make that shift what were some

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,919
of the big drivers of that strategy you

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,150
know I'm gonna say I'm gonna have to

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,190
take a bit of a pass on that because I

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:48,870
was not at the company but this I

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,310
believe this is a company that's not

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:55,919
afraid to say this is the right thing to

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:58,800
do let's go do it and we'll and so you

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,380
know I mean the company is still run by

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,590
its founding one of its founders tell me

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,330
about 25 years old and it's very much

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,639
always been a strategy like company I

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,740
think and so they said we have to be a

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,419
tech company the right way to do tech

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,669
going forward it was not the operator on

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,500
bases let's figure out how to go do that

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,060
all right so let's fast-forward to today

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,460
and let's talk a little bit about

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,110
spinnaker so how would you describe the

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,030
adoption of spinnaker within Capital One

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,090
and and just kind of cloud strategy

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,560
generally yeah well the cloud strategy

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,430
is very clear we're on and on public

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,530
cloud all in AWS well AWS is our

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,050
preferred cloud provider when I would

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,909
say that we probably like anyone would

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,569
say you know we have to understand

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,370
alternatives

00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:46,000
all right so multi cloud as the strategy

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,919
is a priority well I think it's fair to

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,189
say that we're examining you know we

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:55,389
keep an eye on what's going on in terms

00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:57,430
of spinnaker it's pretty widely used as

00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:00,009
I said we've been using for a couple of

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,620
years one of my colleagues spoke at last

00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,629
year's spinnaker summit one of my other

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,870
colleagues is going to be keynoting

00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:10,180
tomorrow morning so you know clearly we

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,759
have pretty strong commitment to a

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,599
pretty strong use with a great team that

00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,729
really focuses on using I should say

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,979
enabling spinnaker and then we have

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,840
teams that are using it within their own

00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:24,130
application pipelines

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,139
yeah one of the interesting things that

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,470
I remember from last year's talk is that

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,510
Capital One's put a different front end

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,860
on spinnaker so it seems like the actual

00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,639
user experience for application

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,320
engineers Capital One is is custom based

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,600
on I guess whatever they're used to I'm

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,160
assuming but then under the hood that's

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,010
being powered by spinnaker is is that is

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,810
that an accurate representation or would

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,200
you describe I guess what I'd say is

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,750
it's more like it's spinnaker plus some

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,040
stuff again that as Capital One the kind

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,560
of organization we are the kind of

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,840
company the kinds of things we have to

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,210
keep track of are added to that so it's

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,800
not so much you know we got rid of stuff

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,350
it's just that we needed other things

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,180
we'd be attract during a deployment so

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,380
this was also before your time so I

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,610
don't know if you'd know the answer but

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,460
I'd be curious to know what it was about

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,680
spinnaker that made Capital One such an

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:21,630
early adopter well I'm just going to

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,010
infer that we felt like we needed a

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,540
something to do confuse deployment

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,930
around we have a pretty strong

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,610
preference toward using open source you

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,000
know I think we probably did a

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,120
evaluation and kinda concluded this was

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,140
a

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,950
pretty strong candidate for us to look

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,570
at so what is your priority here at the

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,930
summit what are some of the things that

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,220
you hope spinnaker evolves into or some

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,960
of the problems that you're wrestling

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,000
with and you'd like to see spinnaker

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,280
solving or what are kind of some of your

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,830
hopes for the project well I don't know

00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,070
that I'm here so much to sort of say you

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,430
know it ought to do it does ABC you know

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,810
I'm really concerned about de I

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,880
personally came here more as I said

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,940
really I think cloud native companies

00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,650
are technical peers and I want to see

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,210
how they're using spinners what kinds of

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,670
issues they're running into where

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,350
they're pushing it what they're asking

00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,790
because that's where we're likely to be

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,510
going yeah so I really want to

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:24,400
understand so you're looking at these

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,620
other cloud native companies the other

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,770
early adopters and you're looking to see

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,200
what that roadmap looks like and you're

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,300
basically going to be able to be a fast

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,310
follower there and you're likely your

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,200
years ahead of other financial

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,390
institutions that are not thinking

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,780
themselves as technology companies with

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,669
that

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,190
well accurate you could say that I

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,760
couldn't boss that comment but what I

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,740
will say yes we you know are are

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,670
technical we think of ourselves as a

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,470
technology company

00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,760
our technical peers I think are

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,490
following practices that we're going

00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,710
after

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,110
and we really want to make sure we get

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:03,470
running and that's part of my role is to

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,570
make is to really track industry to have

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,490
it be a feed into our strategy and if

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,330
I'm a cloud architect watching this do

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,640
you have any any best practices Pro tips

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,110
as I'm starting to lead my company on

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,960
this journey that Capital One is well

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,090
into things that that you wish that you

00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,860
had thought about or known nine months

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,520
ago or previously in your career that

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,470
somebody like that should be thinking

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,440
about well I sound like a broken record

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,300
but you have to have sponsorship from

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,640
above I think the kind of we're gonna do

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,720
a skunkworks kind of model doesn't

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,970
really work in something that's

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,060
transformational yeah so I think that's

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,590
that's really critical I mean assuming

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,990
you get that obviously you're gonna

00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:48,230
start with some initial proof of

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,550
concepts really build those out and most

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,530
of the companies that I've seen these

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,900
success with that then built a center of

00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,510
excellence to really you know sort of

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,610
have a core place where new groups that

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,260
are interested in adopting this stuff

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,320
have some place they can go to to learn

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:06,170
from and then do a lot of evangelism

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,330
eternal go out and bang the drum a lot I

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,540
