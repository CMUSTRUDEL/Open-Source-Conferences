	00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,400
hey it's rodeo see you at armory I'm

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,120
here with Brian let you introduce

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,910
yourself

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,709
Brian Behnke from the Cisco team all

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,900
right so you have been involved in

00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:15,209
spinnaker for a while now yeah over a

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,770
year okay pretty excited love to hear

00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:19,290
you tell your story a little bit maybe

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,380
the origin story about how you first

00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,110
learned about spinnaker yeah we on the

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,390
product side we have a we're making our

00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,600
products from being on trim hardware

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,660
base to cloud native software and to do

00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,460
that then you need to do the DevOps on

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,120
the customer premises and so we looked

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,859
at toiling and spinnaker was the clear

00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,710
choice for us and so we went down the

00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,359
path and and we didn't want to just make

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,339
it like another that we're just a user

00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,499
of the tool so we actually you know

00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,780
dedicated some resources to help get the

00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:53,729
kubernetes driver first up and all and

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,550
it was it was a great experience and you

00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:58,879
can't find a better open-source project

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,199
to work on with the people are so nice

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:07,590
from all the different groups including

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:10,200
including our and but then we started an

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,420
internal spinnaker interest kind of the

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,460
equivalent of a flat channel for that

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,500
and our IT department and also picked up

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,439
the I'm on more on the product side but

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,270
the IT department picked it up and as

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,610
referenced by we have eight people here

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,770
this week you know there's a lot there's

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,170
a lot of interest on our IT side for it

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,670
and I believe they said yesterday

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:38,369
they're converting 1200 applications to

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:41,399
two cloud native and so they're they're

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,009
just going to GA out their first CI CD

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,869
basic tooling pipeline for a self-serve

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,810
models

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:52,070
begin to transition as they transition

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:54,439
their applications they'll be running so

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,909
we're doing it kind of we're not trying

00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,009
to rush it we're trying to make sure

00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,990
that these first ones come out good so

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:03,079
that we get you know I know in some of

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:05,530
the literature you guys start small get

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,850
a good foundation and so it's been a

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,769
great product

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:14,750
we've also began to move our we use it

00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:17,810
with it's such a great demonstration

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,060
tool for customers also to show them the

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,099
the DevOps how you can do canary

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,370
deployments and canary deployments is

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:28,790
the key driver for us when we go out to

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,440
our big customers give them our software

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,629
they want to put it in stage obviously

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,370
but then they also want to hook real

00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,410
subscribers up to it and begin to get

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:41,390
traffic through the software and canary

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:44,060
is just such an interesting use case

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,640
I've got a lot of questions for you so

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,560
many places that I'd love to dig in so

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,930
if I'm a cloud architect and I am

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,120
responsible for leading my company's

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,700
cloud transformation journey I'm sure

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,109
that I would really want to understand a

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,390
lot more about it

00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:03,120
what other turnings you evaluated

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,850
and in why you fix vinegar and then as

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,790
cisco is going on its own journey into

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,580
the cloud basically learn more about

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,470
what what that with that process of to

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,880
be successful onboarding application so

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,950
you talked about starting small and

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,590
showing success but could you maybe just

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,600
get a bit more tackle on what some of

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,590
those actual decision points were yeah

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,450
the the big one for us was what you have

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,270
two environments right you have your

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,890
development tool chain where you're

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,900
doing jenkins builds and they're

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,230
creating environments and deploying and

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,390
then you also have then when you're now

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,489
pushing that up into the cloud type

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,500
things but then we have other teams that

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,489
don't go to the cloud they go out to the

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,070
on-prem to the customer right and so

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,810
spinnaker you know you know for some of

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,880
the internal stuff we've looked at

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,640
spinnaker and for the external stuff

00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,959
also and it fits both use cases but it

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,660
really fits for us the one where you're

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:09,299
deploying to a cloud you know type of a

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:12,120
data center the best we most of the

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:16,350
competition that was all homegrown you

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,290
know tolling it's really just and so

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,820
there's a I appreciate all the blogs and

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,190
all the literature you guys send out

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,919
because it helps to convince people that

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,900
it's of why you want to do this because

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,169
people get very short-sighted and narrow

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:36,150
as to as to why they're gonna you know

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:38,729
take a certain approach and so we we at

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,289
Cisco formed a community a cloud Native

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,879
community

00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:45,889
and we we give people tooling for them

00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,199
to use spinnaker stair we've taken

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,949
Kayenta made it in the helm charts and

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:55,580
people are using it effectively for for

00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:58,309
canary based deployments and we didn't

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,689
do like we don't force people to go a

00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:03,020
certain route you know we're telling

00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:04,279
people hey and so we let products live

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,289
on their own marriage and that's why

00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,539
spinnaker I think has done so so well

00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,999
because it's a good prob like it's easy

00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:12,800
to get everybody gets it in five minutes

00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:18,169
you know you give a quick demo you get

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,419
it but it's a it's a big journey so so

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,860
let's take into two to two pieces here

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,529
it sounds like the first part is really

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,990
a a cultural transformation right and

00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:29,599
getting executives I don't know if this

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,709
is in engineering leadership or kind of

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:35,990
how how bars or because we're a little

00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:39,139
bit more engineering focus the groups

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,029
that I'm working on it's well from the

00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,770
from the product side it's more

00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,990
engineering focused and it's just

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,289
developer to developer and then that

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,089
kind of gets shown to product managers

00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:53,240
and they love it then blah blah blah but

00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:56,449
for IT it's more of a process than IT

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,809
has when you have you know hundreds of

00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:02,180
development teams doing applications you

00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:04,009
know you can't be like let everybody do

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,339
their own CSCS so they're they're more

00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:09,019
prescriptive but again they have to

00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,069
they've got doubters out there so

00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:12,889
they're they're going through the

00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:17,300
process of convincing everyone so I

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:19,759
think just having a good solid

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,909
foundation of understanding I thought

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,240
the MER antis guys presentation was very

00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:28,369
good he explained the different you know

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,009
parts of the process and where spinnaker

00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:32,240
plays its role and it really helps to be

00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,330
able to explain

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,590
so you you've got this this cultural

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,620
journey that you've been taking the

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,660
karate on to really really adopt and our

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,410
customers and the customers are casting

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,080
yeah because the customers are also you

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,639
know traditional at least area I mean

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,169
they're traditional big service

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,419
providers and they're not used to doing

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:57,319
devops either and so they all want to

00:06:53,419 --> 00:07:02,539
learn so a lot of its training to do it

00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:04,759
a lot of it is security around the

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:07,160
pipelines and you know not just

00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,169
compliance but just that security and

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,030
the software in general you know from

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:14,180
vulnerabilities getting all that types

00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:17,360
of things verifying that your your

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,770
religious are you know came from a

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,900
trusted source so I think security will

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:29,960
be more and more important to spinnaker

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:31,430
over okay and and so once you have

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,560
everybody bought in on the high level

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,229
concepts including customers are just

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,300
really interesting then you're you're

00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,580
bringing this platform in and you're

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,289
showing small amounts of success and

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,970
building on that are there specific

00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:49,940
metrics that you've used with born after

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:52,310
case studies or what what what were the

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:59,719
the things that made everybody agree

00:07:52,310 --> 00:08:02,120
that this is working it sounds funny but

00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:04,909
the main thing is is you say what's the

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,770
alternative okay and then you let him do

00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,630
their pitch right and they start they

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,490
don't have one you know and then you get

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,110
into like well we you know we're gonna

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,509
script this and script that and script

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,780
that and so yeah you know like one of

00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:19,460
our areas you know you have to deploy

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,199
kubernetes and everything you know all

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,969
these things so a bunch of scripts for

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,349
that then you have to deploy the product

00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,289
bunch of scripts for that and then you

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:30,080
have to deploy you have to hook our

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,909
products into a network an ecosystem a

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,550
bunch of scripts for that and if you can

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,970
show that I'm going to do it all through

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,970
one

00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:40,979
and show the flow and a nice easy to use

00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,710
everybody gets it and I can do these

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,920
Canaries yeah it's really there's

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,930
nothing you don't its let them fall on

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,150
their own face by trying to explain

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,880
what's the alternative because nobody's

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:57,380
got it and then so say you had a hundred

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,880
development teams like RIT which is huge

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,890
then what are they going to do each

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,690
one's gonna have a script right so

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,420
that's on the internal stuff now on the

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,770
external stuff what are they gonna do

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,150
every person that gets a product they're

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,740
gonna say oh I got a different script

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,930
from you right and then they're gonna be

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,160
like confused on you know I bought two

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,140
of your products and they use different

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,610
things so thank you that consistency

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,980
that stimulation

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,780
okay so phase one built cultural

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,610
alignment on kind of the principles

00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,160
behind this and then phase two create

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,140
that that golden path of production with

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,990
guardrails and not gates but don't don't

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,200
mandate that that teams have to use this

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,760
but let let them basically try whatever

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,850
other alternatives they might have and

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,550
just have best cake having examples of

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,740
best practices of application teams that

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,420
are early adopters being successful yeah

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:53,640
and it all just shakes out yeah I think

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,920
you know Netflix has explained that many

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,440
times about how you know when you see

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,140
you know hundreds of people having

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,820
success with this and being able to I

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,080
will start spinning it right and then

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,880
you're like oh you're gonna go build

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,000
your own thing and then it just becomes

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,190
crazy at some point nobody will do it

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,280
yeah the other thing is I I do think

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,750
there's more and more I don't know

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,820
people are tired of messing with

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,140
infrastructure you know people don't

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,360
want to you know how many times can you

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,940
you know figure out how to do Kafka

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,800
messagebox or whatever right and so they

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,720
they just want to get out of it you know

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,930
they want to build their micro services

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,220
that add value and bring in revenue they

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,900
don't want to spend their time on the

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,320
infrastructure and so people are more

00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:41,050
willing I think than ever to to follow a

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,420
good success story okay so let's look

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,730
towards the future as vinegar revolves

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,220
what are some of the things that you you

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,310
hope to see or some of the ways that you

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,930
hope to see spinnaker grow or that

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:57,150
you're helping helping make that happen

00:10:52,930 --> 00:11:02,230
if ya pacific things yeah I think for us

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:07,120
one is just there's a lot of when you're

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:08,620
out monitoring things you know you know

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,260
like they were talking about Canaries

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,300
today there was a talk and I was

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,370
thinking during it you know like you do

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,170
this quick canary and you say it's okay

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,730
and then you deploy it but then what are

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,430
you doing after that I mean why don't

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,440
you just monitor it forever with that it

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,870
keeps the canary go and you know and I

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,320
think there's there's something there

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,270
around baselining you know once you have

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,510
deployed it baselining it and then

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,430
making sure it stays within you know the

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,590
constructs that you've defined because

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,750
it should it shouldn't go out it should

00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:43,660
always be passing the you know the

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,990
canary test and the other is we have a

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,190
lot of instances where there's

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,180
operational things going on somebody's

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,520
taking some down for maintenance

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,620
somebody's you know spending something

00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,770
new up or whatever and having that

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,840
operational kinda understanding the

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,900
operational environment where something

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,580
is happening is a lot different you know

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,770
whether it's happening one day here in

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,510
one region one day in another region and

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,230
we're trying to figure out well how do

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:14,360
you do that yeah in an you know and an

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,100
easy to do fashion and it's it seems

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,710
very difficult but I think that the

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,420
tooling that we're starting to see what

00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,820
canary I think it could help

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,620
so to so to play that back but I think

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,690
I'm hearing you say is you've got this

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,740
platform spinnaker that is taking all

00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,060
the development work and actually

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,770
getting it out of production with it

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,780
once it's in production you've got all

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,450
this operationalizing up at all this

00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,710
monitoring and to be able to take the

00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,180
data that's silent and those other

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,460
systems that record and build that back

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,490
in so that is a deployment so that you

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:46,220
understand it because you know you

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,010
you've got your like black box where

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,690
maybe you've got some probes that are

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,970
monitoring things you know like Kafka or

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,830
whatever and then you have your internal

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,660
product that's emitting wait box

00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:02,750
telemetry and and then but that just

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,210
tells you a bunch of data right so you

00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,630
need that operational context of what is

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,820
it doing at the point that the data has

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:14,090
meaning you know was there a peak load

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,390
for you know number abusers what's there

00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,950
a turn then it's actionable playing and

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,380
then how to even automate that and they

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,360
automate that but then how does

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,090
spinnaker as you're deploying you know

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,780
begin to have more operational

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:31,250
constructs of what phase you're in and

00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,570
when you when you're doing that I mean

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,490
one one interesting thing about what

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,530
what you're saying that I think of is

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,690
what's what what Netflix has have been

00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,580
sourced spinnaker is different than what

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,900
spinnaker is inside of Netflix instead

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,850
of Netflix there are a number of systems

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,320
that tie in right and that makes it not

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,340
just an engine that makes it smarter

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,260
right so there's an opportunity to and

00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,230
everybody's using you know like you guys

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,910
did I guess the data dog stuff but in

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,880
their data dog or Prometheus or

00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,280
something

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,900
metrics are there yeah one one fun thing

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,120
that we're doing with data dog and that

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,100
now that we had that integration we can

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,780
actually calculate SLA is on a per micro

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,870
service basis and now we can start using

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:13,020
data and SLA is to help make decisions

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,400
and what's impacting an SLA so it sounds

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,050
very similar to the types of things that

00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,120
you're saying it's not just have data

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,710
being you know output it they actually

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,600
turn that into actionable intelligence

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:25,130
and hopefully even build that automation

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:29,280
into the platform so that we get smarter

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,680
you know minor thing is that Netflix and

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,210
the like they're they're baking these AM

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,910
eyes and they have at the immutable

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:38,400
concept of love but we don't always do

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,530
it that way you know especially when

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,090
we're you know running in a private data

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,750
center and the like so we're more

00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:47,700
deploying containers and you know and

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,330
then replacing the containers and all

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,540
and it's a little bit of a different

00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,920
customers

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,550
you know they they're not going to want

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,680
to have a change every you know thousand

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,900
changes a day right they're like scared

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,610
to death right so yeah so you know

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,650
there's going to be more changes going

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,670
on and so we need to kind of understand

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:11,070
I think in spinnaker for these changes

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:14,010
that are a bit more there's you know

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,649
maybe it's bad but there's a few things

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,259
going on you know

00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:20,089
are being changed at the same time and

00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:24,740
what's the impact on each other versus

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:27,680
just treating everyone as a immutable

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,809
process right so or we have to learn how

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,139
to do more immutable processing one or

00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:31,519
the other

00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,689
yeah yeah well it sounds like there's a

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,759
lot of opportunity for growth that'd be

00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:36,889
fun yeah to do this again next year and

00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,220
yeah yeah and here how this this

00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:42,170
upcoming year yeah when you look at last

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,600
year I don't know how many companies

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,839
were there but I'm sure there's more

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,970
time there's 150 last year it's 350 yeah

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,369
this year I better go more than double

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,589
again next year yeah and a lot cuz I I

00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:56,749
noticed a lot of people are there's a

00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:58,699
lot of the veterans here too but there's

00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:02,269
a lot of people that are just trying to

00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:05,149
learn there's a big there's a lot more

00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,619
new people here this year last year was

00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:10,069
mostly people that were already in on it

00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:12,829
are already contributing and I think

00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:15,199
people want to contribute and you know

00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:16,999
and I think it's good you know like to

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,300
have the talk on how how can you

00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:22,189
contribute with yeah I mean you can't

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,749
just take take take I mean I got to give

00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,790
back or else it's not much of a

00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,800
community right that's just you know

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,899
it's just like another product well it's

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,519
amazing to hear you all right I'm a big

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,949
company Cisco going to ask allow

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,209
transformation journey and then being so

00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:37,610
open source friendly it's just really

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,230
really yeah we're trying innovative so

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,420
if you are thinking about bringing

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,279
spinnaker into your organization people

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,079
like Brian in the community that are

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,600
going through it themselves and have a

00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:48,860
lot of a lot of information to share and

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,319
also if you think about contributing

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,759
this is a very friendly community I know

00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:54,379
can be a little intimidating to see

00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,970
5,000 people in slack but all seem to

00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:59,179
know each other but very friendly people

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,790
here very quickly and it really helps to

00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:03,709
come to the shows and to meet the people

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,420
face to face because it's such a

00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:08,339
difference it makes the

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,049
the slack channels so much better when

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,150
somebody knows who you are yeah you know

00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:14,040
versus just another it's nice to put a

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,540
face to it slice right that's right all

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,260
