hey it sturdy with armory and I'm here

00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,250
with Maggie and Polly introduce yourself

00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,650
hi my name is Maggie Nutter vol I work

00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,630
on less vinegar UI at Google alright so

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,519
you are pretty new to Google I think

00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,230
passed a couple months is that right yes

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,540
just joined end of August okay awesome

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,850
so tell us your story how is it that you

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,860
ended up working on this project that

00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,300
you know did you come to Google to work

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,880
on spinnaker did you just happen to do

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,860
it watched it yeah great question

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,020
so at Google you interviewed generally

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,370
for Google and only after you pass are

00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,400
you matched with a team so I'd actually

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,690
never heard of spinnaker I am from an

00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,240
engineer so don't have a ton of DevOps

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,400
background but was really excited about

00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,870
what the team was doing I was excited

00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,060
about working on an open source project

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,570
and really like to all the team members

00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,310
so that's how I ended up on spinnaker

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,320
it's been very different than my past

00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,570
role which was working on web and mobile

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,400
for b2b and it's been really cool to

00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,200
work with so many other to use at

00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,649
different companies on an open-source

00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,479
project in a community I think it's a

00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,100
really unique development in that way

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,590
yeah it's cool ok so what are you

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,260
working on right now questions I'm

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:15,520
working on some updates to the canary

00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,350
stage and the UI so look forward to

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,080
those if you are a Prometheus user in

00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,150
particular I'm very cool and if I'm

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,190
watching this and I am somebody who is

00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,830
just starting to learn about spinnaker

00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:29,710
maybe I'm a cloud architect at a company

00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,479
how would you describe spinnaker to me

00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,280
if I don't know a lot about it but I'm

00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,049
curious about it and hearing hearing

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,360
things about it what how should I be

00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,580
thinking of spinnaker that's a really

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,140
good question and walnut I've been

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,470
asking other people as I try to

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,360
understand it myself I do feel like the

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,290
kind of like simple answer that's on the

00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,020
website but it's a tool for continuous

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,310
in a repeatable manner with multiple

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,720
cloud providers sort of sums it up I

00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,520
think the way I think of kind of like

00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,020
setting up a pipeline in my mind is like

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,240
okay to an order like I have this thing

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,610
I want to get it in the cloud like what

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,890
happens in between and how do I manage

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,690
that on a team so spinnaker kind of like

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,400
breaks that down into entities like okay

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,620
I have these tasks there in these stages

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,410
in these pipelines and sort of keeps

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,210
that in a lik cloud and storage agnostic

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,760
way so that no matter what your provider

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,490
is you can kind of like use this common

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,950
language of these like like first-class

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,950
indulgence of the things that build up

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,959
yeah make sense to me yeah well it only

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,250
recently made sense to me so I still

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,890
feel like it's making more sense every

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,500
day it definitely is kind of a lot of

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,500
surface area to be covered so I'm

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,080
working with it all day every day for

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,180
three months yeah it is a Fe big beefy

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,739
project yeah what are some of your hopes

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,630
for the project if we fast forward

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:57,030
whatever period of time six months a

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,310
year a couple of years what do you what

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,630
what defines success for spinnaker just

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,090
from it everything that you know that it

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,250
is your own personal perspective what

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,989
what do you hope to see whether it's

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,570
what the community looks like what the

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:15,299
project looks like um so with regards to

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,010
community I would hope that it would

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,750
increase in size so that like every year

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,580
when we go back to this vinegar summit

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,049
which is like an annual developer

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,310
conference around spinnaker that there

00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,049
just look more and more people who are

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,260
successful using it in production and

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:31,350
interested in using it production from

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,630
like a usability perspective I think it

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,950
would be awesome if like in a year from

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,200
now it were just like a little bit

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,370
easier to kind of like get set up on

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,780
your own

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,190
whether that comes from like better

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,470
documentation or just kind of like

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,970
easier paved paths I think that like

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,350
some things aren't as intuitive as they

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,540
could be right now so just kind of like

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,430
opening the door for like more less

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,890
devops experience companies to kind of

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,290
give it a shot it'll be awesome and then

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,090
I'm a UI engineer so like in my mind

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,220
that's most important and so I would

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,680
love for that just to be like gorgeous

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,350
it consistent everywhere Oh totally I

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,800
mean I am excited that you're working on

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,630
the UI piece because that single pane of

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,519
glass is spinnaker provides at that

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,620
visualization of infrastructure is

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,630
probably one of the big benefits that we

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,250
hear over and over over again you know

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,220
it's like yeah I can truly be the multi

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,840
target you know I get these safety out

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,840
of the box I get out of them Canaries

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,250
what robots etc but I can finally for

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,900
the first time actually visualize my

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,120
image it's amazing I think people just

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,830
really love that it's one of the big

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,660
different shaders I think that at least

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,290
we hear about all the time from yeah

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,360

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,889
so check very cool there's a lot of

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,600

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:42,600
be done there well thank you for sharing

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,870
slack team with about 5,000 people in it

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,430
it's been growing actually by the way

00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,750
it's great even to see from the first

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,370
