Playlist: Spinnaker Customer Stories
Description: 
	Jinesh from FreddieMac explains why he attended Spinnaker Summit and some of tells about FreddieMac's CI/CD Journey. They chose Spinnaker when evaluating the CDF's tools for continuous delivery and have used it as  to move engineers to a CD platform that integrates their toolchain into codified pipelines. He explains that the airgapping solution he set up wouldn't have been possible without the support of the Spinnaker community that his company's business and regulatory obligations required. Jinesh is super excited about Spinnaker's 2020 roadmap, as he sees better security practices around pipeline validation coming into place. He's also eager to explore Managed Delivery after seeing Emily Burns' talk and learning more about using declarative verbiage to codify pipelines and remove the hassle and risk from the developer experience.
