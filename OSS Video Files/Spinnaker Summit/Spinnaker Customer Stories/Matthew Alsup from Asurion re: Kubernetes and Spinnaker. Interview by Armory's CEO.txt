hey it's dirty Oh CEO at armory I'm here

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,759
with Matthew to introduce yourself

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,870
Matthew also I'm from sure iam so we

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,219
were just talking a little bit before we

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,629
started about where you are in your

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,000
spinnaker journey so maybe you could

00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:21,690
just rewind a little bit and talk about

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,660
how you you decided to try spinnaker

00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,210
where you are in the journey how that

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,300
kind of initial piece is going yes so we

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,170
had some homegrown kind of tools for for

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,899
software delivery and they started to be

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,780
less and less maintained and we started

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,329
to do a rewrite but then we heard about

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,969
spinnaker and you know I was kind of

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,069
told to check it out so I went and we

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,069
kind of did the normal like halyard on a

00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:52,499
VM and then we went to you know how

00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:55,589
you're distributed employment and then

00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:58,859
we kind of came up with a solution to

00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:01,199
deploy spinnaker with spinnaker yeah so

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,210
then we kind of added like

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,790
authentication authorization we got

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,590
canary analysis and now we're trying to

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,619
kind of pitch it as the solution to

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,130
various teams okay so basically you have

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,439
been doing a technically value so you

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,740
are you're confident within your team

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,549
that this is something that's worth

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,340
investing more in and trying to onboard

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,590
some applications to and argue are you

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,260
looking for the right to the first teams

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,260
with

00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,480
company to get on or do you have kind of

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,820
a first staff that you're using as a

00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,180
proof of concept or how are you working

00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,550
through that yes so the the first app to

00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,210
production in it was was actually a

00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,310
serverless app we do a lot of the leg

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,370
work through the serverless framework on

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,620
jenkins servers we're waiting on the ada

00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,330
ghost lambda integration so that'll be a

00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,340
little bit cool when that comes out and

00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,200
what what kind of deployment targets to

00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,720
use you have in the company

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,740
like what what what's your protection

00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:06,550
look like so we have been using ECS

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,320
we're looking to move to kubernetes so

00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:12,370
that's kind of part of the package deal

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,590
that we're trying to do and then having

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:18,940
kind of multi region deployments and

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,890
potentially multi-cloud at some point so

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,920
that's that's kind of what it's looking

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,920
like

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,790
I think well it's vinegar simply

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,280
simplify those so it's super interesting

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,050
that you chose server this app is as the

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,000
first

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,080
yeah let's dig into that a little bit

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,900
what what kind of drove that

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,690
decision-making process so honestly it's

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,340
kind of proximity to the team we work

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:46,540
very closely with with the team that

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,459
built the cerberus app so they they like

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,799
the orchestration pieces and they like

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,900
that you know lambda is coming down kind

00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,480
of pipes for skin occurs they wanted a

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,040
good beyond the platform that they felt

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,010
like a sure in his moving towards

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,290
talking about a forward leaning team

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,110
it's a pretty pretty progressive I don't

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,420
think I've heard of that as the first

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,459
PSC use case a before okay cool

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,959
are you deploying it to production today

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:17,189
with this spinnaker plus Jenkins

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,629
mix and does the team are they feeling

00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:20,969
the value of speaker do you think

00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,250
they're happy that they're your guinea

00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:26,849
pig is this is this like a success story

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,599
or how would you kind of describe what

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:33,030
what you've learned so far about I think

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,879
it's it's been a success I think it

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,389
definitely helps to be able to piece the

00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:41,730
different Jenkins components together

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:43,889
with with Orca kind of being the

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,079
backbone of that I think rebuilding that

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,389
kind of sophistication and orchestration

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,419
would be difficult so I think they're

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:55,439
they're pleased with that again the

00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:57,220
future prospects of future yeah what

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,260
what what do you think that

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,060
you need to do to be successful to get

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,770
the organization to adopt spinnaker the

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,810
applaud so if I'm like if I'm a cloud

00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,060
architect watching this this interview

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,370
and it's my job taking my company on a

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,440
cloud transformation journey and I'm on

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,720
the front end of that entire process

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,220
what what what what would you say you've

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,120
learned I mean it sounds like you're

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,070
you've chosen one very progressive team

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,750
just to start with what have you learned

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,320
about what it's going to take to get the

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,610
organization more broadly to adopt this

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,800
yes I think and this has kind of been

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,010
iterated a lot in this conferences it's

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:37,330
driving a culture of you know releasing

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:40,890
frequently and really wanting those like

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,690
high confidence high velocity releases I

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,580
feel like that's a big barrier so for us

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,260
it was it was nice to have that team

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,570
that was already kind of thinking that

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,210
way and already kind of driven chomping

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,190
at the bit yeah laughter yeah so so that

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:59,410
was that was really sweet sweet gig and

00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,480
even though you know I didn't quite fit

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,240
the feature set of spinnaker II didn't

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,940
fit the process and in the culture so

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,100
super interesting you you you decided to

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,800
start with the team that was the most

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,810
ready culturally instead of the team

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,540
that was most appropriate technically

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,669
yeah and it sounds like that was the

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,010
right decision it sounds like getting

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,720
them excited so that you can kind of

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,510
hold them up as the shining example

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,780
inside the

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,180
what's positive are you happy happy that

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,800
you made that choice sounds like it yeah

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,780
yeah and I definitely think that's

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,480
that's a big part is to be able to point

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,210
to success stories within the company

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,280
it's you know here's how you guys are

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,290
doing things and here's how this other

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,540
team is doing things and like look at

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:49,610
their look at the metrics that they have

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:51,940
look at you know the objectives for

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,530
their delivery process that they've met

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,420
have you crafted any before and after

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,790
success metrics around the old kind of

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,100
spit polish and tape in a duct tape

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,620
deployment approach with your homegrown

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,750
tooling versus versus a spinnaker in

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,460
terms of velocity or safety or ability

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,440
to do things like roll back or whatever

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,479
look whatever those things are they

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,659
might be important for your company

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,270
so that's something that and people talk

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:18,680
about this a lot here like kind of

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,599
building that business case with those

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,610
metrics so I think that's actually

00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,830
takeaway from this conference when these

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,729
two is to go back and kind of take these

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,999
teams that are a little bit more

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:31,789
stubborn yeah and really build a case

00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:34,849
for why this will improve the process

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,270
and kind of levy eight yeah I think so

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:37,550
too

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,949
one thing that we've done with with with

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,719
large and a global 2000 companies that

00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,610
are facing the same challenge same exact

00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:45,710
challenge with you know hundreds or

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,589
thousands of application teams is

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,689
actually a survey so we send out a

00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:53,360
survey to the application developers and

00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:55,939
we ask them to rank their pain on a

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,520
number of different axes so things like

00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,740
you know what's what frustrates do the

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,629
most you know is it number of manual

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,060
judgments or needing to go in front of

00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:07,639
CCR bees or you know inability to

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,219
rollback or inconsistent pooling or

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:13,339
whatever those things are and then we we

00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:15,259
use those survey results to pair the

00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:17,960
pain with what spinnaker can solve for

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,490
most effectively to help us find the

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,409
teams that aren't the most ready and

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,539
then we're using their actual data so

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,789
it's like hey you guys told us that you

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:27,289
had this pain we've got this pool and

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:29,240
platform that can help solve it but

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,970
sometimes that can help qualify that

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,710
and I think that's a good point because

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:37,580
do you really want to build a solution

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:41,889
that the developers want yeah you don't

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,889
want to just shove something throw

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,340
another kind of like philosophical point

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,009
around that from what you're saying is

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,110
to have a golden path of production with

00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,849
guardrails and not gates and it's like

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,490
hey this is what we're going to support

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:57,770
this is you know if you take this golden

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,410
path all you have to do is focus on

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,509
writing code and getting it out quickly

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,639
and we handle everything else if you

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:06,050
don't you don't have to use this golden

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,460
path we're gonna have to own it you're

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,009
gonna be the one carrying the pager

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,479
getting you know alerted it 2:00 in the

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,940
morning with his problem in production

00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:16,910
and and that can also help kind of the

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,169
more workouts to turn the team's see see

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,530
the light a little bit it's like oh I'll

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:24,860
just go to the path of least resistance

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,599
yeah and I think that was a s Netflix

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,110
has some blog posts about their paid for

00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,110
it approach

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,719
that really important our similar

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,580
decision thanks for sharing your story

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,169
is there anything else about spinnaker

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,909
if I'm watching this and I'm on the

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,490
front end of this journey anything else

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:46,220
that you wish you'd known or pro tips

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,600
about spinnaker just the value or also

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,490
things that you wish spinnaker did that

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,010
it doesn't do that if it did these

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,560
things that'd be so much better any

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,260
other last thoughts I guess yeah I mean

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,990
definitely there's a there's a heavy

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,550
lift on the front end I know the

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,560
documentation has gotten better in

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,900
y'all's documentation at our where he

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,260
has been if I that would be one thing

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:13,550
it's to look at armories that happy that

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,560
happy to share yeah yeah and just but

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,990
but it's worth it and once you kind of

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,800
get it rolling and you get a feel for

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:25,060
the services and like how they operate

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,820
that it's a pretty smooth forward

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,830
so it's a little bit of pain upfront but

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,330
it's worth it and then life is way

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,390
better on the other side of what I heard

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:39,580
you say you plugged into the best

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:41,960
practices where you're plugged into what

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,460
the community thinks is best you know
