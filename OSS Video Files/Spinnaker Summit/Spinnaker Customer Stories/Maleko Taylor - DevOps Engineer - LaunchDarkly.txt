all right hey it's Stroh do see you an

00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,460
armory I'm here with malleco Taylor a

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,860
DevOps engineer at lunch start day so

00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,360
you are just beginning your spinnaker

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,550
journey from what I understand long

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,650
start this is just now integrating

00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,210
spinnaker I'd love to know from someone

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,180
who doesn't drink the kool-aid I've been

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,950
in this ecosystem for years now someone

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,560
is just coming in what are your thoughts

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,110
about spinnaker I'm excited about

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,090
spinnaker I think it'll help our dev

00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,670
team hopefully get more comfortable with

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,590
deploy right now we are deploying from

00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,170
laptops and that's not scaling so well

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,899
now that we're growing I've been nice

00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,220
user interface it also I'm just being

00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:43,850
able to see like how things progressed

00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,820
from stage to stage it's so interesting

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,079
because we see global 2000 corporations

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,570
adopting spinnaker they have these

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,040
complex enterprise environments hundreds

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,960
or thousands of application teams and

00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,219
applications application developers all

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,690
going off the reservation to play in

00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:58,399
different ways and when a standardized

00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,290
have a golden cots production that's one

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,540
kind of one and of the spectrum and then

00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,519
your use case is a very rapidly growing

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,990
company it's looking to bring these

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,030
these tools in and the same

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,280
infrastructure in so you can better

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,590
scale yeah so what what was it about

00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,819
spinnaker that that interested you or

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,469
that caused launch I couldn't say I

00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:18,049
think this is something that we should

00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:20,750
look at versus like extending Jenkins

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,369
some other option I think we've had our

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,290
eye on spinnaker for a while since it

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,930
ever since they went first went open

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,909
source previously we had our own

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,770
homegrown solution so at that point in

00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:32,509
time we didn't make sense for us to sort

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,180
of jump ship and move into spinnaker I'm

00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,070
not this new company you don't have that

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,780
system that we had before and so we're

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,770
definitely looking at spinnaker to be

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,119
that system so what are some of the

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,610
things that concern you about the

00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,259
project as someone who's just coming in

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,030
things that you're just not sure about

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,740
or you don't have their support for you

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,700
don't know if it's gonna evolve in a way

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,649
that might work yeah there's lots of

00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,970
concerns I mean we're basically taking

00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:02,420
the first step into it

00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:05,299
officially we're starting this week so

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,560
just basically we're hoping to be able

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:08,239
to replicate all the things that we're

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
currently able to do with current

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,010
deployment system and then add on to

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,250
that like get all the more body that you

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,340
know we need out of and there's such a

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,959
great adjacent story with with armory

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,540
and launch darkly we should just talk

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,130
about that for a second because as as we

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,600
think about the soft board of my cycle

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,970
and what it takes to go from idea to

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,680
feature and prod generating revenue

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,299
there's all these systems of record

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,100
right there's you know have an idea

00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,989
break it up into units of work with JIRA

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,600
just encoding put it up in source

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,920
control do some CI on it deliver it out

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,570
to production but now that it's in

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,360
production be able to do feature

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:46,510
flagging on it so the

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,770
the armory and spinnaker part is company

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,050
should always be deploying to production

00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,700
and they should be using you know modern

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,770
best practice techniques like Canaria

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,900
deployments to limit blast radiuses and

00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,150
that's an engineering activity but then

00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,590
launch directly comes into play and for

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,210
anyone that's not familiar with with

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,800
launch darkly be great for you to talk

00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,520
to me about about what launch darkly

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,080
that's elapsed actually is a feature

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,760
management system we like to separate

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,430
releases from employees so like you can

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,220
know continuously deploy whatever but

00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,930
you know to enable some features you

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,520
don't have to redeploy something or to

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,980
disable features you don't need to point

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,630
again you just flip a flag all of a

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,250
sudden all those broken features go away

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,350
or all the new features that you like

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,060
come on so yeah it's awesome so if

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,760
you're watching this and you are

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,470
thinking about spinnaker I would highly

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,880
recommend also taking a look look at

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,800
launch darkly that's like a one-two

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,360
punch that will really help not only

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,850
your engineering teams but your product

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,250
teams also have a lot of self service

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,110
and control over the user experience so

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,150
that's that's pretty exciting really

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,910
cool all right anything else about

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:55,330
spinnaker that jumps to mind as you

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:59,010
start the exploration I'm not really

00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:02,860
just excited excited to you know I

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,350
really hope it works yeah well we will

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,720
help ensure your success that's what I

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:13,009
really does Thanks

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,009
