hey it's dirty OC of armory I'm here

00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:07,569
with Nick let's go ahead and introduce

00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,960
yourself I'm Nick Whittier I'm from

00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:12,519
hellosign I'm senior engineering manager

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,469
there I work with the dev ops and dev

00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,020
tooling teams all right so we were just

00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:18,520
talking we were just talking before the

00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,350
center of you started about how you've

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,120
been at hello science since almost the

00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:27,700
beginning and originally on Asgard talk

00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,940
a bit about that bringing as guard in

00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,370
and or a bit about the origin story sure

00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,340
yeah we we were actually too small to

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,140
really justify Asgard yeah but I was

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,060
enthusiastic about immutable

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,180
infrastructure and implementation in

00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,970
Asgard so we went kind of all in in

00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,770
rewriting the absolute minimum of the

00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,800
Asgard functionality that we would need

00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,750
in order to sort of do cloud right and

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,840
that has carried us through with a whole

00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,040
lot of success for several years and

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,020
about the time we were getting big

00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,680
enough to really think about a proper

00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,020
Asgard

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,540
implementation and installing as guard

00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,190
and going all in yeah it was kind of the

00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,409
point when a scart was no longer

00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,800
maintained because spinnaker was coming

00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:14,140
and so as spinnaker came and is slowly

00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,030
starting to reach a level of maturity

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,979
that I think really warrants the

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,570
installation we're feeling real gung-ho

00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:20,680
about getting it in place and it's up

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,030
and running in our infrastructure

00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,940
all right so we'll talk about spinnaker

00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,640
in a second but so you started in 2012

00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,440
at hellosign and you were just

00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,750
passionate about Asgard this is a

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,460
high-growth startup so didn't really

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,710
have the complexity or the me to bring

00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,590
something like Asgard in but when the

00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,140
time was right you basically rebuilt the

00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,510
minimum required to get you to today

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,250
essentially how is that accurate like

00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,210
how much growth did you have with that

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,710
internal tooling

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,630
and when did you start seeing it to

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,360
seeing it break down and if you thought

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,910
okay it's time to go out and look for

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,250
some peers when we first implemented the

00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,320
technology it was managing something

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,670
like five nodes

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,940
I have unique nodes and deploy

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:07,550
mechanisms two of which managed a

00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,140
software development repository the

00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,500
others need more infrastructure and

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,840
back-end oriented at this point and as

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,660
we're implementing spinnaker and looking

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,180
to transition it's more like 65

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,330
different node types and hundreds of

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,930
servers during that time the the DevOps

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,209
team went from me to we're now a team of

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,270
six people that are working in and

00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:34,820
around deployments and see ICD oh and

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,220
what targets are you deploying attitude

00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,709
we're entirely in AWS okay and we are

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,209
using exclusively Amazon machine images

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:43,160
so we're not we're not quite taking

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,440
advantage of kubernetes we won or b2

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,020
it's on the radar and it's a selling

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,480
point for us because we know that it

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,160
will be of interest but at the moment

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,860
we're focused entirely on a consistent

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,959
deployment through baked images okay so

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,030
if I'm a cloud architect watching this

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,769
or let's say that I'm at a smaller

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,480
company and and I'm just trying to

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:04,970
decide when is the right time to bring

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,730
spinnaker in the spinnaker is a beefy

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,500
big beefy heavy system and it's uh it's

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,410
not something that at least we as armory

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,090
usually target to smaller companies

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,590
I'd love to kind of know what that

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,239
decision-making process was for you to

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,459
say okay our tooling is breaking down

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,530
what were the symptoms they were seeing

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:25,700
and what made spinnaker the right answer

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:27,620
sure our tooling to credit the tooling

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:31,549
and accredit a scar the tooling was

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,549
still working but upon reflection it

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:37,010
wasn't as efficient a solution as a

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,590
proper Asgard or spinnaker solution can

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,400
be and I'll point out a couple of

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,430
factors one is cost

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,230
when you're small and your user base is

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,750
small enough that a couple of servers in

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,269
the cloud are functioning fine and

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,610
supporting your user base it's overkill

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,250
to spin up an m8 extra large whatever

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,680
fancy new instance type you need to run

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,120
spinnaker with you know 16 32 gigs

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,370
around yeah that's more than your

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,500
service is running you probably don't

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,090
have a standalone Jenkins or a circle CI

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,829
that's really doing all that much at

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,810
that point and you really can't take

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:11,940
advantage of a lot of what a spinnaker

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,910
like solution would offer you in my

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,549
opinion as we were growing we got to the

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:21,180
point where audit compliance regulations

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,530
and the necessity for accountability and

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,889
auditability started to become more

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,630
important and as we were going kind of

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,960
above and beyond bending over this way

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,539
and that in order to account for who did

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,220
what when they did it and where they did

00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:39,210
it we started to realize that at this

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,520
point we're not working with this MVP

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,280
asgard implementation we're rebuilding

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,820
spinnaker and when we made that decision

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,740
in that realization it was time and that

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,139
was when we started spinning up you know

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,610
demo installs a spinnaker to see what it

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,260
would look like and start to try to sell

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,450
it within our organization okay so let's

00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:02,099
talk a bit about that how long ago did

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,810
you start on your spinnaker journey well

00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:06,210
if you check the commit history on my

00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:12,599
github repo with the demo that I talked

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:14,580
about earlier it was about a year ago

00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:16,530
and then probably more like six months

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,840
ago we started getting pretty serious

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:23,580
about it we're experiencing high growth

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:26,130
and as kind of a founding member of the

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,949
DevOps group at hellosign I wanted to

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,229
make sure that we could move forward in

00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,270
a way that didn't require linear growth

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:34,770
with the engineering team as a whole to

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,110
support them and that's where

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,240
productizing delivery as a service comes

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,039
into place standardizing on pipelines

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,470
and really coming up with this product

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,990
that you can support instead of all of

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,580
these users they

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,020
and it abstracts things away and gives

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,940
us the ability to grow and what I

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,880
consider to be a more productive way

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,470
so why Weiss why spinnaker why not some

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,120
other solution and then obviously you've

00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,970
got the Asgard background for you

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,200
personally so maybe that was an

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,510
evolution there but you know there's a

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,460
lot of different options and you see the

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,880
tools on the market so what mates gonna

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,550
do it

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,170
I think the Asgard bit is a little bit

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,540
of a red herring it made it convenient

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,550
for us to change but if you take a few

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,940
steps back I think it's clear that from

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,670
cloud hosting perspective spinnaker

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,460
enforces appropriate cloud methodology

00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,400
it's gonna help you do the right thing

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,590
and use the cloud in the cloudy way

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,230
which is a huge selling point for us

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,780
we're in Amazon Web Services we were

00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,150
packing and deploying in this immutable

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,360
infrastructure technique using Amazon

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,130
machine images and we're not ready and I

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,260
don't feel like containers are a

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,510
solution for us right now so we couldn't

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,280
make this bump right two containers if

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,650
you want to look at some of the kind of

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,930
competitor tooling around CI CD that

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,450
reaches as far as spinnaker does in

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,400
terms of feature set many of them are

00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,680
container only they're gonna force you

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,340
into kubernetes if that can work for you

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,990
those are an option for us we needed to

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,820
be able to bake Amazon machine images

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,580
and do it reliably in spinnaker can do

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,560
that it also has in its back pocket the

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,570
capability to hit containers when we're

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,310
ready for need it and it also has the

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,620
multi cloud option that's baked in and

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,910
arguably a more mature way than a lot of

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,150
the other options that are out there is

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,220
that something that you

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,830
would seriously consider how important

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,020
is multi-cloud in your thinking the

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,640
strategy moving forward are you very

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,680
happy just to go ahead of us

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:33,580
multi clouds not currently a priority

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,470
for our team for teams that are in a

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,410
hybrid implementation or multi public

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,910
cloud or one a long-term transition from

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,560
bare metal or from one cloud to another

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,720
those are huge

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,750
it's not a selling point for us it's

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,330
kind of a back pocket perk if we decided

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,400
that some service or some utility made

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,160
more sense in a different place we're

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,260
not bound yeah so she's spinnaker was a

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,850
way for you to modernize your

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,430
infrastructure without having to rebuild

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,200
it yourselves and and gives you a path

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,000
to containers when you're ready for it

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,800
or whatever might come next whether it's

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,710
lambda or you know you just did it

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,400
sounds like that that was a valuable

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,920
aspect that was a spinnaker also sure I

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,740
think in terms of soft sells to a lot of

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,530
your your technical users that's huge

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,270
yeah extensibility flexibility the fact

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,770
that it's clearly forward-facing and

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,350
ready to accommodate these new

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,120
technologies a lot of your users that

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,880
maybe aren't at the sea level making a

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,350
final decision or aren't buried under

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,240
technical debt are gonna be really

00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,220
inspired by this concept with the tool

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,410
you're choosing feels like it's facing

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,630
the right direction yeah yeah okay so

00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,090
you've been at it for a year and really

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,250
added filler for six months how has the

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,710
experience been with spinnaker and what

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,820
what were closely have in production are

00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,860
you in production yet how would you

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,900
describe how much success you've had or

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,200
whether it's been successful it's

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,570
definitely been successful we alluded to

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,730
this but we were in probably a

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,650
comfortable position to begin with so

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,810
the the transition was one that was

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,520
expected to be smooth and it turned out

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,410
to be fairly smooth along the way we

00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,690
certainly ran into some challenges but

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,330
those are kind of small speed bumps and

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,640
not major roadblocks

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,870
in terms of production we're pushing a

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,580
few notes your productions your

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,670
spinnaker right now and we're working

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,410
actively to push more of our flagship

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,180
products into non production

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,310
environments that using spinnaker

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,230
pipelines and the key there is just

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,140
following this trajectory that we've

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,270
been pushing to really sell our various

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,550
groups and teams on the concept of

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,220
spinnaker on the concept of delivery

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,660
deployment pipelines that can assure us

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,850
and give us the confidence in our

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,680
artifacts such that our deployments can

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,720
be as automated as is possible within

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,730
our constraints at that point we're

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,170
really saving time and getting the

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,600
success that I think we should be able

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,490
to get out of spinnaker right now I

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,980
think we're tracking in a good direction

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,080
so you continue that movement movement

00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,420
and get more and more of our products

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,270
and projects in the spinnaker to where

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,550
virtually 100% so do you have any hard

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,950
metrics on you mentioned that your

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,080
tooling was was fine but it wasn't as as

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,820
efficient as it could be do you have any

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,280
hard metrics on what spinnaker is

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,870
enabling either is enabling today or

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,370
what you expect the Delta will be

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,650
between what the homegrown tooling

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,560
versus spinnaker however you're defining

00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,500
those metrics sure well I think for us

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,360
we don't have strong metrics on the

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,240
savings that we expect vinegar to

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,980
provide us the challenges that we were

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,490
facing with our sort of homebrew

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:39,480
implementation we're mostly around roles

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:42,360
and our back audit concepts and

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,040
centralization of data in terms of what

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,260
happened when and where and those are

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,940
places where I think there's a little

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,010
bit of work to do on role based access

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,570
control in spinnaker and there are a lot

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,640
of people that are moving forward with

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,020
it I have high hopes for what will

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,570
happen over the course of the next few

00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,780
months in that area and in terms of

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:03,930
audit using you know web hooks or

00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,800
pub/sub or even something like the JIRA

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,769
integration to

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,500
a healthy amount of the data we need to

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:13,480
a single point of truth where our audits

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,730
can happen are key and those are areas

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,040
where spinnaker is kind of ready to

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,470
solve the problem for us as opposed to

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,850
continuing to deal with our mechanisms

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,130
for pulling all of that data from our

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,570
home yeah I mean it sounds like I was

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,040
just about to ask you what your what

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,300
your hopes were for the project as it

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
evolves it sounds like there's a lot

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,600
that's already on the road map your

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,490
spinnaker yeah you'll be able to benefit

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,000
from is there anything else that you

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,260
that you wish spinnaker could do or if

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,060
I'm watching this and I'm thinking about

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,790
getting involved and contributing in

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,050
some way what are the the unsolved pain

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,459
points that you think spinnaker could

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,970
could be a solution for but it's not

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:51,790
today sure I think for our purposes were

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,160
modeled around the early concepts in

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,050
spinnaker and so it's on a really good

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,709
track with some of those simple kind of

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:02,019
compliance oriented enhancements yep

00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:04,510
in terms of the general community I

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:07,390
think there's a sense that kind of

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,730
evening out the support levels for the

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,950
various cloud providers and artifacts

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,350
that are out there as options yeah that

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,310
would be well-received because a lot of

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,920
times what's happening as does happen in

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:23,170
a community driven project is someone

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,880
needs a feature and they implement a

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,010
feature but if they only need that

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,140
enhancement in OpenStack it's only an

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,910
OpenStack and if I'm not an openstack

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,130
then that can be problematic for me to

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,990
get access to that feature

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,029
I think that's a difficult challenge and

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,069
one that's not unique to spinnaker yeah

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,110
well if you're watching this and you

00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:42,000
want to get more involved please do we

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,620
would welcome you in this vinegar

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,870
community you can go to join that's

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,709
vinegar god I owe and thank you for

00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,690
sharing your story

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:51,060
best of luck I'm super curious to see

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,560
how the next year goes with some of the

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,600
functionality that's coming to spinnaker

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,389
it sounds like that'll be great to watch

00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,220
this interview next year at the summit

00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:01,470
and you could talk about what's in front

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,180
of us right now and also how all right

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:08,460
thank you sir yeah thanks a lot

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,460
