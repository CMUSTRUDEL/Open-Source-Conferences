hey it's Joe DLC of armory I'm here with

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:14,630
Stephen go ahead and tell everybody who

00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:17,269
you are so some would say that this this

00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,150
whole community in conference today it's

00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:24,640
kind of it's it's it's like your progeny

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,640
that's it's evolving into the world

00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,600
[Music]

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:38,179
style what what was it about spinnaker

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,590
that made you really excited to get get

00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:41,750
involved at Google involved really

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,800
support the project when you first

00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:48,699
started looking at it a couple years ago

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,699
I've always maintained

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,880
those solutions for this problem space

00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,460
of continuous delivery but I really do

00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,890
think that spinnaker takes a unique

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:08,580
theory on it but also I think we've

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,369
taken an interesting and a vast majority

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,820
of what we tried to do in the continuous

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,280
delivery space had been tethered to real

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,110
organizations real companies who are

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,600
proving this out we are working it out

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,790
as a community on what works what

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,970
doesn't work that's been very very

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,200
special in validating for every yard

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,759
that we've taken out there and I also

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,920
believe that you know continuous

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,780
delivery is a necessary question that

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,250
all organizations who are moving to

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,970
filed have to face because it's a couple

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,570
minutes apart doors

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:54,650
so whether they're making from on-prem

00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,720
to cloud or kubernetes from being base

00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,690
whatever it might be that shrek

00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,480
necessitates the question of alright how

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,670
are we going to do this how are other

00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:09,350
organizations doing it so it's a very

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:12,140
opposite what makes spinnaker has a

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:14,350
project and then of course fall camera

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,350
here

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,740
if if if I'm somebody who's just hearing

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,650
about spinnaker and I'd like to get more

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,810
involved what's the best way to do that

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,340
it can be a bit intimidating there's a

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,980
there's a slack team it feels like

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,190
everybody in there knows each other but

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,570
maybe I'm also passionate like you about

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,700
contributing what what would you

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,680
recommend to somebody that is interested

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:47,980
but unsure yeah that's something that we

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:49,750
have been very good about we're at a

00:02:47,980 --> 00:03:07,750
point now where we need to do that much

00:02:49,750 --> 00:03:10,290
better he said you know what

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,290
with evidence

00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:17,390
what that looks like and so there's

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,890
documentation website spinnaker at i/o

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:23,690
and really we're just trying to make

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:27,420
sure his parents what captain going on

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,610
so that's not between you know just a

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,050
back door and then shake between some

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,820
close people that's been very valuable

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,770
they'll continue to be valuable that

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,080
trusting the community is there but we

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,760
need a scale so on that page you can go

00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,270
ahead and figure out how to get engaged

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,820
we give some suggestions as well as

00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:47,370
specific tangible go to take on and the

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,040
community to take increased stewardship

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,320
of the project on the ground the

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,200
codebase making contributions but also

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,050
on a management capacity whether it's

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,630
special interest groups and identifying

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,850
specific areas that the community needs

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,080
to focus on like we have one around

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,720
kubernetes which is obviously very

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,840
important to the project but also like

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,780
I'd like to see sig start up around

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,849
see I interactions very adjacent

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,459
neighbor of the CV process we need to

00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,750
get that interaction right and

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,100
everything else from UI to the

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,169
documentation to whatever like so that's

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,370
one and then of course there is a

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,200
technical oversight committee and a

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,669
steering committee if that's something

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,290
that you have passion for and you have

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:32,250
experience and if you like you can go to

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,530
contribute to the project what what are

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,700
some of the the big unsolved problems

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:41,310
that you'd like to see people tackle so

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:50,520
maybe maybe an ordered list of top I

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:52,620
think it's like source code all the way

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,220
out to deploy min and operationalizing

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,870
the entire thing and it's a big suit and

00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,490
I think because to make soup is the

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,020
reason why some of the approach that

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,520
we've taken is so for example taking the

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,710
things that I've been very successful in

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,729
a CI realm and simply extending that

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,729
single CD

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,650
especially when you get to a certain

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,840
scale right and so I think that there's

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:20,050
a lot of information in that suit a

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,240
certain subset of it which is very

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,860
important to continuous delivery so as a

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,990
community we have to get very good at

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:30,010
understanding identifying what are the

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,420
key pieces to us what are the boundary

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,430
systems that we need to go to an

00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,550
interactive with that contract looks

00:05:33,430 --> 00:06:04,150
like one thing down to the EPI is and

00:05:36,550 --> 00:06:06,190
the interaction what about you you

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,900
personally or your team at Google what

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,880
are some of your areas of focus that

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,160
people that are looking at the project

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,670
can can expect to see how it evolves

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,240
based on the leadership of Google and

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,190
and others yeah you know Google's

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,370
participation in your OSS project which

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,150
has always been very very heavy is in

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,150
some ways a new

00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:39,129
projects and so governance was something

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,379
I was tweeting meaning to us then we go

00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:43,179
and it's it's so heavily at least

00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:45,610
initially on an external project that is

00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:47,409
very meaningful to us we'll talk about

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:54,759
some of this later in the conference as

00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:58,179
well we sure about so we're breaking a

00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,009
lot of new ground internally so what's

00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:02,800
really important once again is to have

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:04,659
the right the meta conversations because

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,479
there there are things about how Google

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:09,849
views things like the ways like

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,409
continuous delivery some of which we

00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:13,330
hope to go and invest into the spinnaker

00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:14,559
project sometimes I'll go the other

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,469
direction too we're learning from the

00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,669
outside community as well so that's a

00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:22,029
really important that we do that way

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,240
okay and what if I'm a cloud architect

00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:27,399
or a leader at a global 2000 company

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,139
tasked with clouds transformation and

00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,459
I'm just starting to learn about

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,579
spinnaker I'm watching this video now

00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:37,209
what what would you say to that person

00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:39,639
to help them figure out the right

00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:41,439
decision matrix for evaluating spinnaker

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,149
in their environment what are some of

00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,740
the things that you think spinnaker is

00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:45,740
especially good at or that they should

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,730
really be thinking of

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:55,310
one thing that I really made up call to

00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:59,450
action in infamy in the space is that we

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:04,340
have to be a culture of function to

00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:07,250
simplify and I think one mistake that we

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:10,670
would make with it as well is simply

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:14,110
force the complexity moving to the cloud

00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,110
or moving the communities for example

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:21,950
and so I feel any more incredible burden

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,620
and responsibility for the spinnaker

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,290
community to hit that get here very well

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:31,130
which is what is the ideal operating

00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,900
level of 5000 Aftab developers at your

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,980
organization what do they need to be

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:40,400
able to be able to focus on and then how

00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:42,800
much is there get to effectively run on

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,630
the pump these platforms are obviously

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,120
incredibly empowering but the cuts

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:50,240
complexity so you have to ask the

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,270
questions do you how much ramp up do you

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,010
need your 5,000 app dev developers to do

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,360
for them to be productive for the

00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,490
business

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,790
so hopefully spinnaker alone isn't

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,860
tackling that yeah but that gap exists

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,860
and it's very incredibly important 34

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,959
well it's been amazing to be a part of

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:14,709
this growing community and just watching

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,089
it become more and more successful and

00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:21,339
more and more obvious that spinnaker

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:23,229
will fill this slot in the sdlc and and

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:24,249
you know organizations like armory I

00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:27,609
mean a part of that complexity is

00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:29,709
vinegar right and so operating and

00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:37,839
running spinnaker is a subject matter

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:41,169
expertise in itself customers make that

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:48,189
Trek Enterprise carry continuous

00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:49,209
delivery it is a check likewise man

00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:51,620
thank you sir

00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:55,870
appreciate it

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,870
