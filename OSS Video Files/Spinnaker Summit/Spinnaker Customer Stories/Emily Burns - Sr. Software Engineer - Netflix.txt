all right hey it's video see a CEO of

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,290
armory I'm here with Emily why don't you

00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:10,240
introduce yourself hi I'm Emily burns I

00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,799
work at Netflix I'm an engineer on the

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,870
delivery engineering team we work on

00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,900
spinnaker all right what what is your

00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,390
history with spinnaker so I started out

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,220
in the open source community which was

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,810
awesome I got to know spinnaker and

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,360
contribute to it while I was working at

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,010
a previous company and then I got to

00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,720
know the team and when I was looking for

00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,190
a new opportunity I joined Netflix and

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,020
I've been at Netflix for the past year

00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,060
that's so awesome so what was it about

00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,610
spinnaker that that drew you in

00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,900
originally why why did you get excited

00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,800
about it in the first place but you were

00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,910
on the outside I loved tools and

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,860
deploying to the cloud is hard and

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,310
deploying is messy and you have to know

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,470
so many different pieces and I saw a

00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,470
spinnaker and when I started to use it I

00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:56,860
was like wow this is easy this is cool

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,390
like this makes my life better and so

00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,160
selfishly I like software tools because

00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,899
I like to work on things that make my

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,210
life easier yeah it makes a lot about

00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,710
other people's lives yeah that's the

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,060
most rewarding part seeing the people in

00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,030
the community and interacting with them

00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,350
and hearing like oh this like helps my

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:17,140
day how about now that you're at Netflix

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:23,770
what what what are you working on inside

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:27,549
Netflix parodies or I'm working on a

00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:29,020
couple of things right now so um as you

00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,600
know spinnaker deploys things to the

00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,170
cloud we deploy a lot of things all the

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,150
time and we need to clean them up

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,340
because it has a huge cost for indexing

00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,920
the cloud it makes things slow and so

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,500
I've been working for the past couple of

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,430
months on a clean up service that's part

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,310
of spinnaker

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,870
so enabling people to define rules about

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,960
when you want to clean up we're starting

00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:55,480
with images and then I've been working

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,060
on some Amazon pub/sub stuff integrating

00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,090
with existing services at Netflix and

00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,590
I'll be working on declarative delivery

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,200
coming up at the end in the corner

00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,850
that's awesome what about if I am

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,520
somebody who is just learning about

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,230
spinnaker I want to get more involved

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,240
but it's like it's a little bit of an

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,800
intimidating thing there's 5,000 people

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,050
on Flag they all seem to know each other

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,980
what what should I do what what's the

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,150
right or the best way to get involved in

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,260
[Music]

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,290
that's something I'm really passionate

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,540
about I'm giving a talk tomorrow called

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,459
we want you to contribute which is kind

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,079
of about that exact question like how do

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,060
you get involved how can you be a part

00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:35,579
of the community from more more than

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,459
just an observer setting so I would say

00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:40,980
like if you want to get involved in the

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,349
code like we love help on documentation

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,329
we love help on like verifying PRS and

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,760
commenting and forcing your code

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,590
standards testing out new features we

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,959
have people asking all the time like hey

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,049
can you test out this with your setup

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,579
and just don't be afraid to like talk to

00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,260
us everyone's really nice everyone's

00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,750
helpful everyone wants you to be there

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,389
yeah so we appreciate all the help we

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,040
can get yeah that's great I think just

00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:07,859
seeing this video and putting a face to

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,389
ass like handle helps yeah what about

00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,220
what are some of the areas that you

00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,530
would love to see people get involved in

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,540
contributing maybe things you wish

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,530
spinnaker could do or just areas of need

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,909
yeah don't like the documentation like

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,549
let's say that I'm going to get serious

00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:26,519
about really being involved but what big

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:32,159
initiatives I think there's a lot to be

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:34,319
done around the concept of artifacts and

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,060
kind of integrating with other services

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,540
and so something that I've been thinking

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,790
about with Eric Z from Google is like a

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,739
better way to represent the things that

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,540
flow through spinnaker spinnaker has

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,220
been around for a while and now we're

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,079
starting to realize like oh be great to

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,269
have visibility into these pieces and to

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:53,370
be able to like refer to them in a way

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,560
that's not just strings but that's messy

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,169
so there's a lot of area of opportunity

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,239
there for like work and all the services

00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:01,620
and visualization which would be really

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,659
helpful so the question that I would

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,510
love to be able to see in spinnaker is

00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,209
like what commit is on that instance and

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,159
see how that flew like went through all

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,110
the pipeline so it flows especially for

00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,990
auditing

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,690
yeah it'd be helpful everywhere for

00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:20,450
teams for auditing for like any anyone

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,240
so that's a really cool area all right

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,310
well if you are passionate about tying

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,110
disparate data sets together and you

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,670
want to get commit data into spinnaker

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,810
in a deeper way here is your opportunity

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:35,510
to do it definitely join the slack team

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,020
