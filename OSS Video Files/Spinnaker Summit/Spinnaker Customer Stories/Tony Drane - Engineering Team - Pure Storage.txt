hey it's triggy a CEO at armory I'm here

00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,559
with Tony going to introduce yourself hi

00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,240
I'm Tony drain I'm the engineering

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,040
manager at pure stores that's

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,920
responsible for a slight liability

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,930
engineering

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,390
all right so let's talk spinnaker okay

00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,460
I'd love to hear how did peer storage

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,870
started spinnaker journey and what was

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,250
it about spinnaker as compared to

00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,920
anything else that you were evaluating

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,170
that made it the winner for you sure

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,930
when I first joined pure a couple years

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,900
ago one of the first things I did was

00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,120
assess you know the root cause of a lot

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:40,310
of outages that we had post-mortems

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,500
right so we were using salt to deploy

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,120
systems the police services and

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,890
applications and we were just having a

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,800
whole ton of post-mortems as a result of

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,850
using salt and doing configuration

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,500
management or live learning systems so

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:57,320
what I did was I worked with my tech

00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,660
lead Ben turn and we decided to adopt

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,379
spinnaker the notion of being able to

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:06,950
deploy bootable machine images to Amazon

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:09,470
a mice that we could be repeatably

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,510
and reliable and that really improved

00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,340
our reliability story okay and how long

00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,860
ago did you start your spinnaker journey

00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,380
about eighteen months ago okay great so

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,600
early yeah pretty early adopter and

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,890
where is pure storage now in that

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,350
journey and what percentage of your

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:28,009
workloads are on spinnaker how's that

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,960
adoption process so the adoption was a

00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:33,340
little difficult to begin with because

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:37,130
the mayor before me just typically saw

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,579
so I joined pure and all of a sudden

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,380
we're going to roll out a new

00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:46,430
configuration management system the

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:49,399
developers like oh man really a new one

00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,750
yeah so but willing then we started

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,910
showing the value of spinnaker

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,840
we started showing how the services that

00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:00,060
we were deployed through spinnaker were

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,550
being deressa laws and their SLA versus

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,490
the services that worked that really

00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,990
helped us private option I'd love to dig

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,610
deeper in that so if I'm a cloud

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,679
architect watching this I'm on the front

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,510
end of this journey and I'm trying to

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,820
decide do I stick with kind of a spit

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,710
polish and tape mutable configuration

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,270
management tooling or do I do I tear all

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,160
that out and replace it with a platform

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,050
like spinnaker drive towards a mean

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,850
ability let's just start from a cultural

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,440
perspective well it sounds like that's

00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,720
where you where you had to really really

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,490
start change changing parts and mines so

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,170
yeah so did you start with one

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,260
application and kind of show success

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,640
around that or exactly so we started so

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,740
what we did was we partnered with the

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,530
cloud team that had a service that was

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,300
recently under development so after we

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,340
do routine production rating as we do

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,110
this we like to come in and sit down

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,240
with those right when they're building

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,010
out their applications we do an

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,600
architectural review and then we'll make

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,420
suggestions about you know which

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,340
database to use which deployment system

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,500
against that kind of thing and that was

00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,970
our opportunity sitting down partnering

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,709
with the cloud team that was developing

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,910
a new service their minority that

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,519
service ok so that's that's a good best

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,980
practice yeah start start simply and

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,110
show some success sounds like you did

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:18,600
and then what did it take to actually

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:20,790
build enough of a cultural agreement I

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,610
guess within the company to onboard

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,870
more apps so their liability team at

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:32,880
pure we're all about SLS and SLA s if

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:35,670
you're meeting your SLO then we really

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,860
don't care what you do with your service

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,049
with your app but the second may be star

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,940
violating your SLO and you start

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,730
violating your error budget that's where

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,010
we go in with our stick and say hey you

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,300
can't push through production until you

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,580
fix your buggy crappy service

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,730
and one how do we fix your buggy crappy

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,450
service well immutable the pointless in

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:02,360
spinnaker is a good first part sure dish

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,760
monitoring and telemetry and all the

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,800
kind of other operational environmental

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,650
stuff that goes along with improving

00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,160
your your service but really the key to

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,290
it is getting teams on the spinnaker so

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,090
we can monitor their pipeline and see

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,760
what teams are doing they may work make

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,590
recommendations as to what they need to

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,180
okay so I'm gonna play this back to you

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,680
so basically you have the paver road or

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,820
the golden path over here with spinnaker

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,470
yep and you're saying to these

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,120
application teams up I'm not gonna bug

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,370
you I'm not gonna make you get onto this

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,810
thing but if it starts becoming a

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,000
problem and you start violating area

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,080
budgets yeah then it's gonna be time for

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,210
you to move this over and you're just

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,160
kind of like waiting and allowing those

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,810
apps to move over whenever they have

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,110
problems which they inevitably do what

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,870
they never would and so how long do you

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,990
think it'll take for you to get whatever

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,390
the metric is most most services all

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,680
courses so we're roughly 18 months into

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:59,570
this journey I would say that we have 60

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,440
to 70 percent of our apps or spinnaker

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,940
yes yeah and we have our mission almost

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,890
all of our mission-critical apps running

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,020
on spinnaker now it's kind of going

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,900
through our legacy environments and just

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,790
cleaning them up so so let's talk a bit

00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,730
about what the benefits are they using

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,890
spinnaker beyond just the safety the

00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,810
reliability of the mutability what what

00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,730
other things about spinnaker are

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,190
valuable to you whether it's to you and

00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:28,280
your order to the to the organization at

00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:32,990
large well so the next step along our

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,900
journey is to start introducing security

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,790
scans and spinnaker so we're looking at

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,290
various applications that we install in

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,000
our sphere of the pipeline to do this

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,980
yeah the other thing is governance

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,570
that's gonna be a big push for us and

00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,730
that's where I see the value of

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,380
spinnaker as well Capital One they have

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,630
a great talk this morning about

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,180
powder using spin

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,920
here for governance as they forsook to

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,220
the Pyke's which is what we're working

00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,330
on it here okay so I see that so what's

00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,250
the Kyle teams

00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,980
what's our cloud developers embrace

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,080
spinnaker getting them migrating our

00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,600
apps onto spinnaker now it's relatively

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,220
easy is just a Slumdog yeah sure we need

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,010
to do some work up here around the body

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,720
templates and you know sre certified

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,520
templates that kind of thing to make it

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,290
a little bit easier for them to use

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,270
spinnaker right and point click click

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,410
click point yeah so we need to do that

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,410
but really security and governance those

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:29,200
who have expectations

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:31,000
is there anything as as this project

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,410
evolves is there anything any direction

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,300
that you'd like to see it take whether

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,680
its features and functionality that you

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,240
wish that it had you just talked about a

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,700
couple of things which there's

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,650
opportunities to to build those into

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,960
productize doors but let's just think

00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,660
forward three or five years what's kind

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,750
of your Nirvana State for sure well I

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,110
mean in the short term I think exposing

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,960
spinnaker api's would be great we have a

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,600
lot of you knows 5050 all right there's

00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,860
some developers that don't mind you I

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,700
love bees and there's some developers

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,930
like I just want to do everything

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,180
command line I just want to you know

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,480
type is called API ten we've actually

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,930
developed internal tools that pure that

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,390
called the spinnaker API so we can do

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,850
auditing inventory and that's how it's

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,170
called shaman we hope you can carry with

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,150
it to the open source community store

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:23,010
that's fantastic yeah this is pretty

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:26,110
pretty cool tool that we have so more

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,930
programmatic access to spinnaker and

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:32,620
then obviously the three to five year

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,420
navona path is seamless kubernetes

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,820
integration because we're on the

00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,250
kubernetes attorney as well right now

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,650
you know we're working with deploying

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,750
spinnaker halyard and so when you start

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,520
pulling an application to Cooper native

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,719
clusters are current up invitations a

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,129
little bit clunky

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:50,049
so we're hoping to reach out to the

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:51,729
community here thank you for having this

00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:53,379
character simmer for some help with that

00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,729
to see what other to bet what other

00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,769
companies are doing whatever developers

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:58,019
are doing so yeah that's that's probably

00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:00,009
sweet spot for us yeah I'd say

00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:04,419
kubernetes is just like a topic

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:06,249
everywhere it does expand upon that we

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,959
want to be able to do multi clouds and

00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:11,259
we also want to be able to pour our apps
