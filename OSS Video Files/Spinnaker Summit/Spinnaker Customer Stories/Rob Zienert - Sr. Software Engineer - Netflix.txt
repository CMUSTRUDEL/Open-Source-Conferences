00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,430
your full name and what you do

00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:13,540
yeah I'm a I'm Rob Cena I work at

00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:16,090
Netflix on the spinnaker team

00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,640
my main thing is working on the

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:23,020
performance and reliability of spinnaker

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,640
at Netflix so by proxy for so if

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,890
somebody isn't super familiar with

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,810
spinnaker they just heard about it why

00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,300
should they get more involved what are

00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:35,110
the benefits from your perspective yeah

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,510
so if you're just using something like

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,000
AWS or kubernetes there's a lot of

00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,000
things that you need to keep top of mind

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,720
that to be able to release software

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,159
safely and I think for for me my

00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,989
favorite feature of spinnaker is kind of

00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:56,559
abstracts away all the nitty-gritty

00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:59,320
things and gives you best practice

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,309
delivery how to get your software out

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,770
