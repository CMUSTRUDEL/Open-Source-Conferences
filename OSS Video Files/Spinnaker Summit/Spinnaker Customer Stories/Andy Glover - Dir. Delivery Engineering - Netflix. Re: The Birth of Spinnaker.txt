hey it's rodeo CEO Barberie I'm here

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,059
with Andy good introduce yourself sir

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,889
I'm Andy I run delivery engineering for

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,579
Netflix we're the team that owns and

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:18,090
operates vinegar okay so this whole

00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:20,940
spinnaker ecosystem with its conference

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,950
and growth let's rewind the clock back a

00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,350
couple of years and talk about how all

00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,280
this started since since it originated

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,440
in your team yeah yes so Netflix

00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,490
previously had a open source platform

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,839
called Asgard and so I was hired to

00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,679
[Music]

00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:39,510
essentially manage the team behind

00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,999
Asgard it was called cloud interface

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,609
tools and when I got to Netflix it was

00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:48,989
quickly figured out that they that

00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:51,379
Asgard had some shortcomings it didn't

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,269
do continuous delivery it was a manual

00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:55,760
tool for you know it could do really

00:00:54,269 --> 00:01:00,359
powerful things but it was essentially a

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,309
glorified AWS console and there were

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,809
actually two other systems that people

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,759
were using for continuous delivery they

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,920
had the notion of pipelines like do this

00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,500
then this then this and then in fact

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,659
both systems called Asgard API so then

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,430
like deploy in HD and so it was a parent

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,380
we you know probably should create a

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,039
centralized continuous delivery platform

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,289
so luckily one of the other systems I

00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,659
ended up owning and we shut it down and

00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:29,369
then I went to the other team and

00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:33,479
essentially pitched that hey look let us

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,979
build a new system and we'll we'll

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,710
leverage all the lessons learned from

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,060
you and some other systems and we'll

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,979
manage it rather than you because this

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,359
other team was doing edge they were they

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,030
were out there they were they are

00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,039
primarily responsible for the edge API

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,420
in Netflix in fact Ludo from edge is

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:54,539
speaking right now and so we set out to

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,090
create essentially the next version of

00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:58,009
asgard and then we ended up

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,350
it's vinegar so one of the things about

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,640
Asgard that we found for companies that

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,479
are still running it they have you know

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,579
one one one fortune 50 company had seven

00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,190
Forbes versions of Asgard rock inside

00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:12,819
their their own company but what what's

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,349
some of the philosophy behind spinnaker

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,629
antennae versus working yeah and in fact

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:21,709
you mentioned something key is this is

00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:23,840
forking so one of the lessons learned

00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,170
from Asgard is that the open source

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,989
community forked it in some cases you

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,340
know dozen times and those Forks did

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:34,120
really interesting things so there was a

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,269
fork for SoftLayer there was a fork for

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,360
OpenStack and there was a fork for

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:43,010
docker and at the time Netflix was

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,360
highly active in figuring out like what

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,519
do we do with docker what the story of

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,260
dr. and the problem of all these Forks

00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,060
is they were divergent from our version

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,989
you know and so the case in point this

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,310
enterprise you're talking about had

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,590
seven different Forks

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,690
those are seven trees of innovation that

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,129
you know would be great if they all came

00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,299
back to the main trunk but usually they

00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,280
just go off and do their own thing and

00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:02,720
so one of the things with spinnaker is

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,850
we wanted to create a platform where

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,040
people can extend it and innovate on it

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,910
but not have to fork it and so that's

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,750
that is if anything I think the real

00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,970
maybe one of the reasons why we're all

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,829
here today is that rather than you all

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,030
creating a fork and them creating a fork

00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,910
and then creating a fork and then we

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,620
also go off or do our things we do it on

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,150
one single platform when we get to learn

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,489
from each other and leverage each

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,190
other's innovations yeah so we made

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,540
spinnaker not only you know the inputs

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,730
to be pluggable because we were looking

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,609
at docker and we have VMs

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,500
but we also now do JavaScript

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:38,720
applications we do libraries firmware

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,819
you know ISOs and then we wanted the

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,430
output you know whatever the deployment

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:44,480
target to be pluggable so we got AWS

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,780
Jesus

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,200
you name it you know and then also the

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,150
ideas of pipelines in that we wanted

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,879
people so at Netflix there's a series of

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,989
centralized teams we're just one team

00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,090
but there are other teams that have

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,709
really interesting tooling at the time

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,660
there was another team that owned

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,130
automated canary analysis so we wanted

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,800
people to be able to plug these things

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,390
into a pipeline so that people could

00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,459
affect you know delivery because

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,410
previous to spinnaker if you wanted to

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,720
use a CA or automated canary analysis

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,850
you had to plug it in yourself into your

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,310
like string of Jenkins jobs or whatever

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,410
it was so you wrote the glue he wrote

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,210
the glue and she wrote the glue but by

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,310
creating a single centralized platform

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,660
then you have this idea of a paved road

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,910
so that's we call it that's what it's

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,800
like here's this superhighway of getting

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,630
from you know your machine into an

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,370
environment and you can take advantage

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,720
of all these things like a CA but more

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,760
importantly some of the business you

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,340
know let's say continuity things like

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,340
auditing compliance Sox PCI all that

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,229
stuff is all plugged in security into

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,570
spinnaker so that it makes it easy for

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,130
you to again take assets and put them in

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,620
front of you know customers yeah that's

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,210
amazing so I'd also like to dig in a

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,330
little bit into the the culture of

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,190
adoption at Netflix of of this platform

00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,150
we talked to cloud architects all the

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,000
time maybe there's somebody watching

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,250
this that is decided okay spinnaker is

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,350
is the platform that I want to use how

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,419
am I actually going to onboard all these

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,610
applications and teams on onto this

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,919
platform and so it Netflix there's no

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,229
mandate and and maybe talk a little bit

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,330
about how it is that the the edge team

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:21,139
at Netflix is now using spinnaker for

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,580
for example so I think it's uh it's

00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,830
probably a number of reasons in there

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,130
and then the first one maybe is you know

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,440
a cop-out or Netflix has a little easier

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,849
in that I strongly believe that the

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,830
value of continuous delivery is is

00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:37,310
moving fast you know the pace of

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,289
innovation right and the Netflix culture

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,150
is very much bought into that every team

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,970
at Netflix owns their own destiny so

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,070
edge there there is no release team or

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,080
ops team for production like edge owns

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,330
the edge

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,949
you know we I said it own and operate

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,509
spinnaker in that like if spinnaker has

00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,310
a bug we fixed at its pinnacle goes down

00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:55,960
in Punk'd production we fix it every

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,560
team in Netflix is like that and so

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:04,000
every team is incentivized to move fast

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,580
in a safe manner right and so selling

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,349
spinnaker or the idea of here's a

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,719
pipeline that ensures you can get your

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:12,370
stuff from here to there and it has all

00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:13,449
these checks it's not it's not really a

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,680
hard sell and there's actually quite

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,750
easy

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,069
case in point because other teams at

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,560
Netflix were already building continuous

00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:23,199
delivery platforms I think convincing

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,990
edge to get on they did have their own

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,270
system was you know we had to work with

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,969
edge and meet their use cases so because

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,150
there is no mandate at Netflix just like

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:36,310
you all we very much see ourselves as a

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,629
startup and we have customers there are

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,909
other engineers at Netflix and we have

00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,590
to listen to what they want understand

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:43,930
their use cases and their domains and

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,550
then provide them a solution to make

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,229
their job easier if we don't they'll go

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,330
elsewhere yeah there are you know they

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:51,129
can use Jenkins they can use you know

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,210
some other you know produced delivery

00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,529
platform yeah

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,000
and so I think that's something that

00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:59,889
enabled us to get edge onboard as we sat

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,750
down with them we in fact we developed

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,719
trust in the partnership and

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,029
understanding their domain you know

00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:08,589
learning their lessons and in fact we

00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,969
were what was awesome is that

00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:12,430
partnership built to the standpoint of

00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:14,560
two developers from edge worked on

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,860
spinnaker so worked on our team for a

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,719
couple quarters implementing their

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,339
specific features from case in point the

00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:24,129
first feature they implemented was was

00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:28,440
Canaries like integrating Canaries into

00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:31,120
spinnaker and the beauty was once Edge

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,849
got the features they felt were the

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,710
minimum you know viable products for

00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:37,270
them to use spinnaker they started using

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,099
it with battle-hardened it you know we

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:42,129
fixed the bugs made sure things worked

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:44,740
and then edge went out and said raising

00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,990
spinnaker this thing is rock-solid it

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,360
does everything we need and that was

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,529
like the dominoes fell and then all you

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,639
know there were other teams using

00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:52,930
spinnaker at the time but there were

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,430
teams in the you know in the sidelines

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,490
waiting to see like I don't want to be a

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,650
first mover here I want

00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,880
to find all the bugs but once edge got

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,259
up there and said hey we're doing these

00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,699
amazing things with spinnaker it was

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,440
like I'll never forget there was a

00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,389
director at Netflix he came to me he

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,430
goes that was really awesome and I

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,259
thought he was kidding I was like yeah

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,819
like where's the joke you know where's

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,430
the hammer gonna fall he was like

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,810
alright we're in and it was like you

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,530
know the light bulb went off it was okay

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,120
that's great

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,500
and so and then it from there it was

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,789
just a matter of working with it you

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,680
know all these other teams it was like a

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,000
line yeah you know we want to use

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
spinnaker but we need this thing all

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,190
right let's figure it out we'll

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,479
prioritize and we'll get that thing for

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,520
them and that thing for them and that

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,289
thing for them but and that's how we

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,000
still work today is you know we work

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,800
closely with our end users and

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,110
understanding what they need to again

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,789
affect safe reliable to deliver yeah you

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,740
know one thing that we see is a lot of

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,149
times these central central automation

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,800
teams they don't really think of the

00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,600
application teams as their as their

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
customers and they don't interview them

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,910
they don't understand what the pain is

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,500
and their building is tolling that the

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,459
application teams don't really want and

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,200
so the application teams go off the

00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,820
reservation and do their own thing so I

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
mean it sounds like you've just had this

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,779
very customer centric attitude within

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,000
Netflix and you've you've even been

00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,649
embedding those teams inside yours so

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,300
that we can make sure that what they

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,680
need is what's being built yeah I think

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,630
that's a great learning and best

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,390
practice if you're looking to bring a

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,589
possum like this into your or

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,170
organization let's also look to it

00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,420
towards the the future so how do you see

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,880
this project evolving and what are some

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,200
of your hopes if maybe somebody who's

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,270
thinking about getting involved it is

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,520
looking at this kind of intimidating

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,920
group 5,000 people and all seem to know

00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,260
each other how can someone get started

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,510
and what kinds of things might they work

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,050
on that would add a lot of value so I

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,940
definitely can empathize with the

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,310
potential kind of barrier entry to this

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,500
ecosystem it is it has grown

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:43,459
tremendously it's as I said this morning

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,520
five thousand four hundred sixty two

00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,960
channels and it is a pretty tight you

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,850
know

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,150
group we all pretty much know each other

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,380
you know saying hi to people and that's

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:59,290
scaled I think for the first few years

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,510
it dawned on both me and Steven Kim from

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,870
Google probably about a year ago that

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,400
this thing was bigger than that any you

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,340
know if one person or two people could

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,570
manage it wasn't scaling where all of a

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,190
sudden I would you know I would go to a

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,870
conference and talk about spinnaker and

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,060
there would be someone who come up to me

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,650
that I didn't know but that was you know

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,940
already using spinnaker and like knew it

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,160
you know better than I did type thing it

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,420
was like wow how did you know how did I

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,040
not know that you were you know this

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,370
company was using sped of hurt and

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,770
Steven was having the same experience so

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,560
the idea with establishing a governance

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:37,870
policy is to level the playing field and

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:40,270
clarify if Joe or Sally whoever it is

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,310
working at a small company who may have

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,720
been intimidated by the fact of oh it's

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,070
Netflix and Google I could never I mean

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,900
it cuz I used to be at small companies

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:51,730
I've always wanted I always wanted to be

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,440
at a table and Google and be like hey

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,970
let's have a conversation

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,830
I've never had the chance to tell that

00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,390
you know is that Netflix but so I could

00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,100
empathize with this like how do you ever

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,710
get involved in it on a project where

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,170
these two you know big companies are and

00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,340
the truth is is that we're all you know

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,250
everyone puts their you know pants on

00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,320
one leg at a time you know but the

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,770
governance policy clearly lays out there

00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,860
are there basically active community

00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:20,490
members is anybody you could file PRS

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,690
are consuming up years you file issues

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,030
answer questions in the slack Channel

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,370
certainly you can ask them as well you

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,110
can file with those issues you could you

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,330
can start ideas you could do that on the

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,010
forum and then there's you can move into

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,190
a reviewer and actually anyone can be a

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,960
reviewer look at a PR and and provide

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,110
some commentary hey this is awesome or

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,420
hey if you think of it this way I mean

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:48,930
there's a different way you can you know

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:52,200
the PR and then from a reviewer then you

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,540
can become an approver and how we

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,100
establish so those are the like the

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,630
three you know the tracks that people

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,130
can and this is anybody we set up a a

00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,390
technical Oversight Committee and then a

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,130
steering committee and the technical

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,670
Oversight Committee is ultimately the

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:12,150
committee that is approving people from

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:15,870
going from approvers to choose me from

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:18,920
reviewers to approvers and to get

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:22,890
noticed is you know just make yourself

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,590
there be active answer questions a great

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:28,560
story I think is even on you know

00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,660
unarmored ethan he's starting answering

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,160
questions early on all about kubernetes

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,530
and everything they were doing back in

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,500
his former company and then he started

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,480
submitting PRS and was reviewing other

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,830
people's PRS and he just it was like it

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,880
was clear here's a you know here's

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,620
somebody that's doing some million

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,250
things let's get him into the ecosystem

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,500
and at the time of course it was kind of

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,120
unclear how he you know like well who

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,310
knew him and how did he get nominate now

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,260
it's more established we've made it very

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,830
clear if you think you should be an

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:01,380
approver basically paying these people

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:02,910
and say hey look here's my here's my

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,010
body of work or what do you think of

00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,350
this and they'll have a meeting though

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,960
and and they will it's all open and they

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,280
will either say hey this is great or

00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,560
hopefully they will say this is great by

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,260
the way we want more approvers firmly

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,030
believe the more people committing code

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,670
and innovating and spinnaker we all win

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,010
and so again I think I've said this

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,870
probably now like you know I'm kickin

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,940
the dead horse but we're trying to even

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,990
the playing field so it's not like oh I

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,790
know a friend of a friend of you knew

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,960
Andy and now I've got commit privileges

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:35,500
it's it's anyone anyone here can become

00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,560
we've laid it out you just participate

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,060

documentation spinner cryo is

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,970
essentially hosted on github there's a

00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,589
repository you can add code labs you can

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,300
correct grammar I mean there's there's

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,589
no shortage of things you can do for

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,510

that it is open to anyone and you don't

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,220
have to be from Netflix or Google you

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,649

ecosystem yeah I mean today we have 40

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,680
approvers at write right now which I

00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,600
don't think people necessarily recognize

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,459
that there were that many so we hope to

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,860
have I don't want to set a number but

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,209
like I have every expectation but when

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,350
we have this conversation next year that

00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:00,360
number will be much higher yeah all

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,360
right all right thank you sir thank you
