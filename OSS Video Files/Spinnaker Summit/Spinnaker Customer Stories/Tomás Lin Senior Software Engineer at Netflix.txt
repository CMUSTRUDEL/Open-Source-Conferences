hello I'm journey with our Marines my

00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,270
co-founder eyes because gone yet

00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:10,269
we're here with a very special guest

00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:12,789
Tomas so first of all state your name

00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:15,519
and your involvement with Roger

00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:18,099
sure my name is Tomas Lynn I work at

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,820
Netflix I've been with the project since

00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,550
the very beginning

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,439
since before he had a day so I've been

00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,970
working with the special project since

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,410
he was four or five people in the room

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,789
okay so basically this video is for

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,440
people that may not be as familiar with

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:36,019
spinnaker just hearing about

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,809
would you explain this project and why

00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:39,949
somebody should get more involved what's

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:43,460
kind of the benefit from your

00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:45,620
perspective trendy lover always

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,789
describes winter grass smear occurs

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,549
something that makes her deployment

00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,140
bored and I think pour out that really

00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,629
makes sense because Annette we do that

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,030
for thousands of micro-services every

00:00:53,629 --> 00:01:00,260
day down sometimes and we needed a

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:02,930
system that was reliable and safe and I

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,519
think that if you care about having a

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,320
project that if you care about your

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,909
deployment you care about making your

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,220
deployments kind of self-service and

00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,460
simple to use and spinnaker is something

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,460
that you

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,320
No Oh actually what are you working on

00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,120
now for spinning earth ah

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,580
most recently I'm working on the

00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,400
tightest cloud provider so Titus is the

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,960
container platform and Netflix and we've

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,740
been working really hard to make that a

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,060
first-class citizen in the same way that

00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,430
Amazon Web Services and EMS are being

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,270
used today at Netflix so that's being

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,270
moved to my father

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,760
in a boring way like Netflix does

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,690
thousands of times per day spinnaker is

00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,690
something usually good

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,000
