00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,510
with a very special guest good introduce

00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,759
yourself

00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,809
hey I'm Jake I reckon I work on

00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,809
spinnaker okay so

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,529
okay so I'm the GC providers or

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,390
maintainer and also I work a little bit

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,300
in like this or to build a release

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,400
process - pipeline how long

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,690
since I joined his little boy Jason

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,730
Valley - nine years ago

00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,290
she described something new may not be

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,360
as familiar with it we're starting to

00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,220
hear about it why why should they

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,149
thinking

00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,989
[Music]

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:48,219
I'm wholistically is just like you know

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:48,219
well diagnostic

00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,370
you don't really want to dig into the

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,570
very deep details of the cloud provider

00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,340
it's been the graph before it's a nice

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,220
layer on top of all the cloud providers

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,180
that supports and lets you sort of ship

00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,180
as fast as you can

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,890
so we've got a lot more community

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,900
involvement there's been a kind of bond

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,220
fighters you sort of add in different

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,260
community members like contributing

00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,850
features it's been really

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,800
I've been very surprised like coming

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,310
here they seeing how many people have

00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,609
showed up

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:31,179
like a real exciting that's insanity

00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,179
Center

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,180
yeah it makes it Nick and like they're

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,310
saying like clarifying what's what's

00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,080
been happening so that's very clear how

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,160
people can start getting involved less

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,160
of like a sort of iron

00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,560
they contribute if someone's watching

00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,220
this video and wants to get actively

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,390
[Applause]

00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,390
what are some of the things

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,009
so one of them

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,229
I mean there's a whole bunch of

00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:10,670
everything that's under fire open

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,630
questions like

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,730
how do we started

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,080
makes Spinnaker's scale an organization

00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,240
is like there's a lot of things where

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,990
you can improve on that so there's

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,420
something like like we need

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:27,180
started with the CLI so adding in pages

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:30,660
there like feedbacks on in five

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,660
the KPI is

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,140
yeah

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,700
if somebody wants to get involved what's

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,560
the best way so I think starting from

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,210
the slack channels to joining slack

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,100
channel in my discourse and sort of

00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,460
asking a bunch of questions there a way

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,460
to get was

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,740
using operational expenditure

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,740
find employees better

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,570
join dots vinegar gallo

00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,180
joining together

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,090
