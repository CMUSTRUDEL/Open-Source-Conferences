Title: Joel Vasallo @ Spinnaker.Live: Sailing with Spinnaker - OnDemand Delivery at Redbox
Publication date: 2020-06-20
Playlist: Spinnaker.Live 2020
Description: 
	In the past year, Redbox's engineering team was tasked with building a Multi-Region On Demand platform from the ground up. From backend to frontend, from source to delivery, there were a lot of things in motion. Instead of building an in-house delivery platform, we chose to use the popular continuous delivery platform: Spinnaker! Using Spinnaker, Redbox's delivery engineers were able to focus on solving the delivery challenges specific to their technology stack.

In this session, we will recap and share how Redbox built on the concepts of paved road delivery to empower their developers to rapidly deliver software safely and securely to multiple regions. In addition, we will share how we used Spinnaker to build our On Demand platform at Redbox; from 10s to 1000s of deployments a month. Finally, we will share some strategies and lessons learned along the way when building/extending Spinnaker for both applications and Istio.
