Title: Amy Smidutz @ Spinnaker.Live: Infrastructure Experimentation Using Spinnaker
Publication date: 2020-06-18
Playlist: Spinnaker.Live 2020
Description: 
	At Netflix, we leverage AB testing and experimentation to gain confidence that our apps are behaving as designed. In this presentation, I give a high-level overview of how Spinnaker can be used to enable infrastructure experimentation. I will demonstrate how we test in production, run Chaos experiments, and how we leverage automated canary analysis. The goal is that the audience walks away inspired to start using Spinnaker to conduct, manage, and monitor controlled experiments within their infrastructure.
