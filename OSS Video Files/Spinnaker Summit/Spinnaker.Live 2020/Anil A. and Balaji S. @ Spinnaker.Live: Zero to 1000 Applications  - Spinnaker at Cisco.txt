all right welcome to

00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,849
1,000 applications success story from

00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,369
Cisco

00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:20,329
my name is Balaji Siva and I hope you're

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:23,060
enjoying the spinnaker live or already

00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:26,630
at the keynote and thank you earning

00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,969
your session I'm part of ops MX team

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,119
I run product adoption x and we provide

00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:33,860
a spinnaker services to customers

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,149
enterprises and I have with me the

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:41,420
pleasure of introducing Anil he is

00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:44,420
coming from Cisco he's an enterprise IT

00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,800
architect and he is you're going to

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:51,320
today talk about the Cisco success

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,860
journeying of Cisco of spinnaker from

00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,960
from all the way from initial evaluation

00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,180
to non-production to thousands of

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:06,189
applications so I'm pretty excited about

00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:09,950
this talk and I know hey thanks Balaji

00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:13,280
so I serve as the IT architect at the

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,729
Cisco Systems I'm leading 10 years

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,840
delivery and application security space

00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:23,090
mainly the checkouts space excellent

00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,830
thank you we know each other for the

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,760
last three years I think he was in San

00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:32,270
Jose and then he moved to RDP which is a

00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,520
not Carolina I did actually reverse you

00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,799
know I was an RTP and I moved not San

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,909
Jose California and I can tell you

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,430
you're probably do the right thing

00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,720
because housing prices and all those

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,880
things that they make sense to be an

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,210
article for sure

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,369
so thank you I think we both of us have

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,619
been working this vinegar journey with

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:54,710
Cisco to you guys for a while and I

00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:56,840
thought the story or in the whole

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,060
process you went through at Cisco was

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,890
really interesting and a lot of the

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,030
people of the community while they are

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,670
trying to decide on spinnaker benefit

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,289
from your positioning and your thought

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,819
process in this in this all exit

00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:15,890
experience so I wanna definitely have

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,500
the have you talked about it so before

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,010
we get started if you have any questions

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,480
feel free to ask in the Q&A panel one of

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,280
us

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,430
would be happy to answer their questions

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,640
if not we will have you reach out to you

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:34,690
after the session so let's get started

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,700
No so we scroll I think you know the

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,880
interesting thing I three things I sort

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,290
of at a high level wanna get across from

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,420
at the end of the session for the

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,660
audience is that you guys are rare you

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,120
know or large and thousands of thousands

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,220
of dollars and that our usings connector

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,590
right now and honestly plants a lot more

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,750
obvious losing thousands of applications

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,790
but also you're looking at not only the

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,200
traditional container based applications

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,370
you're looking at other kinds of

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,019
workloads and also you have as a large

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,660
enterprise you have a lot of compliance

00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:10,330
and regulation requirements that's also

00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,459
something you're trying to bring in to

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,380
the spinnaker so that that's something

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,470
we will talk more about it as you go

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,209
along let's get at the beginning you're

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,890
part of the enterprise IT team and you

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,300
you looked at I guess you are you're

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,459
trying to deploy applications to can

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,310
open ship based deployments so budget

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,590
based in environments and what was the

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,420
challenge that you faced and what were

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,250
the why are you looking at the alternate

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,560
options such as vinegar yeah so um I

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,470
think you and I know that the journey

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,440
that we had in terms of spinnaker so we

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:50,829
yes we were initially part of the Cisco

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,690
Enterprise PI T and B Verdi teams who

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,320
are enabling continuous delivery

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,120
solutions to the all of the Cisco IT and

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,760
we were using our own internal call

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,280
internal cloud which is nothing but the

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,959
gran had open which is swing on the

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,110
OpenStack and that's where we used to

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,560
allow our enable our developers to do

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,690
the department's yeah I think we used to

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,860
provide them the Achilles will

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,289
continuous integration continuous

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,030
deployment and some other spaces as well

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:23,169
in terms of the compliance governance

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:27,400
and other things dollar and and some of

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:29,500
the so the specific challenges that you

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,310
faced right I mean I think you are

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,419
looking at options and and some of the

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,719
challenges you face

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:42,069
why did you consider spinnaker as a

00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:46,520
solution that you you were considered

00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:50,000
from the years back there was a huge

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:53,210
price of SAS platforms and public clouds

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,240
is a new workload at runtime in Cisco

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,629
that kind that pushed us to think of a

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,000
new solution and also we we want you to

00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:04,699
look at some of the solutions which can

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,500
help the developers deploy to multi

00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:08,810
cloud and that's where we saw the

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,759
spinnaker coming in and also we were

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,129
looking for some solution which can be

00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,900
hosted cloud native environment because

00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:17,990
we were looking at the open ship that is

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,969
our internal cloud thus we started

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,610
exploring the spinnaker and its ability

00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:26,120
to provide multi core was the solution

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:29,270
that really made us think of a new

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,150
solution that can help us and what are

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:36,349
some other criterias so as you started

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,000
pure spinnaker and Chandra determine if

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,219
it's the right product for your

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,099
production use case what are some other

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:45,050
specific criteria that you looked at to

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:50,979
evaluate before you choose when I heard

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:53,060
I think criterias pad was a multi cloud

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:56,449
definitely that was the number one on

00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:00,620
our plate but we also wanted to look at

00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:03,020
how flexible the solution is is an API

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,139
driven so that we wanted to integrate

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,750
with our own systems like the compliance

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:11,360
the gown and the policy engine we wanted

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,750
to we also have analytics so in order to

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,050
make sure the solution not only is

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:21,460
flexible but also can be integrated

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:25,969
integrated in our systems and we also

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:29,419
good from for this was a groupie from

00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:32,000
ops max team really does do some of the

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,039
evaluation in terms of making sure we

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,349
have a single pipeline which can deploy

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,589
quality cloud as well I think these were

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:43,449
the criterias and some of P help that go

00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:45,949
from OC's onyx was much appreciated

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:48,630
that's where I think the I guess one of

00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:51,270
the year maybe that we

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,530
dr. bird was it armed this being an open

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,450
source

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,700
I think there you know there is

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,350
definitely one is obviously there cost

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,080
advantage you have with an open source

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,020
even if you are using external support

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,850
for example but you in you like that

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,110
it's an open source what did you talk

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:12,750
about that Alberto yes yes the open

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,460
source was be an is one of the cry clear

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,860
because we wanted to scale the

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,490
enterprise level and that open source

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,570
was definitely was one of the criterias

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,450
that we were looking for

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,320
I mean to me I think the the benefit I

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,730
think you can we can all agree upon is

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,960
contributions and the participation from

00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:35,970
everybody right I think I think we love

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,800
working on the in the open source

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,080
community you have in this particular

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,330
location spinnaker here obviously the

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,310
Netflix and the googles as well as

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,890
actually customers other customers like

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,600
yourself and and Target and Cerner and

00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,360
other people actually contributing code

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,640
back for the community and they're

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,260
driving the feature requirements I think

00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:00,990
that's something we see useful for we're

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:05,160
like you and oh yeah yeah I think I

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,470
think that will be one of the boosting

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,710
point I would see not a tightly but I

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:14,160
think that was the the volume of

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:16,110
community and the how active it was is

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,260
specifically on the kubernetes side I

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:22,460
think that was really a criteria for us

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,560
which bumped up to look at this solution

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,290
got it so now let's say you you you have

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,260
you had a reasons to move and then you

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,550
had evaluated spinnaker now you know

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,590
you're twisting let me go to production

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:39,840
so do you go with a single large I mean

00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,729
how did you go about your production

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,820
architecture let's this a right is it a

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,970
single instance or multiple instances or

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,690
and what are some other things you you

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:54,150
kind of dealt with yeah we've started

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,890
with the I think everybody stands with

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,080
the single instance that's that's the

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,960
go-to thing started with the single

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,960
direction into enterprise instance which

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,240
the whole of Cisco I geek but very soon

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,210
we came across new challenges which was

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,700
just keeping in performance simply spend

00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,980
a lot of time in terms of testing

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,160
regression and making sure we had all

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,920
the tests evaluated and we also look at

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,410
the risk eggs or the date points so

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,840
basically we wanted to do a thorough

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,600
testing and B squeak to the production

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,140
right and that's finally we thought that

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,940
of reacting the whole infrastructure and

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,400
we included me implemented a multi

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,350
instance pick basically based on a

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,940
specific organization we started

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,300
spinning up multiple instances so that

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,550
we we could not only provide the

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,920
performance level but also the risk

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,870
level was you know because if there was

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,850
an instance in fact that happened it

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,650
would happen to only a specific group of

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,010
people not rather than the whole

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,680
enterprise so I think currently from

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:01,620
right about ten instances eight of them

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,030
in sort of the production kind of use

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,480
case and couple of them sort of a

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:09,930
staging kind of deployments yes yeah I

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,060
think yeah we have Spinnaker's running

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,330
in three regions we call them data

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,240
centers and we have eight production

00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:21,780
instances run in each data centers and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,540
they are a chain in terms of a queue

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,940
passing and we have another three

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,760
instances running for our own

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,800
development team and definitely where we

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,500
do all the configurations upgrades

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,750
patching we validate specific features

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,150
in our own environment so basically we

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,990
have more than almost like more than 20

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:46,110
22 plus instance was running in our

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,060
language okay that's that's that's many

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,360
anything as you look towards the future

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:54,230
you plan to add almost spinnaker

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,850
instance per group kind of a model that

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,610
yes I think that that's the model we

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,520
want to follow I think that brings down

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,910
as I told it brings down the risk unlock

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,260
got it and let's talk about upon

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,810
boarding and

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:13,350
how did you you know identify the first

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:17,160
set of applications that you would on

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:19,110
bore and and some of the things you have

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,590
to get to the first users on border and

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,970
also continue to add additional

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,040
applications so I would you talk about

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,470
your strategy I mean I guess more

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,210
importantly what should the what should

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,610
some large are engine like yourself that

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:37,020
would should they look about you know

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:39,570
looking upon boarding strategy yeah I

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,570
think we didn't do a bang approach

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:46,410
rather we picked up the table for

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:49,380
business applications we worked with

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:52,500
them we unloaded their applications on

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,440
to our environment and we went through

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,810
the challenges that Babli the experience

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,530
that wanted to have and that really

00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:04,260
created the whole be we whole experience

00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,870
for the developer and also once that was

00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,820
done we started having multiple wins

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,160
basically one of the biggest event that

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,930
we had was hack ID when we called the

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,380
whole of the Cisco developer community

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:19,670
to participate in our entire journey and

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:23,370
they they happen to work on all the

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,620
Spinnaker's the city pipeline so that's

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,880
where it attracted lost developers and

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,950
that's where we started onward and

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,790
that's where our journey of adoption

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:37,830
started yeah that's a great great way to

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,020
let the developers decide right what

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,750
platform they choose it won't still

00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,450
once you remove their fear of new

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,820
platform etc they get to do it in a you

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,970
know a demo set or a hacking session

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,400
they feel now ready to go to that

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:55,260
alright perfect so when you as you as

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,080
you've got all these all of these

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,760
developers on-boarded well you have to

00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,170
have to do I know you have lots of

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,760
developers you have like four thousand

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,300
five other developers and Enterprise IT

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,220
talking to you last time and how did you

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,620
you and thousands of applications so do

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,950
you have to set up self-service model

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,540
for these developers or all your team

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,910
was involved every time there is a need

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,590
to onboard an application and how do you

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,819
keep your sanity because there's a lot

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,850
of compliance and regularly

00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:26,339
that needs to happen as well yeah I

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,549
think we built a transactional web

00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:33,269
experience layer for IT developers about

00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:36,269
all the tools which provides a rich data

00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:37,589
driven in terms of the compliance in

00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:40,319
terms of the governance if there is a

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:41,879
Sox application it validates and it's

00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,919
kind of a la carte self-service

00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,769
provisioning for the CI CD pipeline so

00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:50,579
that's how we went about self servicing

00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:53,639
the developers got it and and what

00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,289
challenges from spinnaker scaling

00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:00,149
perspective as you obviously you scaled

00:13:55,289 --> 00:14:02,189
a lot of not of the users what are some

00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:06,059
of the scaling challenges we ran into an

00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:08,039
out reducer or come back yeah I think as

00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:11,009
I told you before the one of the biggest

00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,649
challenge was in terms of accounts the

00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:16,559
cloud cover accounts once we reached

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,899
more than 200 300 accounts that's where

00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,970
we started seeing some of the challenges

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,809
in terms of the performance and that's

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,579
where I think OB and all helped us

00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:28,679
specifically the company also pitched in

00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:31,979
and helped us in terms of optimizing the

00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:35,850
accounts and not only that we also would

00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:39,089
our accounts to a central repository get

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:42,239
repository and which has helped us

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,100
improve a lot of performance in terms of

00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:48,559
managing and maintaining this pinnacle

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:50,729
instance you know and so today you are

00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,509
thousands of thousands of applications

00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:56,909
is a thousand plus applications that way

00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:59,369
but that's right so we our main tool was

00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:01,859
when we started me wanted to hit a 700

00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:03,629
upon production but actually we went

00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:06,709
beyond that thousand plus production

00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:09,600
deployments thanks Allah so what are the

00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:11,970
success criteria or success metrics that

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,699
you are and so on I want to break it

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,519
down into what you that the tools team

00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:19,679
saw right as your metrics and then

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,379
obviously the developer the app team saw

00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:27,989
the metric and what is your your you

00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:30,449
know the IT leaders as a metric yeah I

00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:33,540
think one of the tricks was in terms of

00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:37,590
the deployment the adoption

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,290
in Crete people it helped my development

00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:44,400
team migrate to the cloud native as in

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:46,110
North Cisco is still lost in the legacy

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,080
old model which are migrating to cloud

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,090
that really helped them productivity

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,910
gain next one speed of deployment was

00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:56,190
and there were a lot of as I told you

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,960
there was a lot of times that happened

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,780
these were some of the productivity

00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,620
metrics that I can column and I think

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,870
you do I guess the one thing is the the

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,310
time to arm board a new application was

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,530
there a difference between sort of the

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,250
let's say the old model versus a new

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:16,260
model because now you're able to sort of

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,060
bring in some sort of the offline things

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,520
as part of the spinnaker automation

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:25,050
anything you saw that think ensure

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:27,540
getting each thing as a dump it used to

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,110
take a lot of time because of the

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,670
multiple tools that we had due to our

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,240
transactional debt service and the

00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:39,360
service we had improved a lot humongous

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,970
improvement in terms of the stacks

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,420
getting created that has Peter speed the

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,600
whole process of the development area

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,740
yeah

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,770
so as you look forward as you look

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,100
forward what are the some of the big

00:16:52,770 --> 00:17:00,780
things you're looking to do next year on

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,880
the spinnaker platform see one of the

00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,740
biggest thing that looking for is the

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,589
policy engine we are working on the

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,350
oppor policy basically we want to ensure

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,180
that all our pipeline deployments are

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,520
asking to production

00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:18,060
they all need the compliance down and as

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:21,570
well as the security aspect we have a

00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:24,030
beer we are big on that and also we are

00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:26,730
looking at a lot of others aspects like

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,680
the snowflake the Salesforce and the

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,770
service now we want to make sure that we

00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,380
do allow the developers to do that in

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:37,040
studios as well I think it's going to be

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,870
a big big thing for us yeah I think the

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,430
you know I go back to a couple of the

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,990
first vouchers on the pause integration

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,910
I know that they were working with you

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:49,780
and I'm trying to easily enable the

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:53,620
opah based open weather is a open policy

00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,929
agent that that integrated into the

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,850
spinnaker so you're able to define and

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:00,850
through regular expressions some of the

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,710
policies that you need it could be a Sox

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,840
compliance check or it could be some

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,929
other kind of check and that helps

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,179
people to bring in sort of the manual or

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:13,720
offline ad hoc processes that people

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:18,190
have as well as the spinnaker pipeline I

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,039
think that's something that I guess

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,630
large organizations like yourself who

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,539
would needed many of those because you

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,070
probably had a lot of a lot processes

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,539
and things like that also compliant

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,120
requirement that needs to be verified

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:33,700
even though you know you may have other

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,740
checks and balances that's something

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,960
we'll save a significant amount of time

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,299
at overall pipeline the actual elective

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,090
deployment I think we were talking a few

00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,159
days ago was like maybe you're saving

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:47,470
you know 3 X 4 X Phi X improvement from

00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,480
a natural that process but bringing in

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,400
the sort of the ad hoc processes and

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,179
make it as a one seamless delivery

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,000
system I would bring in a lot more

00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,850
savings from an efficiency yeah I mean

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,240
definitely I mean definitely on that

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,860
biology I think PE yeah that desert /

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,590
you should not be worried for all these

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,840
adult things and it's all or the

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,179
pipeline right all he needs to worry

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,309
about is company is developing is

00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:18,370
committing McCain deploying to the

00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:19,870
instance and all the college fossil

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,419
should be built in the system and

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,299
automated check it there I think heading

00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:28,150
tools and and the second point I think

00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:30,309
it's also interesting is sort of the you

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,049
know the non-traditional workforce I

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:34,179
guess you know for versus in occur

00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:35,860
typically associated with 2.0 kubernetes

00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:38,320
or ec2

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,960
so but you're actually trying to do for

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:47,350
snowflake and and del gloomy and other

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:49,720
kinds of workloads or are usually yes

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,490
that's the some that spinnaker can

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,159
deploy to the clouds I think every way

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,110
we see them but because of our own

00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,340
platforms because we have a hybrid

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,769
deployment so we can

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,440
we work with the community and the

00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,840
gobies of the Gobi from offs annex to

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,830
build a custom job which can not only

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,929
deploy to this last product but also a

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,539
lot of applications who are running on

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:18,059
our open track viens so that's that's

00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,399
language we did because we wanted to

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,740
provide that experience has seen some

00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:25,230
hydrating from their latest student

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,029
cloud they also have HP of deploying

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,009
into the legacy system that's a part of

00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:32,639
the stream pipeline

00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:34,980
so as we wind up the session well isn't

00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,009
so I want you to give us three takeaways

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,779
for the community what it could be a

00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:42,090
best practice it could be your

00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:44,600
suggestion so what are the three things

00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:49,129
you wanna want people to say you know

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:52,409
learning lessons or I think

00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:55,440
multi-instance that really increase our

00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:57,179
performance and it lowered the risk to a

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,129
smaller groups I think that's a big

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:04,860
takeaway for me and the custom jobs it

00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:09,240
that definitely helps us to do other

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:11,190
platforms as well that is a yeah I think

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,440
those are the two top things that I

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,240
would say and that really helped us and

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,129
that will definitely help the other

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,759
Enterprise organizations as well we're

00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:22,830
adopting sounds good one last question I

00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:26,700
guess what would you ask the community

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,049
to help you or help focus on for the

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,330
next year what would what would that

00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:35,909
make you that'll will be your suggestion

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:37,619
yeah I think one call-out is we happen

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:40,200
to do a lot of testing regression

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:41,879
testing automated testing when we are

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,470
bringing the instance to a production

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:46,350
Enterprise production right

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:49,919
adding build automation runs that

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:52,110
community can make that open-source that

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,509
will definitely help us because we'll be

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,519
build and modify the containers we can

00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:58,740
run those specific tests and make sure

00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,590
we meet all the criteria that the

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:04,499
community sirs or excells to do right

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:08,460
that will definitely help us the second

00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:10,679
one is the ability to integrate with the

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,059
plug-in framework so that we can make it

00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,700
seamless for the user experience right

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,429
for the seaters and reporting errors the

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,470
second thing that will really help us

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:23,649
community perspective very good thank

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,990
you and L so much I think hopefully the

00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:29,049
audience are able to get some takeaways

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,120
obviously they can reach out to you you

00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:32,440
know through to the you know through

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,759
whatever channels that's available

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,190
please feel free to ask you a and we

00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,139
need us to talk to us one on one happy

conclusive questions thanks you for a
