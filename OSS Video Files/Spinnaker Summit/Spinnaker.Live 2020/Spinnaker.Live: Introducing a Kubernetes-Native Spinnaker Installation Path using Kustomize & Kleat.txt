Description: 
	Maggie Neterval and Eric Zimanyi are excited to introduce a new Kubernetes-native Spinnaker configuration and installation experience using Kustomize and Kleat. We discuss our motivation for redesigning this workflow, including the history and drawbacks of the existing Halyard-based experience. We then demo a complete configuration and deployment workflow using Kleat-generated service config files and the new Spinnaker Kustomization base.
