Title: Adobe's Pranay Kumar and Nav Hothi @ Spinnaker.Live: How to Deliver Software with Spinnaker
Publication date: 2020-06-20
Playlist: Spinnaker.Live 2020
Description: 
	The Adobe Experience Platform team uses Spinnaker for deploying micro services to a multi cloud kubernetes environment at scale. In this talk, we go over how our Spinnaker pipelines are designed and structured, how to take advantage of the built in integrations Spinnaker offers, and our general experiences as well as what we have learnt over the past year and a half.

Our team's journey with Spinnaker began with the Spinnaker conference in 2018. With the knowledge we obtained at the conference, we introduced Spinnaker to our stack and evolved our CI/CD strategy over time to get to what it is today. During the year we were faced with many decisions on different paths to take and weâ€™ll go over where that has led us, and where we are heading. We also talk about a few of the built in integrations Spinnaker offers, such as Jenkins, Github, and Helm, that can enhance the developer experience and enable enhanced workflows."
