this is a panel discussion to talk

00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,030
through the working from home situation

00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,910
so thank you all for joining joining us

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,980
for the panel discussion on this shared

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,220
experience of working from home during

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,720
this unprecedented time I think it's

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,970
safe to say that none of us could have

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,489
imagined just about six months ago that

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,050
we'd be living through times like this

00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:28,579
from many including me and my family

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,059
this has been a challenging experience

00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:36,020
to stay positive stay sane and maybe

00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:38,150
sometimes even be productive for our

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,350
discussion today we're going to be

00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,700
focused on the sheltering a place

00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,640
experience that most of us have been

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,440
living through but I also think it's

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,120
vital that we don't lose sight of the

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,440
enormous civil-rights moment that is

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,720
taking place right now

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,900
well this panel will be discussing that

00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,790
in any detail I'd personally urge

00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,100
everyone to consider taking concrete

00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,079
action to make your voice heard and to

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,939
amplify the voices of those who need you

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:08,270
to act now so with that we'll do a quick

00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:13,250
round of introductions so I'd like to

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,229

better or improving things part of that

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,229
is our CIC D pipeline with spinnaker

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,090

and I've been working on spinnaker since

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,090
it started at Netflix and I've been

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,090
working remotely since 2016 had several

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,650
very different companies and currently

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,710

for spinnaker also excited to be here

00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,730
thanks clay so I guess we'll just go

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,320
ahead and jump into it so the the first

00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,410
the first question to the panel it's the

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,610
major challenge from pre-pandemic to

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:58,060
post pandemic

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,060
how has your working experience changed

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:06,420
and II well I think that the biggest

00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:09,060
maybe challenge that I think I face but

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,859
I know others a face is the lack of kind

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,349
of spontaneous or serendipitous

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,439
conversations with folks you see face to

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,879
face and so I know I struggled with that

00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,950
for a little while because I didn't

00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,019
recognize how important it was when I

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,730
would see someone in the hallway or when

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,609
we're grabbing coffee or like you know

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,459
even after work or during lunch and

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:32,400
those those you know quick two to

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,200
three-minute conversations were both you

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,659
know a good social experience but also

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,889
like there was critical kind of business

00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,060
importance than that and that we were

00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,769
talking about something we were all

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,980
working on or I was learning about

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:45,750
something new and so in this new world

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,090
where we're all remote everything's very

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,579
transactional and so I do feel a sense

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,549
of loss of information and so it just

00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:58,620
the the impetus is on me the onus is on

00:03:53,549 --> 00:04:00,419
me to be very deliberate about setting

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,669
up time to talk with various photons the

00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,199
company to rekindle that that social

00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,199
connection but also get that context

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,660
any other thoughts on the work

00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,620
experience and

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,420
so for me I was working at home on and

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,520
off before and my husband I used to work

00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,650
right next to each other that did not

00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,440
once were home when we're both on calls

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,360
that did not work I did kick my kid out

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,410
of his room so I could take over his

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,120
room and that really made me aware the

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,940
privilege I have of having all this

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,110
space it may be like especially with

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,000
everything that's going on how

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,610
privileged and fortunate I am to have a

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,130
job to have enough space to kick my kid

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,530
out so I can have an office and it's

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:51,100
it's really made me even more I think of

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,960
an advocate for people who don't have

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,170
those options and privileges don't have

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,420
a job don't have a space have toddlers

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,830
underfoot all that goods all that good

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,830
all that stuff

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,440
clay so um I've been working remotely

00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:13,960
for a while before everything changed

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,810
with a pandemic and before the

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,550
challenges seemed to be around like

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,819
work-life balance and time management

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,550
and taking control of the space that you

00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:28,330
want to work in and and finding social

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,949
outlets that kind of disappear um and I

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,470
kind of had that figured out after some

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:39,130
practice but post pandemics I I guess I

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,020
would I would people who are kind of

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,720
thrust into this now after the pandemic

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,759
it's a different experience like I've

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,500
got different challenges I've got home

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,900
schooling to deal with during the day a

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,060
lot of that tivities that we canceled

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:56,319
that we counted on for social

00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:00,610
interactions are canceled and so there's

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,259
a whole new set of challenges so also if

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,270
you just thrust into this you might not

00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:07,900
have a space at home that's ready your

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:12,340
company might not have be prepared for

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,110
you know remote meetings so I would say

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,479
like if if this is thrust upon you now

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,930
it's not necessarily the best time to be

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,699
figuring this out um so yeah you

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,400
definitely have extra challenges then

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:28,630
you then you have in the past and maybe

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,060
in the future yeah I think personally

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,940
one of the phrases that I had never

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,889
heard of until this this

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,520
shelter-in-place work from home happened

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,550
is hey is is anybody else able to hear

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,520
him talk that's probably one of those

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,630
common situations that I've seen papa

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,630
community community yeah exactly

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,610
so yeah I would say that just even the

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,370
technical barriers have been have been

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,949
fascinating on top of all the social

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:02,370
elements of it Rainie how has it been

00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,750
different for you all over in Pinterest

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,110
it changed a lot

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:10,449
I used to go to office every day and now

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:13,839
I've been working from home since March

00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:16,020
I think I definitely miss seeing my

00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,000
teammates in person

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,539
and right now we have like remote

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,360
meetings sometimes I feel isolated and

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,629
along they are walking home by myself

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,400
but I think the cool side is I have more

00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:33,360
flexibility I can go grocery shopping

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,780
during work time and I can save time on

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,270
commute I think the challenges we still

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,789
have to connect with each other like

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:45,060
interact with each other more often

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:51,919
otherwise we were almost like being

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:54,449
isolated yeah yeah thank you for that so

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,509
switching over to maybe some ways that

00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:00,000
you all have found to try to remain

00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,970
productive in this in this new

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,060
environment what would be some examples

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,430
or tips or suggestions that you would

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,349
have for folks on how to how to attempt

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,240
to remain somewhat productive and I

00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:15,919
think realizing that that's not going to

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,919
necessarily be the same as it was before

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,669
you

00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:31,750
clay so um so a couple of things one is

00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:36,190
this work-life balance it's it's way

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,979
different you're you don't have this

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,930
commute to like change modes going to

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,750
work or coming home so you have to find

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:46,180
other ways to change your your

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,459
perspective and be present whether it's

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,640
at work or family

00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:53,110
maybe that's meditation maybe you know

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,260
there's a lot of ways to deal with that

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,640
maybe you've got your own space but uh

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,020
finding that balance and the thing about

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,520
that I used to have a lot of guilt

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,149
because I thought I had to nail that

00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:08,709
every single day but this is a marathon

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:11,320
not a sprint so I use calendar a lot

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,670
like I you look at a calendar that's my

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,120
schedule this is the time that people

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:19,600
expect me to be certain places virtually

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:24,670
probably and and and adjust everything

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,380
around that and another thing is time

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,140
tracking apps I've never really worked

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,709
for me but uh kind of kind of a hack I

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,329
found is as I like to listen to music

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,890
like on Spotify so I've got these

00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:38,500
playlists that give me new music every

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,589
week and if I haven't made it all the

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,370
way through those that's a sign that hey

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:47,740
maybe I didn't do enough have enough

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,459
Builder time this week right

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,970
I don't know that's that's some of the

00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:57,029
stuff that that's this worked for me I

00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:01,529
really like that Spotify idea yeah Andy

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:05,290
yeah just to build on clays point about

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:06,640
Andres no I you know obviously when we

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,020
were going to the office was very easy

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,160
to separate like you know I get up the

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,040
morning hang out with the family and

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,209
then go to the office work all day come

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,850
home and hang out with the family and

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:17,890
then we went to in a shelter-in-place

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,070
it was you know it was I was

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,260
discombobulated and I ended up you know

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,880
to the marathon not a sprint

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,029
I'd have these sprint days where it's

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,750
like meetings 9:00 to 5:00 and I did it

00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,889
for a couple weeks and it was I mean

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,529
incredibly

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,269
exhausting like zoom conversations for

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,100
whatever reason I think many people feel

00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,869
this way it's just it's like physically

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,249
emotionally exhausting because you're I

00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:42,449
guess you're processing things

00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:44,459
differently and you're trying to figure

00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:46,649
out what people are how they respond to

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,119
you that I think is maybe a normal human

00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,480
interaction we take it for granted so

00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:53,669
anyways what I ended up doing and my

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,949
kids were you know homeschooling as well

00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:58,739
they had a lunch break and so I

00:10:55,949 --> 00:11:06,989
synchronized my calendar with them and

00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:08,910
so I am very do it's time I block off

00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:11,279
there's no meetings I hang out with my

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,179
family have lunch and also just kind of

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,529
decompress and it gives me a new kind of

00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:18,569
energy for the afternoon and one more

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,499
thing I'll say is I increasingly am

00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:23,910
doing just phone calls rather than zoom

00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:25,709
and and wow I love looking at other

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:29,100
people and seeing you know emotions and

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:30,629
facial reactions it's really nice in

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,309
fact someone said earlier they go for

00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:33,569
walks like I go for a walk and I just

00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,119
have a phone call and it's like it's

00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:40,769
it's just it's awesome I love it I look

00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:43,410
forward to those those meetings and so

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:46,049
I'm gonna riff on what what Andy both

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,879
Andy and clay said so Andy I'm totally

00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:50,730
with you about those walking meetings

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:53,069
like like they are so important to get

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,199
off of Zoom to get outside I think being

00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,509
outside is really important when you're

00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:59,399
you know you've got that like some of my

00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,499
days start with Zoom at 8:00 and end

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,179
with zoom at 9:30 at night

00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:05,850
okay and granted some of that's personal

00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:09,089
but it's still all zoom like it's all

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,709
zoom so the walks the regular breaks

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:13,259
with your family especially if you have

00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:15,720
kids like like really being specific

00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:18,829
clay you talked about blocking aside

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,139
time for working the Spotify playlist

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:24,319
you can do like Pomodoro's is another

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,689
technique that some people find useful

00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:28,289
one of the folks on my team uses The

00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,509
Lion King

00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:33,600
plays it all the way through that's the

00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:36,239
block can we get this stuff done in a

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,399
lion king sized interval but having that

00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:39,600
dedicated suffer for me at software

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,610
development time having that really

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,839
dedicated focused time is super

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,870
important

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,240
I wanted to pull up something that maybe

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,579
people haven't thought about and it's

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,350
really engaging your senses while

00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,170
working at home and that that's kind of

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,110
fuzzy and I know it sounds mushy but

00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,709
what you see influences you so what's on

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,420
your Zune

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:03,100
what's your zoom background like if you

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,589
put a tropical scene do you feel more

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,690
relaxed what are you looking at are you

00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:09,250
looking at a wall are you looking at

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,440
monitoring to your are you setup I look

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,910
out a window right I'm in a corner but I

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,649
look out a window what do you you know

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,750
what do you hear do you have headphones

00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:23,110
on can you block a side time or do you

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,880
have ambient noise what do you smell do

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,470
you open a window so you have a breeze

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,279
like all of this stuff can kind of

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,170
alleviate a lot of the tension of

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,760
sitting in your chair for a very long

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,420
period of time is you know if you have a

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,300
harmonious environment around you it can

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:44,829
really help alleviate that and then

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,019
taking those breaks yeah just one

00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:51,339
comment on that real quick I actually

00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:54,579
have found that certain sunnier spaces

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:59,199
that are in my my house or like backyard

00:13:54,579 --> 00:14:02,110
or you know porch or whatnot especially

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,750
ones that have plants have become a lot

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,350
more soothing just to sit around or

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,889
sitting there I I don't know what that

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,230
means

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,639
but it definitely means that I need to

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,970
be better about taking care of plants

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:21,160
that are in my environment

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:24,100
brainy did you have any thoughts yes so

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,610
I'm using an app called forest which I

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,949
can set have a focused time 25 minutes

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,959
intervals like focus 24 minutes and

00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:34,720
restful farming I think it helped me a

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:38,290
lot to stay a focused

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,060
another thing is I'm using the future on

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,430
slack which can mute your messages

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,399
during focus hour and it were changed

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:48,209
status into like a bubble something and

00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:51,730
so that I can focus walking instead of

00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:54,339
disrupted by those messages and the last

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,620
thing is I feel like looking from home

00:14:54,339 --> 00:15:00,940
can either and mix up my person

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:04,300
and walking so I forced myself to shut

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,420
down my laptop every day 6 p.m. to do

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,870
like cut-offs a walk so that I can stay

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,640
more productive during working hours

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:16,590
yeah this really things I can't think

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:20,110
about so a lot of the audience is is

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:23,080
actively developing software and the way

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,000
that we usually are used to doing that

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,610
is maybe we would get into a room and we

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,240
would whiteboard stuff out or we would

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,120
try to just hash out something quickly

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,510
together to get on the same page before

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:40,630
we would start working on things

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:42,520
obviously the get into a room with a

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,350
bunch of people right now is both not

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,850
possible and probably well even if it

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,360
was maybe not the best idea

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:53,320
so how have you what what are ways that

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,890
you've adapted maybe that kind of the

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,800
challenge how have you been able to

00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:01,300
simulator or solve that whiteboard

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,990
whiteboarding need

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:08,110
I think and you had mentioned you had

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,580
some thoughts on this one so actually so

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,230
I have not solved the light boarding

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,410
question that I'd be really curious to

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,540
hear what what people have done also for

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,610
trading code back and forth like that's

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,769
that's actually been a real issue for us

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,660
and so we've been like pasting in slack

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,360
and we're trying to figure out like how

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,250
do we communicate where we are I think

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,779
we might try you know one of the

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,140
techniques we use with interviewing

00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:34,360
candidates if like tri-coat pair and see

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,820
if that works but if people have ideas I

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,670
absolutely love to hear them because the

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:45,070
whiteboarding and the co-development

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:49,540
are really really hard to do rainy or

00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:52,000
clay-like so I don't have an answer for

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,920
the whiteboarding but working on

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,560
spinnaker it's a community project that

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,930
spans multiple companies so in our

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,100
company communication it's always been a

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:06,010
bit of an issue and and I guess we kind

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,839
of get around that with making documents

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,480
requests for comments whenever anybody's

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,770
gonna do a big feature put pour requests

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,300
out early and get feedback on them and

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,970
you know there's a slack community where

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:23,069
you can talk through things

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:26,140
that's good feedback and all that works

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,179
pretty well and and we're kind of used

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,100
to using it since since that's the way

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:34,510
is that we we talk to other companies

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:36,280
like Netflix and Google and so it worked

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,460
it works pretty well in our company as

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,460
well

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,600
Oh for me I think we use Google Talk

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,480
during the team meeting to share some

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,299
ideas or draw diagrams for the team

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,520
another tool is called gem board which

00:17:52,299 --> 00:18:01,299
we can also elect your diagram to

00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:03,669
discuss ideas during yeah I've

00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:05,289
personally witnessed a fair number of

00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:09,010
artists cropping up across the

00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:13,600
organization with a jam board it's

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:16,149
always impressive to me yeah that's what

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,100
I've seen this Jam board is is quite

00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:20,529
impressive for those that have like a

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,299
digital pen and can actually draw it's

00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:24,010
actually quite fun to watch that I have

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:25,539
not used it because I can't draw and I

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,460
don't have a digital pen although I can

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:30,250
order one on Amazon but nevertheless it

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,840
seems very effective

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,750
so on the topic of meeting since I came

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,600
up one of the interesting questions has

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,060
come up I think we touched on the the

00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,340
idea of hey if we have tons of meetings

00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,100
all day it's it's really exhausting it's

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,820
exhausting in a way that I think none of

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,890
us really fully expected because it

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,660
doesn't seem like it should right it

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,710
seems like that's a similar schedule to

00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,270
what we used to have and we're not

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,750
having to get up and move from room to

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:03,020
room so why is it more exhausting to

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,360
have over over over Xoom is an

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,850
interesting question but maybe we also

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,680
have too many of them and maybe there's

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:14,570
ways that we can identify the ones that

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,280
we don't need or maybe there's other

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,810
ways that we can get that kind of

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,250
discussion or alignment without

00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:25,550
necessarily having to have everybody

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:28,910
synchronously on a video chat slowly

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:33,980
draining their their energy levels any

00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:35,150
ideas or thoughts on meetings and I'll

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,450
let you go ahead and take it before I

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:40,370
keep babbling so no so Andy Andy

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,560
mentioned earlier zoom fatigue so I was

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,420
curious last night Andy and being a good

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,670
engineer I did some research there are

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:50,150
ninety four point five million Google

00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,440
search results for Zoom fatigue and why

00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,760
did I search for this I was looking at

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,020
another article written about a month

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,110
ago and there were sixty something

00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:00,050
million article search results on Zoom

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:05,420
fatigue so it's real it's growing it's a

00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:08,200
huge challenge right and I do think that

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,070
making sure you get those breaks is

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,190
absolutely essential but I'd like to

00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:16,450
hear what people do on their breaks to

00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,450
alleviate that fatigue

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,299
clay

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:27,960
so so to me it's not really the number

00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:30,659
of meetings it's like what what type of

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,490
meetings could be async instead right

00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:37,380
and for us I guess I guess we've been

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,240
trying to push more and more to see the

00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,340
boundaries of what we can do a sink

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:46,650
whether it's talking over slack or and

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:48,840
documents things that usually are better

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,230
to not be a sink and a real soon call

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:55,380
are things like some more organic things

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,360
some types of planning where you want to

00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,179
do some brainstorming pair programming

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,280
works pretty good over zoom and just

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:05,549
sometimes we schedule time to get

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:08,130
together and not directly talk about

00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:10,320
work and just build some rapport um I

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,929
guess the balance isn't that different

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,990
than when I was in the office of

00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:19,110
thinking of it in terms of like how much

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,570
III want time to build something useful

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,950
but I need enough meetings to get the

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,110
context to know that I'm actually

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,750
building something useful so I need just

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,030
enough time in meetings to know I'm on

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,789
the right track and and then you know

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:36,049
hopefully quite a bit of time to build

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:36,049
that and put stuff in front of people

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:45,550
one one tip that I have I think it was

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,470
something that I is is it was discussed

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:51,820
a long time ago before there's this

00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:54,610
video chat our video situation had had

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:58,090
really become the common way of

00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:00,700
interacting but it was that you know try

00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,170
to have an agenda clearly outlined ahead

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,360
of the meeting time and then once you've

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:07,810
covered the agenda your best to cut that

00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,180
meeting short give that time back

00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,430
because it's very easy when you've

00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,650
booked at that time to want to consume

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,320
it and it doesn't preclude people from

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:21,190
interacting and and and having that

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,990
social time if necessary but it doesn't

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,420
require everybody to be synchronously

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,610
doing that and I found that to be

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,260
something that has been helpful when

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,570
that happens and I'm in a lot of Andy's

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:36,400
meetings so I'm just you know making a

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:39,820
point when we cover the agenda any any

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,450
other thoughts on this one yeah so I

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:45,580
tend to so there so there those zoom

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,840
calls you have to be on and contributing

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,430
and like this one right you have to be

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,590
visually present you're talking you're

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,150
you're really hashing things out with

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,190
your team and then they're the calls

00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,730
where you just have to listen and maybe

00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:00,070
watch the slides so for those I'm

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,720
outside and I try to be in a different

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,950
place outside every time or I'm walking

00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,690
or I'm just not at my desk and that

00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,880
really helps a lot because I finally can

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,430
even focus more on the the context of

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,680
the call when I'm not stuck there like

00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:18,240
pin to my computer and my body is saying

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,240
get up and move get up and move

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:26,330
so we've got about it looks like three

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,480
or four minutes left so I'd like to

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:33,249
switch over to maybe advice that you

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:37,100
would give to individuals or companies

00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:40,039
in how to support work from home better

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:42,649
I think clay had has a lot of experience

00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,570
in this space especially and so maybe

00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:47,629
started off with you clay what would you

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,730
what would you recommend for you

00:23:47,629 --> 00:23:51,739
dividuals or for companies it's

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,239
certainly easier to work remotely if

00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:55,489
you're working at a company that

00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:58,759
embraces that like thankfully all right

00:23:55,489 --> 00:24:01,609
does that means meeting rooms set up so

00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:05,419
that it's easy to bring people in slack

00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:08,269
lots of async tools you don't want to be

00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:10,820
the old guy working remote because you

00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:13,070
miss stuff right and so trying to record

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,499
and make that stuff available if you if

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:18,139
you don't happen to be there just keeps

00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:21,859
everybody on the same page individually

00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:25,039
I'd say just like everything else enjoy

00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:26,509
be present and enjoy what what you're

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,429
doing while you're doing it like embrace

00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:30,259
the flexibility of working remotely find

00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:32,179
what works for you take some time to

00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:34,940
appreciate stuff that you're able to do

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,279
remotely whether it's being able to

00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,200
prepare a nice dinner and with your

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,820
family or attendant kids school event

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,239
like take some time and think hey I'm

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:47,299
I'm doing this because I didn't have to

00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:49,129
be somewhere at a certain time and have

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:51,249
a commute and you stuck and that sort of

00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:51,249
thing

00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:01,990
really were in I think for me I feel

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,120
like remote walking makes me hard to

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,600
speak during large team meetings

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,850
sometimes I easily stay muted forever so

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,880
I took some speaking training classes

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:15,279
from internal training website and I

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,250
feel like it helped a lot so that I can

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,610
have some skills how to present better

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:24,070
during to meeting remotely yes in maybe

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:28,990
company can provide more trainings like

00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:31,000
that yeah that's that's phenomenal

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,380
that's fascinating yeah I'm sorry sorry

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,490
and I didn't mean to interrupt you I was

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,169
about to say I think that's I think

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,480
that's a great idea I think also zoom

00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:39,880
breakout rooms where you you know you

00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,220
have your introverts right you give them

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,190
a safer a safer place to talk so

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,340
breaking down your meetings the one

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:50,289
thing I would love it if people could

00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:54,820
take away from at least my part of this

00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:56,559
this panel is when we're under stress we

00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,200
tend to react quickly we tend to react

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,260
with our gut reactions and our gut

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,850
reactions are often have often contain

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,799
more implicit bias because we're

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:09,039
thinking fast rather than thinking slow

00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:11,940
and this is a really really important

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,490
time to be an advocate to be an ally to

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,080
think about inclusion on all your teams

00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,000
whether you're including the introverts

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,380
whether you're including people with

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,799
other backgrounds and you really need to

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:29,740
really be aware and really engage

00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:34,000
everyone especially people who maybe

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:37,140
don't have the privileges or the the

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,140
advantages that you have

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,740
Thank You Ann I would go to Andy but as

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,690
we all know what the work from home

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:51,169
situation is like there is some

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,210
technical challenges there so we won't

00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:55,010
be able to go over to that but I did

00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,970
want to say in the last probably 30

00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,390
seconds that we have

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,440
I really really appreciate everybody

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:04,190
participating in this panel I think it's

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:08,960
been a really fascinating challenging

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:10,179
time and I think hopefully folks all the

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,799
folks that are listening to this

00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:17,090
understand that everybody is going

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:19,789
through this empathy and patience is so

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:22,370
important at this time I may be now more

00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,520
than ever so please be nice to each

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,020
other give each other space I

00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,200
fortunately had 30 minutes free where my

00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:33,260
two kids didn't run into the room which

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,530
is is actually not the most terrible

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,840
part of it all anyway so thank you again

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,470
and thank you for joining and thank you

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:46,419
for all the thoughtful comments thank

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,419
