Title: Fast & Fearless: Achieving Speed Because of Safety @ Spinnaker.Live
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: Spinnaker.Live 2020
Description: 
	The Continuous Delivery Foundation seeks to improve the worldâ€™s capacity to deliver software with security and speed. High-performing organizations use software to deliver greater value. Of course, every org wants to improve performance and value capture. SDLC security and speed are crucial to that transformation. How can we achieve them? 

This interactive panel of innovators in software delivery workflow automation discuss why both security and speed matter, and how data, psychological safety, fear, race and humanity factor in.

	00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,520
going live

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,480
right now all right so without further

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,880
ado

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,799
uh because we jam-packed this schedule

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
with literally so much content because

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,920
we had so many awesome people who want

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,039
to be part of it so no regrets there you

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
don't have to listen to me talking for

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,080
long

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
i would like to go into a panel

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,560
discussion

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,800
that uh i'm very very excited about

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,480
and so the first thing we should do is

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
probably give people an opportunity to

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,279
introduce themselves we're going to keep

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,239
our intros pretty short

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,399
so that we can uh talk about stuff so

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,920
i'll start down the line uh

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,160

hi everyone i'm constance carminellis

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,159
i'm a software engineer at splunk

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,600
and i am based out of sf

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,640

you may know him hello i'm brian lyles

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
i'm a software engineer at vmware and

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,720
i'm based out of

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,119
washington dc oh i didn't even know that

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,240
learn something new every day okay next

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,479
claire

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
hey i'm claire ligouri i'm a principal

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,000
engineer at aws and i'm based out of the

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,079
seattle area

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,600
superstars on the call all right so

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
first thing i want to talk about is

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,320
something i'm obsessed with

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,840
psychological safety

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,360
amy edmondson coined the term

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,560
psychological safety in

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,640
1999 it's gotten some lip service

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,799
especially since google published the

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,720
rework study a few years ago

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,360
and found psychological safety to be a

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,680
foundational dynamic in successful teams

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,520
so what i want to ask is why does why

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,799
does psychological safety matter in

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,880
software development

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,159
and first on that question i wanted to

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,640
talk talk to don

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,399
because don has a masters in psychology

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,280
as well as a lot of experience in

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,879
in software so over to you don right

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
thanks

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,800
part of the psychological safety is

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
being having it be okay to make a

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,840
mistake

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,040
if you're going to move fast if you're

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,599
going to deploy

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,280
every day mistakes are going to be made

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,000
and you don't want to be

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,800
like having everyone to point fingers

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
and blame

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,879
and shame so that psychological safety

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
is something that makes it okay to take

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,560
a risk

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,239
and knowing that if something goes wrong

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,560
your job isn't going to be

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
on the line now that's not saying you

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,599
can go and do something

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,959
over the top and still have a job

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,440
there is a line there that you don't

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,080
want to cross but um

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,120
everyday mistakes shouldn't result in

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,120
like panic and dread

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,159
i i think that's simply put and that's

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
nice anyone by the way we're doing a

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,040
hand raising thing with hands so put

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
your hand up if you want to talk and i

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,800
will

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,239
call on you yeah brian i was going to

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,159
call on you because i know you lead

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,879
engineering teams right so

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,080
what what do you have to say yeah yeah

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,200
so i am in

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,200
tech leadership at vmware uh

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,599
highest black employee in the whole

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,400
entire 31 000 person company

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,519
will go me um i do a lot of mentoring

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
and it's actually

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,360
it's interesting that don said that we

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
talk a lot about psychological safety

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,959
and what i tell engineers i tell them

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,760
something very simple uh you're going to

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,360
fall

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,120
in it and you're going to fail now

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
do you want an organization that knows

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,280
you're going to fall and

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,120
buffers it or catches you or do you want

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,360
an organization that

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,239
lets you fall and laugh at you and then

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
also

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,440
how can you change your organization to

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,959
catch other people

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,480
and it's something very important that i

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,480
tell engineers all the time

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
well said yeah do you want that at the

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,080
end of the day that's the question right

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,439
that we were all asking anyone i'm

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,319
looking at i'm looking for the hands

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,439
claire

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,840
go claire so i think um i think the

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,920
point about you know not losing your job

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,599
if you if you make a mistake is so

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,320
important and

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,000
i think from the sort of once you've

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,799
made that mistake it's really important

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,880
about how your

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,880
your organization reacts to that right

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,120
so one of the things that we do

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,160
we build a lot of tools around this

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
around um

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
sort of post-mortem analysis right and

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,880
so it's important to

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
um to focus on the process instead of

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
the person that

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,800
that um was impacted by a lack of

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,759
process or a lack of guardrails

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
basically

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,199
and so um we have a process we

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,240
we use the term bar raiser a lot too in

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,040
different areas

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
um to basically a set of people who are

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
really

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,880
um really high judgment about this

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,639
really experienced about this

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,639
and so one of the things we have is

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,560
effectively postmortem bar raisers who

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,919
are responsible for making sure that

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,400
you know we're not blaming the person we

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,600
don't name the person we always say

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,919
an engineer followed these steps

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,919
um and these steps were were wrong and

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,560
we need to fix these steps so that

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,600
somebody else doesn't doesn't um fall

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,080
into the same

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,080
mistakes

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,280
yeah and this is a bad time to flip

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,080
through accelerate and look for the

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
quote that

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,800
says what you're talking about i think

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,479
you proved that out go ahead constance

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,639
yeah i actually think exactly your point

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,240
it's like it ends up at least like when

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
mistakes happen it's like what question

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
do you ask and it's always

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,120
i think the healthier way to ask it is

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,199
like how did we

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,720
fail together instead of making it very

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,000
individual it's like how did the tools

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,919
that we provided

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
you know to the team and how we observe

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,639
things how did that fail

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,720
us right and at least

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,639
putting the onus on terms of like how

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
the process and how we do engineering

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,080
and how we roll things out like

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,199
analyzing what were the gaps there and

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,319
not saying it's

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,360
a person or you know yeah

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,360
pretty much don't blame it on

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
individuals

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
so i want to dig into that a little bit

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,639
more you you both talked about

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,319
tools and kind of how tools can support

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,680
psychological safety for developers or

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,479
tools are part of the puzzle when you're

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
doing a

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,080
doing an analysis so how can tools

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,360
help us support psychological safety uh

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,039
what what do you

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,199
go ahead brian yeah so

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,080
tools are interesting and there's good

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,840
and bad

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,440
the good is that tools don't have

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,440
feelings and

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,720
garbage in same garbage to come out on

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,479
the other side

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,000
um the bad part about tools is that

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,720
they're programmed wrong

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
garbage goes in and really bad stuff

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,919
comes out of the

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,919
other side but we should use tools to

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,160
promote fairness and to promote

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,199
the ability to do things over and over

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,599
again at the

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
at the same way because us as humans

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
will decide that we want to change it

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
and we will change it even

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,400
subconsciously i'm sure don knows that

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,160
pretty well but um i'm not even i'm not

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,400
i'm not a psychologist and i don't

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,960
understand the brain but i even i know

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,840
that

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,800
um i change how i do things if i do it

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,560
more than once

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,199
so tools help us not do that

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,039
yeah and i mean one thing that brings us

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,479
all here is automation and what you're

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,840
what you're pointing out is that's like

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,680
the first step to getting to

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,039
automation is like getting to the point

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
where you can do it

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,800
know how to do it the same way every

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
time can't have automation without that

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,919
so it's almost like

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,440
that process is part of the discovery

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,000
process that leads us to be able to

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,599
automate

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,280
maybe kind of what i'm thinking

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,479
any other thoughts on this before i move

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,199
on to another oh go ahead drew

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,039
yeah um so what i was going to say is

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,879
one of my prior jobs focus was a

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,160
physical safety we had a

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,560
um we had an an executive there

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,479
uh throw a chair across the room and so

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,680
that was that was an interesting

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,039
situation but before um you know

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,840
before that term kind of was being used

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,919
in the circles that

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,360
that i was running in some of the other

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,360
like terms

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,199
that we would use you know trust empathy

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,840
shared ownership through collaboration

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,360
and definitely blameless culture

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,199
you know talking to a lot of the really

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,039
mature teams out there that have all of

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,639
these tools in place

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,000
definitely made them made it easier for

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,960
them to focus more on the cultural

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,960
aspect

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,479
but i would say maybe in consulting some

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,520
teams that are kind of working more

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,120
towards

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,120
starting to build out those devops

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
capabilities a really good

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
um you know recommendation and thing

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,159
that i saw that helped them

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,719
was focusing on even just collecting the

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,800
data and like democratizing data across

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,040
teams so that um you know when you do go

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,360
into one of those sessions

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,959
you know where you're doing a postmortem

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,839
you actually have the data at hand and

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,120
it's and it's not a subjective

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,440
conversation

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,480
that's a good point yeah that what data

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,519
you have really

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,040
really shapes the agency that folks have

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,959
to be part of that conversation

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,480
it's a good point and there was one

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,480
other thing i wanted to i forgot about i

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,959
want to ask that came up in our pre-call

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,000
uh constance you had an interesting

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,240
thought on

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,920
how does fear factor into software

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,040
delivery right and maybe you can talk a

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,720
little bit about the relationship

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,959
between fear and psychological safety

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,600
and

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,800
what your thoughts are on that actually

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,480
dawn had her hand up i don't know if she

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
wants to finish oh we'll see

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,080
i said i was doing it and then i didn't

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
do it go ahead don and then

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
and then you're cute constance thanks

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
constance i wanted to address

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,800
the the tools piece part of

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
psychological safety and making mistakes

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,959
is learning

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,360
from those mistakes and

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
having tools can help you learn things

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,920
that you didn't know about

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,720
your applications whether it's

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,440
observability tools alerting tools

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,920
running experiments uh all of those

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,560
things

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,360
are we rely on our tools kind of help us

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
with that

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,320
and that gives us the knowledge to

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,040
learn more and uh dig deeper into what's

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
going on

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,600
within our applications yeah totally and

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
thinking about that from the perspective

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
of spinnaker people use spinnaker so

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,079
that the wider business can

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,000
actually learn can do a b testing or do

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,680
feature testing of different features so

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
it's almost like if you have a safe

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,600
culture

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,279
for software to to move fast in that way

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,320
then that opens the door for software to

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,000
become the tool

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,240
that helps your whole business learn how

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,399
to do better faster

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:36,959
so sort of like a domino effect i think

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,959
constance or anything else john

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,000
um yeah so the thing that i had brought

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,959
up during or like

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,399
pre-talk was that i think there is a

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,519
little bit of a healthy amount of fear i

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
guess like kind of like maybe if we make

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,240
the parallettes like children right like

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,360
on a play park like or you know

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
playground like they know they shouldn't

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,680
jump off the slide

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
like you know like a little bit healthy

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,240
amount of fear and making that parallel

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,120
where sometimes

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,760
at least and maybe and i guess i kind of

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,519
wanted to like

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,880
so the time where i think it's good to

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,560
phrase a little bit like

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,079
when you're deploying something like you

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,360
know like assessing the risk

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,800
like do i actually understand the risk

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,000
what are the potential impacts and

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
that's kind of more what it would

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,360
mean about fears at least like if you if

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,279
you don't know those things

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,399
maybe you shouldn't be deploying right

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,440
or like maybe where you should be

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
testing things out within a safe

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,880
environment and so

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
at least understanding what are the

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,519
potential negative impact

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,160
repercussions of deployment and then

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,240
helping you assess that because

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,519
sometimes just being a cowboy isn't

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,040
really fun for everyone around

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,959
as much fun as it can be sometimes in

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,680
the moment

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,880
absolutely and you use the word safe so

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
i want to dig into that a little bit

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,000
because that's something also we talk

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,800
about a lot at armory and a lot with

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,560
spinnaker what does safety even mean

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,880
when it comes to software delivery i

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,920
know claire has some thoughts on this

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,360
she thinks a lot about you know being

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,399
really safe without slowing down devs

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
constants also want to hear your

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,720
thoughts so

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,160
good yeah it's interesting because um

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,000
you know when you talk about safety

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,920
versus speed often

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,279
what i hear people talking about speed

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,240
is getting something

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,160
fully um fully delivered to production

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399
and so they really work on

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,600
you know how can we make our pipelines

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,560
finish in

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,680
five minutes or an hour um and we tend

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,200
to think about it a little bit

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,120
differently we think about

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
um you know trading off developer

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,120
productivity with

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,839
the speed of the pipeline and safety and

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,000
effectively

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
it goes back to risk is what constance

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,800
was saying around

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,399
you know what is what is the risk that

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,959
we're having around speeding up

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,079
um speeding up deployments and so

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,200
typically what we do

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,360
our pipelines actually take um at least

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,040
a week typically across different aws

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,560
service teams sometimes up to

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,720
two weeks that sounds really slow um

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,320
but one of the things we do is that it's

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,760
pretty fast to get to production and

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,240
then there's this very slow

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,680
progressive delivery in production

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,200
because we don't want to have this

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,200
massive blast radius

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,600
of deploying everywhere within five

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,720
minutes um but on the developer

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,240
productivity side

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,839
they don't have to sit there and watch

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,880
the pipeline for

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,880
for two weeks um often when i talk to

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,480
customers who are trying to implement

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,959
continuous deployment

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,399
um they have their developers for every

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,600
automated deployment sitting there

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,519
watching the dashboard

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,320
like waiting to click that roll back

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,959
button um and we don't want developers

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,560
doing that right we want them to kind of

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,839
honestly forget about it

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,760
push their code and forget about it and

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,680
let the pipeline take care of it

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,959
and so we have to put those safety

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,680
mechanisms in place

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,519
like very slow roll out in production

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,480
even if it gets to production within

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,160
you know an hour it's really um it's

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
really safe once it gets into production

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,839
because it's so slow and it's

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,839
automatically rolling back

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,440
i'm gonna give it some time to call the

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,600
next person oh go ahead brian

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
right so that's an interesting place

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,839
that we get into

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
that when you

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,920
i wouldn't say it's the problem that

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,880
your engineers are looking at their

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,480
city deployment and deployment

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,680
dashboards waiting for things to come

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,279
out or even their

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,839
ci dashboards i think it's because

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,639
we we miss more work and trusting the

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
system

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,560
you should know after a while that if

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,839
your build breaks

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,000
or your delivery is is somehow

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,680
fail some kind of check but it just does

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
the right thing but we don't trust our

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,360
tools

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,519
so we go and we look at it and we we get

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,079
real close to the screen and we stare at

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,000
it

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,000
and i think whenever we're addressing

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
whatever this cause is it's not looking

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
at your dashboards be happy you have

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,320
them

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,399
try to address the other thing that is

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
the unspoken thing of why they actually

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,279
do that

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,880
maybe it's um psychological um maybe

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,800
they get yelled at if they don't

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,000
or maybe it's they don't trust the whole

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,839
system so

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,839
something to think about

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,120
that's a that's a really good point it

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,120
ties really nicely back to

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,720
drew i see you're unmuted yeah go ahead

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,480
yeah i was just gonna say um

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
having gone through and worked with

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,880
other uh teams who have gone through

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,920
you know setting up continuous delivery

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,040
and moving into

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,959
continuous deployment you know i've

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,880
seen a lot of people where there's

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,279
concern about making that kind of final

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,519
leap

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,360
and after you after you do and give

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,199
yourself the ability

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,440
to get code quickly out the door and

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,759
quickly roll back or roll forward

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,199
um and and get that continuous feedback

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,240
from from what's happening

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,600
um it's amazing how much anxiety it

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,519
actually reduces like

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,759
um kind of opening the floodgate like

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,320
that um so

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,399
especially for me um you know there had

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,079
some hesitant hesitancy in doing that

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,079
the first time but

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,800
after after getting in that situation is

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,800
actually a relief

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,920
so we're talking around we're talking

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,320
around a little bit about

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
um like that that trade-off between the

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,399
speed of delivering new features

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,519
and then kind of oh are did you raise

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,639
your hand constants

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,560
no no and then i was all excited about

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,800
what you had to say um

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,759
about so sort of like that that traded

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,360
off um

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,880
and safety and compliance is on the

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,880
other side of that trade-off and the

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,720
tricky thing about safety and compliance

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,320
i've seen is that and i think i said

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,839
this earlier in another uh

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,560
chat was like every sdlc is a snowflake

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,399
like every

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,480
company has its own very specific

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,360
requirements its own regulatory

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,120
uh constraints um and in their own

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,839
values that they have to that they want

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,920
to serve out

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,120
their own business purposes so is it

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,040
possible for all

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,959
organizations to be both fast and safe

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,880
kind of want to talk about that and like

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,560
can you talk about any features or pro

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,240
projects that you've worked on that

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,959
specifically

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
give people that ability or enhance that

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,520
ability to allow

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,760
any organization even if it's snowflakey

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,120
to address those security and compliance

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,799
requirements

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:22,319
long question

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,600
brian spotlight yeah so

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,360
you know what i'm gonna be the first

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,880
person to say that if you have that

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,400
why are you on this call you should be

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,440
out counting all the money that you made

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,480
last week

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,039
uh no one has that

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,760
but what there is something you can have

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,919
and

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,600
uh we've learned throughout the years uh

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,400
the value of frameworks

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,280
and there is it is possible to create a

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,400
framework

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,080
that allows you to scale up this type of

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
practice within a small company

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,559
something on your desktop to something

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,799
going to

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,240
maybe you're deploying to azure because

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
they're not represented here so i want

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,840
to talk about them

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,039
or maybe you have your own private cloud

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,360
running on

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,960
on your own local hardware but when it

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,120
comes down to it there is

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
actually a small framework you can put

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,600
in place um

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
i'm going to talk about it i'm going to

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,880
take my own horn this is something i

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,160
actually i'm an r d engineer

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,120
at vmware and half my job is spent on

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,360
research

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,240
and what i've been researching is this

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,440
theory that

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,880
we can break down delivery into

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,480
three things and this is crazy because

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
i've never talked about it before but

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,080
you have

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,520
basically the state and then you have

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,880
that's that's what you want to deploy

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
what is it doesn't matter it's just a

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,360
state

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,480
and the state has a resolver and it

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,559
resolves to something

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
and then you have an invoker and what

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,679
does that come from well somebody wanted

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
to deploy they pushed a button

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
or a time happened or or commit a

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
repository

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,720
and then you have a reconciler that

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,919
takes that state and pushes it to where

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,840
it needs to be

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,360
and if we can start building from first

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,640
principles instead of just saying we're

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,200
going to have spinnaker

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,320
or we're going to have drone or we're

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,080
going to have something else

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,440
we actually solved the problem without

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,840
our technology

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,559
and our tools um i think would be better

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,039
and i think what

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,320
really what i'm saying is that as humans

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,080
we love to solve

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,440
problem with tools we know rather than

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,600
defining the problem

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,799
at a generic way and then applying what

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,960
we know to it or

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,400
inventing it or buying it and if we did

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,919
it that way we probably could find

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
solutions that work from

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,840
you know your two-person startup to a

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,520
company the size of

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,200
amazon just the thought

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,919
love it and want to join that open

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,919
source project

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,559
any other thoughts on that i'll go i

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,160
think um i think i'm echoing brian a

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,039
little bit here around

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,280
um i think it's it's not just tools you

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,600
have to pair the tools with

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,960
um a people process with a with a

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,799
judgment process

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,720
so um one of the things that that we do

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,640
is um you know we have a lot of

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
pipelines at amazon and so

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
one of the things we look at sort of

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,559
across the company is a group of people

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,440
actually sits down

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,320
and looks at um every postmortem across

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,559
the company

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,559
related to a deployment and says what

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,679
what do we think is this sort of generic

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,480
root cause here

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,280
was it a lack of canary monitoring was

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,480
it a lack

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,360
of um of integration tests before

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,400
production

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,720
or was it a lack of a canary deployment

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,240
and we start to see those trends across

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,799
the company and then we can start to

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,000
look at

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,320
okay what are the things we want to

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,360
build that these teams need to sort of

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,919
prevent some of these

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,440
these issues and so um sort of all that

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,799
to say i think it's important to

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,880
um to you know start from

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,000
sort of human judgment about what's

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,840
going on

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,360
instead of just kind of building tools

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,840
for building tools

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,880
um and i will do a little bit of a plug

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,799
um

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,039
today on the amazon builders library

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,000
which is a website where we put together

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,919
what our internal processes are um an

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,280
article that i wrote about how exactly

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,720
we do pipelines and what are all of

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,200
those things that we identified that we

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,919
needed in our pipelines and automation

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,799
um landed on the site today i got it

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,799
published just in time so it's good

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,640
um so i'll i'll share the link if i can

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
yeah go ahead and share it in the chat

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,919
session and then drew you did you have

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,640
some thoughts

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,080
uh yeah i was just gonna say um i've

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,200
worked with some really

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,120
brilliant product owners in the past and

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,640
just you know been really lucky to do

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,919
that and

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,679
um i just i love the the thought process

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,760
that they go through when it comes to

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,559
building uh software

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,240
and breaking down the problem before you

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,919
before you even start looking at tools

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
and so i just when it comes to

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,640
you know building pipelines or

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,120
infrastructure as code

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,480
i'm always just trying to put my my

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
product hat on

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,000
before jumping into tools and i think

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,480
that really helps

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,360
um you know give me the right type of

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
insight as to

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,280
you know when that tooling decision

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,440
comes right

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,400
you know it's i'm not taking a step

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,600
necessarily in

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
in the wrong direction so

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,559
good thoughts okay i think brian touched

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,840
on this a little bit with his uh

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,559
framework

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,240
teaser um but i i do want to know what

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,360
what folks on this call what do you

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,520
think is still

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,679
missing in software development and

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,880
delivery workflow automation

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,200
what advancements are you looking

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,039
forward to or seeing or driving right

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,640
now

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,400
and i think drew you had an answer on

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,600
this uh you wanted to

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,919
talk to us a little bit about your

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,600
continuous intelligence platform right

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,360
yeah yeah we'll move we'll move the

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,919
shameless plugs around around the table

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,840
uh no

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,440
this is actually why i joined sumo logic

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,039
so um

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,520
i'm really interested in making it

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,880
easier to benchmark software delivery

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,280
performance and provide

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
teams and even at the organizational

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
level

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,480
with real time like actionable insights

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,039
that they need to continuously improve

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,240
and optimize on how they deliver

00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:56,720
software um

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,000
the reason why i joined sumo is in

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,400
trying to do some of that work in the

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
past

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
right it's it's really difficult not

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,679
only because

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,760
um you know you have a day job and

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,039
trying to do what you need to do

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,120
and you know going off and trying to

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,159
build that as a you know as a side

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,720
project

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,760
but um it's just the amount of tools and

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
technologies

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,559
uh that have kind of made their way into

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,039
the development and delivery pipeline

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,640
has made a challenge to derive some of

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,159
the the key metrics

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,880
that um you know some of the industry

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,720
accepted key metrics uh needed to help

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,880
kind of benchmark performance and and

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,320
give teams the insights they need on

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,559
the data-driven insights right on where

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,159
they need to to focus to

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,080
to improve um so correlating that type

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,360
of data across all of those tools is a

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,799
challenge and so that's what that's what

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
we're really focused on

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,720
um especially me that's what i'm really

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,480
focused on here at sumo logic is being

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,520
able to provide

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,919
teams the ability to um

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,520
you know set up a dashboarding just you

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,679
know in minutes like have a really easy

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,200
out of the box experience where they can

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,640
you know whether they have whether they

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,720
have jenkins or whether they have

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,919
bitbucket pipeline or whether they have

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,360
you know git lab or github it doesn't

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,880
matter what the tool is

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,200
you bring your you bring your tools

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,760
together and

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,240
plug them in and ingest them into sumo

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,400
logic

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,919
and we automatically take those logs

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,279
correlate data across

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,120
all of those separate tools and bring

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,520
them together just in an easy way to

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,400
help

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,880
uh delivery teams understand where they

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
sit

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,279
and then you know again like like all

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,799
analytics platforms right provide the

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,760
underlying logs to give them that

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,679
feedback

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,080
to focus to help them focus somewhere to

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,080
improve

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,159
sounds really exciting and oh go ahead

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,840
constance definitely something we're

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,080
interested in integrating into spinnaker

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,559
and we're gonna talk to splunk team move

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,720
out uh talk to the sumo logic team about

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,159
plug-ins go ahead constance i'd splunk

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,039
on the brain um

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,240
no i guess right that's where um but so

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,679
i guess

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,799
you're kind of bringing up like the data

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,640
aspect of it and then after i think that

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,080
and also a little bit more to what like

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
brian was saying is that like you know

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,679
like

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,000
you know going back to first principles

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,240
is that how and i think this may be how

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,080
i

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,679
interpret what he's saying there is like

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,320
how we ask the question shapes the

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,720
answer

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,840
and we're so used to you know like

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,039
saying like okay well this is my

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,120
immediate problem and this is how i'm

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,720
going to fix it because these two exist

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,640
and actually see that a lot in terms of

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,559
how people are gathering data is like

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
um i'm actually a big fan of tracing and

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,080
i think that tracing should be actually

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,679
like the first class like in terms of

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,559
gathering you know data around things

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,200
um whole i can spend hours talking about

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,760
that

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,360
um but then we i feel like a lot of

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,799
people end up getting so

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,000
stuck in terms like oh i'm going to make

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,120
this a metric or a log and they're

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,720
forgetting to ask themselves like what

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,000
am i actually trying to pay attention to

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960
and like how do i connect these things

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,559
here and then after like

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,320
trying to find there's really cool ways

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,039
you can connect traces and metrics and

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,559
logs

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,240
all that together and like that can

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,880
actually give you much richer thing and

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,559
so

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,000
it's just another deep dive in terms of

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,640
like what data do you actually

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,760
want to like what questions are you

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,520
actually trying to answer

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,200
right like is it success rate probably

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,400
not right because success rate is good

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,679
in terms of telling you something's up

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,880
or down but like you probably care more

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,039
about like hey can my

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,440
you know customers actually buy

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,799
something can my customers you know

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,600
you know go to this page thing here and

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,039
then i have to change a little bit of

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,120
how we do that measurement

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,400
so i don't know the data matters it just

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,240
you have to make sure you're asking the

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,159
right question beforehand

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,080
be intentional about it is what i'm

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,640
hearing yeah

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,000
and actually okay so on that note if

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,960
this next question makes you

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,120
uncomfortable

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,640
that's a very common response i can

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,320
relate and i've recently been learning

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
more about this phenomenon there's a

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,559
term

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
called for it and it's called white

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,039
fragility i'd like to bring it up

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,120
also that's a great book title to check

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,960
out but if we can look beyond i know we

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
talk about the pipeline problem that's

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,279
something that happens

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,480
a lot or offering to mentor people of of

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,240
color

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,159
let's move beyond that i want to talk to

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,159
you about how should we

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,640
as technologists really use our

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,799
influence to support anti-racism

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,880
and be part of making social justice a

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,159
reality i know it's on our minds today

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,679
i want to hear what you have to say

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,960
and i have stuff to say if you yeah

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,960
dawn anyone

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,000
oh i was gonna give a brian raised his

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,120
hand so he could go first

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,279
you can think while brian's talking so

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,080
you asked how do we make social justice

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,080
a reality

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,799
uh i would actually put out there that

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,600
um as a you know as a black man in

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,880
america

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,840
i don't know and i'd be 44

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,880
in i don't know two weeks three weeks

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,000
something like that

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,159
and all 44 of my years um

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,080
i've seen this the last couple weeks had

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,240
not even been bad for me

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,679
there's definitely been worse weeks um

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,440
i'm glad to see this

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,960
but how do we make how do we actually

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,200
make this a real thing

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,399
well what we need to understand is that

00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,760
you need empathy

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,320
it's not that i don't want anyone

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,559
feeling sorry for me that you know i'm

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,000
i'm having black problems this week

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,840
really what i want people to understand

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,039
is that the fact that i am having back

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,720
problems this week means that you're

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,200
having black problems too

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,120
and for us all to be better you're going

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,279
to have to get out of your comfort zone

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,440
and and fix whatever you can and you

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,320
can't fix everything because you can't

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,919
but you can affect something and don't

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,279
excuse your racist relatives that

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,039
doesn't make me feel any better when you

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,320
tell me you have a racist uncle

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,000
because you still go hang out with them

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,120
at thanksgiving so i just wanted to

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,880
leave that

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,399
no thank you for that and i i like what

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,760
you said i think when i thought about my

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,799
answer to this question it's like my

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,559
answer is

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,039
i don't know and there are reasons for

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,679
that and i can i can say more but i want

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,960
to let uh

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,240
let constants go because she had her

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,600
hand raised and then dawn's on the line

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,720
too

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,520
or john do you want to go first because

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,640
you said you're gonna think about it

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,120
sure okay um it

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,240
it may seem small but like when i give

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,880
presentations

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,640
i do a lot of effort to make sure that

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,760
the pictures and the photos that i'm

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,240
displaying

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,480
are diverse and representative if you do

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,080
like a google image search or

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,520
use on splash or like whatever it is

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,440
that you use for images

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,679
generally speaking the majority of

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,720
images that show up are white people

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,080
you have to work harder to find not

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,720
something on the first page

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,000
like dig deeper to have a little bit of

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,360
representation

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,880
um so that when you're speaking to

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,600
people they say like oh like i can see

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
myself

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,279
um in those screens and it may not be a

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,039
big thing

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:35,919
but it's like a small step towards

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,440
something else yeah and taking those

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,840
small steps is really important

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,960
constants yeah and i think maybe it's

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,320
also

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,360
the thing that needs to be i guess like

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,440
i need to remind myself

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,039
and then for everyone that comes from a

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,480
position of privilege is that it is

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,120
actually our problem and we can't just

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,080
defer

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,520
like it's such a lazy point to do

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,880
because it's like well i'm not affected

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,399
by it's like no but like what about like

00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,120
we're in a society and we're supposed to

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,399
actually

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,240
care about every like you know caring

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,840
about everyone does make our society

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,320
better and so like if there are

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,320
there's a large there's a large

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,000
percentage of our society that is

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,520
negatively impacted by the rules that we

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,960
live by then that means it's not working

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,000
and that actually it isn't a proper

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,279
society and so

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,279
we're all responsible for it and we

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,600
can't keep on deferring

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,279
yeah you need to go vote if you can when

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,039
we defer and when we ignore

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,520
what we're doing is asking people who

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,399
are suffering from those black problems

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,120
to suffer alone and that's really uh

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,480
crappy

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,000
like suffering with a problem that no

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,039
one tries to understand is like one of

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
the worst things

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,559
so don't don't leave those people in the

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,520
dark let's make this part of the

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,440
conversation

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,520
make it make it okay to talk about it on

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,679
your team because that's what makes your

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,399
team a psychologically safe place

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,520
to be black or to be you and i think

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,960
that's really important

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,720
and once we have more people at the

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,080
table then maybe we can answer that

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,159
first question of like what does the

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,240
solution actually look like once we have

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,519
a better group

00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,760
that can actually come up with good

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,640
ideas then i think we'll be in a much

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,320
better place

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,279
i also think one really quick example

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,799
it's like you know when people are

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,159
asking like oh let's improve our

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,200
diversity numbers and just like they're

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,240
only thinking about women's like oh ask

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,760
the woman to come up with ideas it's

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,200
like come on dudes like come on like

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,720
everyone like we're all responsible for

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,480
this it's like it's not

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,440
meant to be deferred to the person who's

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,799
ordering that position because they

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,960
already have a lot work to do totally

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,080
all right so this is a great talk thank

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,760
you all for oh

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,200
claire did you want to come in go ahead

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,120
i think um i think you used the word

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,480
intentional earlier and i think that's

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,159
that's exactly right we have to be

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,240
intentional about it

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,840
and take time out to educate ourselves

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
about it about what we can do what we

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,039
can try

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,559
and so actually tomorrow with juneteenth

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,720
i think that's a really great

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,720
great time to take take time out cancel

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,039
some meetings and and go

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,000
read a book watch a documentary things

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,000
like that we're actually doing

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,320
that across amazon tomorrow which is um

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,600
it's wild we're having a full day of you

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,760
know no meetings

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,880
go educate yourself learn take a

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,799
workshop things like that

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,760
i think that's a great way to just you

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,919
know take some time to do it schedule it

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,799
yeah that's a really great point and

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,799
also

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,840
psa dear white people doesn't count

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,760
because it's too good

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,960
so you can watch that on your off hours

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,679
and read a book

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,279
during that time thank you thank you all

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,399
so much and there was one question that

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,679
came up in the chat

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,440
that i would like you to tweet about

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,320

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,200
panelists

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,519
so someone asks safety is good and all

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,360
but

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,279
do you have any tips for actually

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,640
getting leadership to invest in it and

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,039
pay attention to it

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,799

safety please share because we want to
