Title: Serializing your culture with Kelsey Hightower @ Spinnaker.Live
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: Spinnaker.Live 2020
Description: 
	Sit down with Kelsey Hightower and Rosalind Benoit to discuss culture and collaboration in the software development and delivery life cycle. How can we leverage a platform like Spinnaker to treat security and compliance as part of the whole SDLC? Hear Kelsey talk about his personal experience with continuous delivery tools versus platforms, and understand why he focuses so much on culture in his work with Kubernetes and cloud adoption.

	00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:10,720
oh my gosh it's Kelsey Kelsey is on the

00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,880
call are you here am i I'm here

00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,699
alright so let's kick off our first our

00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,339
first content session of the day with

00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:22,819
the one and only but Kelsey Hightower so

00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:25,609
this set this this talk or this chat is

00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:28,029
called serializing culture with Kelsey

00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:30,710
Hightower so let's start by asking

00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:34,340
Kelsey when you say serializing culture

00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,020
what do you mean by that yeah so we sent

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,000
a video I think yesterday we shared a

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,030
link to much broader talk on the subject

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,310
but when it comes to this whole CIC

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,840
dspace a lot of companies believe that

00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,180
they're just like this is either their

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,430
path to innovation or it's this big

00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,560
complicated process or they're looking

00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,090
for best practices from other people

00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,280
right how does Netflix deploy their

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,410
software how to startup X deploy their

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,020
software so when I say serializing

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,610
culture every company has a way of doing

00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,980
things their process whether that's

00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,540
manually following a bill guide but the

00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,460
whole point of sterilizing your cotry is

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,619
once you understand how things work at

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,090
your company most of these tools are

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:13,399
just that right they're just tools and

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,689
your goal is really to try to take all

00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:17,090
the steps or whatever process you

00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:19,340
currently have and then just try to

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,600
articulate it in the tool so serialize

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,429
it if you will just like we do with

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,229
protocols on the wire and once they're

00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:27,280
serialized and they can be automated

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,280
through these various tools

00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,619
i muted what's driving your excitement

00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,450
around kind of shifting to that approach

00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,130
now or is that a shift this is something

00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,960
that you've always done like what's

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,939
changed in the industry that makes us

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,850
ready for this evolution maybe you've

00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:47,049
always been ready but yes I think a lot

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,850
of the people been already some people

00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:52,390
have been ready for 15 years you know I

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,189
think a lot of the platforms have a more

00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,500
opinionated approach so if you're in the

00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:58,780
service space there's a very clean

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,179
opinionated set of api's of how you get

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,030
your app onto a service platform like

00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:05,739
lambda cloud run or Heroku all of those

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,410
service kind of platforms are and

00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:10,239
essentially like hey here's exactly what

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,610
you do so it's so detailed that you

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,930
don't have to do a lot of discovery work

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,910
even for people coming in from like the

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,549
VM world right all cloud providers now

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,410
have really clean api's about what it

00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:21,819
takes to spin up a virtual machine and

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,980
then of course you can use your

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,590
traditional tools and then kubernetes is

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,049
like the biggest milestone in the last

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,720
five years or so where it's opinionated

00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:34,390
about long-running workloads machine

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,790
learning workloads so now the last mile

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,980
the tail end of your pipeline the deploy

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,780
target I think it's so much easier to

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,760
deal with now than what we were doing

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,040
before is why I think there's a renewed

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,730
set of energy and excitement around

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,180
actually finally getting this done

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,989
that makes sense that makes sense um I

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,660
think so on that just thinking about how

00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,010
thinking about that last mile you call

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,569
it the last mile and one of the things

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,270
that comes up for me when we talk about

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,220
last mile is security because security

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,080
is something that often is thought of

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,150
during that last mile or thought up

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,060
that's like our gate to be able to go to

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,130
that last mile deployment story so we

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,459
hear a lot about dev Sec ops that's a

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,380
big buzzword right now to me it means

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,970
we're making security engineers fully

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,709
part of the software delivery

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,810
collaboration but there's definitely

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,640
tension there between dev ops and

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,220
security practitioners so I'd like to

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,410
know how do you see the dev Sec ops

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,450
movement impacting the software delivery

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,180
process like have you seen increased

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,470
collaboration speed up the SDLC or

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,069
what's your view on that on

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,040
collaboration in dedsec ops yeah I'm not

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:48,510
particularly excited about the buzzword

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,330
nonsense to me marketing ops is like you

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,799
what are you talking about people have

00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,450
been involved in the process whether

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
they like it or not if you write code

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,870
you're part of the security story

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,090
whether you like it or not you pull any

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,980
code you write there's a liability so

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,600
you're part of the discussion or not now

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,760
what do you want to be explicit about it

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,670
is a different ideal so when I think

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
about CI CD that pipeline is really for

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,489
what it's designed to just build

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,109
artifacts produce artifacts and get them

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,090
to where they need to go but like the

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:17,070
network underneath that those things are

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,380
always constant they're not like part of

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,450
this pipeline so security attackers

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,370
aren't waiting for your next release no

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,470
one's like oh you have a new release let

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,360
me go and you know see what I can do now

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,740
like it's a constant stream so it's just

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,140
a constant practice so networking

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,120
there's a constant flow of bits and then

00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,520
on the security in there's a constant

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,830
flow of what can people do who are they

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,590
and there's the software working

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,419
correctly and this is true after the

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,070
deployment it's going to be true after

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,200
you turn the lights off and go home for

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,000
the day so to me that layer there's

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,880
about being intentional so what people

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,280
are trying to do now is describe their

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,600
security posture in a simpler way like

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,060
serializing it whether you're using a

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,090
tool like Opa Opa for those familiar

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,560
with the open source project and this is

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,720
where people now are starting to use the

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,000
formal ways of describing their

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,190
authorization policies up and down the

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,320
stack so now that we're adding policies

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,270
not just to our firewalls not just to

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,860
our networking pieces but even to the

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,960
applications and once we have that

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,680
policy I guess given the rise of things

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,650
like the service mesh sto linker D envoy

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,680
all of those tools they all allow us to

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,060
express security in terms of policy so I

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,080
think a lot of companies now are saying

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,610
hey let's operationalize how we think

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,500
about security let's be a little bit

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,300
more intentional and maybe we treat

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,430
security like we do software there's

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,040
artifacts that are produced we have to

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,680
monitor using modern tools to see what

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,660
the activity is and they respond based

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,330
on the actual data all right so I think

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,070
it's just more formalization but less so

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,440
of like oh now that we have this new

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,330
buzzword more people are now doing it

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,300
correctly like I don't I don't subscribe

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,340
to that yeah totally agree with you but

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,130
it sounds like you think that tooling

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,770
like OPA kind of helps create that glue

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,479
that's needed to support DevOps and

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,640
security truly working better together

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,890
just as part of the process like kind of

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,830
us it's like security is now part more

00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,539
part of quality I think in the in the

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:20,190
paradigm that you describe and I think

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:22,470
that's more to be fair myself included

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,710
most people have no idea what they're

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,789
doing when it comes to security at all

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,410
most people have no idea what they're

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:30,270
doing to security at home they buy a

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,910
house they got the locks that it came

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,289
with not many people go and upgrade all

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,510
their locks they just say oh I need

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,220
locks this looks good and most of those

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,840
locks aren't really great at security

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,180
right you can pick them they're like $10

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,370
from Home Depot so it's not like people

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,300
really have any experience with security

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,039
most people aren't security

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,450
professionals same thing is true with

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,740
the applications are you right we go get

00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,960
a certificate because you said I need

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,180
one have no idea what ciphers I'm using

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,160
but I do have that certificate so we

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,020
should be all good and I think what

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,479
happens now is these frameworks and

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,760
tools they are being produced by the

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,380
experts the experts are now making them

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,660
user-friendly just like our standard

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,280
libraries that allow us to do encryption

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,070
right don't roll your own encryption

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,070
sometimes you can but likely now you

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,360
just have so many more tools available

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,490
that are

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,110
meant to be user friendly so I think

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,430
that's where the explosion is coming

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,550
from right oh I could just download

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,860
these tools put them in my workflow and

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,430
now I may have increased my security

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,840
posture as a result I like the way you

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,639
say that I think there's a distinction

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,169
there you say now I can take these tools

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,400
and make them part of my workflow and

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,189
one of the things I've heard you talk

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,689
about before is like what's a good like

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,509
like what is a user-friendly interface

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:44,090
for developers I think for you it's it's

00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:45,830
an API they you you control on the

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,409
security side maybe you control what the

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,819
API is defined as what it looks like and

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,770
you're really strict and opinionated

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,569
about those definitions and then what's

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,699
user-friendly for the developer in that

00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:58,310
in that situation is that then they can

00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,840
go and do whatever they want with that

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,379
within the guardrails that you've set up

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,300
right so it's almost a self-service

00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:07,430
model of collaboration and am i hearing

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,129
that right yeah I think that's right

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:13,250
because the AP no product company nails

00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:15,289
UX end-to-end and when there's a lack of

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,639
UX or there's a lack of workflow

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,879
integration right there's no way to

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,680
integrate with every workflow

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,659
possibility so the thing we can fall

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,159
back on as api's and then tools like

00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,110
kubernetes or vault

00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,599
you name it can sit on top of those

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,000
api's I think security scanning is a

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,890
good example right back in a day used to

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,500
like click on the security scan button

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,760
and then you get a PDF back yeah it's

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,709
like what do I do with this PDF do I

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,180
just email it to a bunch of people so I

00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:42,469
think that's the area where people are

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,510
like you know what we need something

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,000
like structured data so we can actually

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,829
parse the results of the scan and then

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,980
based on those results we can go take

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:53,800
action inside of our live environments

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,050
so that's closing that loop between

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,790
discovering issues and then remediating

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,449
those problems super quick versus

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,200
something that people do quarterly yeah

00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:07,170
got it that makes sense

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,580
all right um I guess we'll go onto this

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,370
one you've said on Twitter that

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,800
kubernetes is a platform for building

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,050
platforms Reggie I think that was years

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,990
ago but it's like you've talked about it

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,430
repeatedly as a starting point and I

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,370
want to know where have you seen folks

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:26,010
get lost in tools or lose focus on that

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,990
platform or the bigger picture and also

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,070
like I guess backing up for a second

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,970
like what's the difference between a

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,620
tool in the platform

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,020
why didn't why does it matter what I

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,200
want to know yeah I think that's a

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,310
really good question for some people

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,570
depending on where you're at like if you

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,580
have a great front door

00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,920
meaning if for the last 10 years your

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,050
developers check in code that code gets

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,850
built and an artifact gets produced and

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,030
then behind the scenes that artifact is

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,980
then pushed out to a deploy target you

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,500
can change the backend from bare metal

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,780
to virtual machines to kubernetes and

00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,160
probably not even change or tell anyone

00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,930
that the front or the back end is

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,170
different because you have a clean front

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,000
door typically though in ops or in

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,370
operations or an infrastructure land

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,620
what we do is we make the thing the tool

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,990
the front door but we have bare metal

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,500
here's your SSH keys we have virtual

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,200
machines

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,000
here's VMware here's AWS here's your

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,460
Google cloud here's a j''r and then

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,890
people start to build workflows directly

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,200
on top of the raw interfaces of the tool

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,280
so when a new tool comes out you get all

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,330
the buzzwords like digital

00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,360
transformation right we're gonna

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,620
transform to the other tool and with

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,660
virtual machines we saw this with like

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,060
vagrant excellent tool hatchet Corp

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,770
built an amazing tool back in a day but

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,020
that was actually kind of part of the

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,510
problem people had a bunch of VMs

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,690
you know a laptop so oh I need 64 gigs

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,490
on my laptop I'm like why do you need 64

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,050
gigs of ram when your laptop is because

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,060
you're trying to run a thousand virtual

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,660
machines and then the tools allow you to

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,070
do that

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,080
and I think is that's what's really

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,570
never the goal that we were leaking the

00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,400
infrastructure details up so when I say

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,170
it's a platform for building platforms

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,940
it just tries to give you this common

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,890
layer at the bottom so that you can

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,450
focus on whatever your front door needs

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,450
to be some people that will look like

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,910
Cloud Foundry App Engine you name it

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,550
those are more suitable for the front

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,590
doors and until we get those we're

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,880
always going to need these platforms for

00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,560
building those platforms

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,000
one platform doesn't solve every

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,730
companies in the world challenges so

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,889
tools like kubernetes exist

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,540
yeah and it sounds like it sounds like

00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:30,540
with that common layer on the bottom

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,100
with that platform layer you have it if

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,930
your because I think like there's a

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,449
there's a big hype cycle around tools

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,889
right we have that as technologists we

00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,170
get excited about tools and you can

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,699
capitalize that on that to get your

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,680
whole company excited about using the

00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:47,279
new tool in the short term but in the

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,589
end that doesn't actually serve that's

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,240
not about your company's story or your

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,560
company's goals or your solving your

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,120
business problems that's about getting

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,110
excited about a tool so I can see what

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,329
you're saying it's like that's not

00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,579
something that you can transfer as

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,990
easily whereas if you create a front

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,310
door that tells the story that you're

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,899
trying to tell that meets the

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,449
requirements that you're trying to meet

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,949
then that that's how that has staying

00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:10,170
power right is that what you're saying

00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:11,610
yeah it may make sense you know if you

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,139
know if you take a group of construction

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,399
workers and they all meet at Home Depot

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,550
they're gonna be like oh man look at

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,470
this new saw look at this new hammer

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,690
look at this new jackhammer oh I got I

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,220
can like build 50 houses with these like

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,079
alright that's pretty dope and they're

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,850
gonna probably talk about hey look at my

00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,620
new tool belt look at its awesome isn't

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,630
it's like oh may I go get that tool belt

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,060
so that kind of makes sense while we

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,860
hear it so much but the thing is though

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,529
a lot of us are supposed to be building

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,589
houses so imagine you buy a nice little

00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,790
pot in a subdivision and you roll up and

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,439
all the construction workers just got

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,509
all their tools laid out like yeah look

00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:47,430
at all these tools man we're about to

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:49,980
adopt a self-service model you can pick

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,550
any of these tools and build whatever

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,139
house you want and your looks like no I

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,630
actually think those are actually cool

00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,759
could you pick them up move please and I

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,430
need my house because all I want you all

00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,959
to do was to build my house like well I

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,790
think every homeowner should know how

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,339
tools work because we're doing like

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,740
house ops and you should know and

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,089
respect the tools that way you'll

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,579
appreciate the house that you live in

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,740
it's like negative I got to go to work

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,569
I got a different job I would like you

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,100
to build a house so I can live in the

00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:22,709
house that's what I want

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,449
abstraction right like that's that's

00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:27,870
kind of what we all want I would say

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:31,110
abstraction service I'm just not trying

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,570
to be a carpenter so I would appreciate

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:36,420
we'll pay you gladly to let me continue

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,010
with that mission gotcha so it sounds

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,959
like the this is something that can help

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,250
us focus on our company's unique

00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,560
strengths and values and like stay

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,600
focused on those there's there's lots

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,550
more I can say about that I do see you

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,769
that we have a few questions coming in

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,589
from our audience so we can start

00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:55,110
looking at those I do see a classic

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:56,670
question which is monoliths versus micro

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,640
services what are what is your choice

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,760
and I those of us who follow Kelsey on

00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,769
Twitter we may know what his

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,209
controversial choice is but you can

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:08,730
speak on that if you'd like tell C and

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,380
I'll look for more questions yeah the

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,820
whole model is versus micro services

00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,589
this is the part where again we're

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,500
taking practice and trying to turn them

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,290
into best practices if you have a model

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,700
with and you don't like it you gotta ask

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,769
yourself why is there a lack of

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,420
engineering culture is there a lack of

00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,670
discipline did things get out of whack

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,920
is the code base just going crazy and

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,079
for some people the next logical step is

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,850
a clean refactor take some time pay back

00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,620
some of that technical debt there's

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,690
going to be extreme cases where it does

00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,860
make maybe not so extreme there's going

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,140
to be cases where you want to do

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,160
something new and you look at that new

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,500
thing you want to do let's say you want

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,180
to add a mobile front end or you want to

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,850
add some integration for like the Google

00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,769
assistant you may not Jam that into the

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,660
existing model if they may make sense to

00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:54,120
just have that become a new piece a new

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,070
component that lives off to the side its

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,110
own deployable maybe even pick a

00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,970
different technology stack and then have

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,949
that little component call back into the

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,410
monoliths see that makes a lot of sense

00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:05,970
what people didn't do think is well

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,010
let's just break up the rest of this

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,050
thing that's working fine paying our

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,730
bills been stable for a hundred years

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,570
because we went to a conference and

00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,519
people say you got to break up

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,170
everything by default I think that's

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,910
when we start to go off the rails so I

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,260
think you're gonna have monoliths for a

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,660
lot of people will make sense as a place

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,820
to start sometimes new functionality

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,230
makes sense to build in isolation if you

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,390
start seeing hotspots meaning there's

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,620
too much latency in the interaction one

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,660
thing you can do from an engineering

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,660
perspective is move it back into the

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,579
monolith no one's gonna talk about you

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,350
bad on Twitter or Facebook or anything

00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,180
right you're gonna be okay but these are

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,920
just tools and architectural patterns

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,540
you can try and if they work for you

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:49,020
roll with them there is no versus

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:51,600
gotcha okay wise wise words do we have

00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:55,200
any other questions cuz I can come up

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,700
with more I want to talk I guess I kind

00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,290
of there's some stuff that we started

00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,820
talking about that we didn't talk about

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,690
too much so I'll wait for another

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:08,250
question but also bumbling Lee asked one

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:11,130
in my way so you talked about how you

00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,110
talked about about experts making some

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,850
of these things user friendly and that's

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,800
kind of part of understanding how things

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,400
work at your company and company and

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,050
then using your expertise to take all

00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,980
the steps that you need to articulate

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:29,279
that culture in your tools and you

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,710
talked about OPA you talked about OPA

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:35,130
and I guess I'm gonna know more about

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:37,230
how like what'swhat's a really powerful

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,910
way to implement that or what's a really

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,650
powerful way to implement that to do

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,300
what we're talking about as far as take

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,150
all the steps in articulate in the tools

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,529
and I'm probably thinking about the I'm

00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,720
probably thinking about the Armory's

00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:50,640
vinegar policy engine when I talk about

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,020
that that's that's what my perspective

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,020
is but I want to know what yours is

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,150
Kelsey we gotta make sure we keep this

00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,650
stuff centered on on people and this is

00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,029
the biggest takeaway no word towards the

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,450
end here so I'm gonna wrap with this I

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:07,350
was watching one of MLK's latest talks

00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:11,040
and he talked about laws can't change

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,870
the hearts of people but laws can limit

00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,720
the damage that heartless people can do

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,400
and when we start thinking about all of

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,309
these tools and when we learn best

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,050
practices when we learn how to do

00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:24,870
something effectively or when we define

00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,660
a policy you can't just assume that

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,610
using open policy agent or spinnaker do

00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,620
your bills and your pipelines or gonna

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,320
make everyone become the very best

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,980
engineer ever but what you can do though

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,330
is take your learning and encode them

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,790
into whatever platform you're putting

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,350
together for your team and you can raise

00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:45,300
awareness through that platform teach

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,390
people hey if you want to get software

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,309
to production in a safe repeatable way

00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,410
we've assembled these tools here's what

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,780
their API czar and maybe through

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,500
learning we've added a small thin layer

00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,880
on top that's our company's platform

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,650
once you have those things in place

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,409
those become the laws those become the

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,150
frameworks of how things get done and

00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:07,760
then what happens is you have this kind

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,190
of happy pass so what I think of this is

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,539
if you're a security professional

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,610
there's a tons of tools now including

00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:17,419
open policy agent that will allow you to

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,460
encode a lot of your expertise into a

00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,260
platform where you won't always be

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,179
needed to make sure things are secured

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,890
by default you can go and kind of push

00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:32,090
those things out if you're on the bill

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:34,130
infrasonic an encode or serialize your

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,870
expertise into your various pipelines

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,669
but remember those things are going to

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,500
be fairly brittle and they're going to

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:42,080
be living they're going to change as you

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,400
learn or as you change things so don't

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,250
try to go and build these kind of

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,570
bulletproof live forever pipelines you

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,950
got to make sure they reflect the

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,630
current state of the company culture

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,630
which should always be evolving and

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,429
changing based on learning

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,530
okay that's really good and before I

00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:59,660
like before I let you go Kelsey we did

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,270
have a great question here that came up

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,500
and it's now gone because the live

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,410
discussion has switched to the next

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:10,520
panel but it was from surge at SAP and

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:12,830
he was asking about how how you deal

00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,750
with cultural differences amongst teams

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,970
and how can you how can you see realized

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:20,240
cultural culture and how can you do

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:22,549
cultural evolution when you have kind of

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,690
a diverse cultures amongst teams so

00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:25,549
that's something that we would really

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,140
love to hear you tweet about today with

00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:29,330
hashtag spinnaker live so that we can

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,039
continue the conversation I know surge

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,840
is a really important part of the

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,539
spinnaker community so I want to hear

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,710
your thoughts on that when you have time

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:39,020
thank you so much for taking the time to

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:42,429
talk to us today Kelsey awesome bye

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,429
