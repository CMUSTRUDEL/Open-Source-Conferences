Playlist: Spinnaker.Live 2020
Description: 
	As in most enterprises with multiple platforms and large infrastructures, Adobe aims to provide a unified integrated platform for performing continuous deployments. In Adobe Experience Platform we've chosen to build an entire deployment ecosystem on top of Spinnaker which was suited for most of our scenarios. The presentation will tackle complex scenarios in which we use Spinnaker to leverage CI/CD pipelines. Iulian Titiriga and Dan Popescu will go through each of these scenarios and explain their role in the whole automation ecosystem.
