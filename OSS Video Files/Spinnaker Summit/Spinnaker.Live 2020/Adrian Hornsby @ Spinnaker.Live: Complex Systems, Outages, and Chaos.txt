Title: Adrian Hornsby @ Spinnaker.Live: Complex Systems, Outages, and Chaos
Publication date: 2020-06-22
Playlist: Spinnaker.Live 2020
Description: 
	Failures are inevitable. Regardless of the engineering efforts put into building resilient applications and handling edge cases, one day, a case beyond our reach will turn a benign failure into a catastrophic outage. In this talk, I discuss practices teams can use to design applications for resiliency, and share some lessons learned, often the hard way, to prepare and recover faster from outages.

thanks a lot first of all sex a lot for

00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:10,590
inviting me and I hope you had a good

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,510
day I've been actually following any of

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,599
the talks and I have to say it's been

00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,189
for me a fantastic experience some great

00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,390
some great speakers and actually

00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:20,999
fantastic

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,339
chat discussions as well and talking

00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:26,509
about chat I've been I've been told that

00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,839
we are giving away five copies of

00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:30,630
CloudFormation

00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:32,759
on AWS so if you're really active on the

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,300
chat and you ask questions will be

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,670
giving some copies so feel free to to be

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,289
active so today I'm going to talk a

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,399
little bit about a complex system

00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:47,609
outages and chaos and before before

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,699
actually starting I want to ask you a

00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:54,019
question do you want to lose a hundred

00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:57,059
thousand dollars so if you do please

00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:59,690
tell your name on the chat because I'll

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,579
be I'd be surprised you want right so

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,159
why I'm asking the question is it's

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,290
because that's the average price of one

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,290
hour of downtime actually and that's

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:14,939
okay

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,130
okay so and I don't want to lose

00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,619
$100,000 so okay cool so at least you

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,780
heard me I talked about the $100,000 so

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,920
yeah so that's the average time of one

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,020
hour of downtime so I guess a lot of of

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,259
what we need to do is trying to about

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,929
that and that brings me to to talk about

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,399
it will be the bility of complex systems

00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:45,299
and distributed systems and actually

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,640
systems in general and we calculate the

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,289
availability by the normal operation

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,520
time divided by the total time of

00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:56,250
operation or by the time at the time

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,099
that it takes between failures divided

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,509
by the time between failures past the

00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:05,969
time to recover and that gives us one

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,489
very important information is actually

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,190
if we want to have a maximum

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:15,599
availability well we need to add MTTR

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,150
close to zero so that we can add 1 over

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,950
1 which then will give us close to

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:25,319
hundred percent so that gives me an

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,450
important thing to think about and MTTR

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,209
is very important during an outage right

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,450
so if we look at the anatomy of an

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,519
outage we typically have something like

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,470
this right we have the time we have a

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,500
failure and then there is the moment of

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,919
detection evaluation response hopefully

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,530
a response some recovery a confirmation

00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:49,739
that things are good and then eventually

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,470
in all clear of course each of those

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,720
phase is very different between outage

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,049
you can have very long detection

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,750
sometimes a very fast very fast response

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:04,400
or very long one all right so the point

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,200
here is I want to draw the curve of

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,790
stress and that's human stress related

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,879
to this and as you can see the the

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,269
stress level goes very very fast as soon

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,760
as we have a detection that means like

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:24,150
okay we know we have an outage and

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,669
eventually it stays up until the

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,160
all-clear but actually in many companies

00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:33,600
that I've worked with or

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,180
operated in sometimes at all clear then

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,330
this stress level goes back up and

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,390
usually that's because we have companies

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:46,470
that I have blaming blaming cultures and

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:48,960
then we are scared of being fired so the

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,150
early days of my career I remember that

00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,880
I had a very big outage and I was not

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:58,200
trained to recover from outages and I

00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:02,970
had and it was Sunday afternoon a very

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,370
terrible terrible outage several hours

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,030
down and like the whole company starting

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,930
to fall apart

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,730
everyone started to yell and you know

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,950
ended up actually creating even more

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,310
problem and deleting a database in

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:20,280
production so it took even longer to

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,470
recover and I can tell you at the end

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,450
my stress level when we all recovered

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,610
actually didn't go down it actually went

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,560
up because I was really wondering what

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,650
was going to happen to me but luckily my

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,740
manager never ever pointed the finger to

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:38,730
me and instead asked me what we can do

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:41,910
to not repeat this ever again so for me

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:45,600
this is a very important lesson and from

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:48,150
from the outage actually we can then

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,550
deduct what we call the time to recover

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,650
and of course time to recover is very

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,140
important because the faster you recover

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,750
the more available you are for your

00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,380
customers and the more available the

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,000
less you're gonna have customer churn so

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,510
if we think a little bit about MTTR

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,130
there is actually quite a big problem

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,800
with that metric and I want to address

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,780
this so if I give you this slide and I

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,790
ask you which of the best of the two

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,940
company is the best you probably would

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,700
tell me well of course MTTR is best for

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,700
company number two because it's it's

00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:28,250
lesser but if I add this information

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:31,950
into in into the picture things start to

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,090
get a little bit more messy because now

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:39,360
we have the same company that add a low

00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,780
MTTR but has 33 outages per month and if

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,860
you cumulate the number of hours it's

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:50,580
what worse right so here MTTR is indeed

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:53,490
lower but actually company number two of

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,430
obviously as much bigger operational

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,580
problems so when we think about entity

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,950
are is very important to understand what

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,310
we're talking about the mean part of

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:08,190
MTTR is actually the problem so if you

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,370
if you think about entity are a system

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,860
wide it really gonna be a problem what

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,950
we want is to think about it in terms of

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,930
different class and type of outages it's

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,200
also very important to set some recovery

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,490
target time so that we can then include

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,350
this into the MTTR document right and

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,210
eventually also a included total number

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:34,260
of incidents and community instant in

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,050
time okay so now we've deal with the

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,300
time to recover we understand the

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,020
problems of the mean and we classify

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,330
them so how do we actually improve the

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:50,820
time to recover and typically there are

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:54,560
four four areas of work you can design

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:58,320
your system for resiliency you can

00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,710
detect better you can recover faster

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:05,039
or and also continuously improve and

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:08,130
this is very important that we look into

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,830
all of this so the first one is designed

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,770
for resiliency and and one of the the

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,690
big problem I see is when people talk

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,700
about complex system they automatically

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,419
think about the Amazon between er the

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,710
Netflix yeah there's like hundreds of

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,660
sometimes thousands of micro services

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,539
and indeed those are really complex

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:32,340
distributed systems but actually this

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:34,800
simple client network server diagram is

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,900
also a complex systems because there are

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,910
a lot of places here that can go wrong

00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,950
right your client sends a message to the

00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,710
network then the network passes it to

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,270
the server the server replies and then

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,950
the network replies to the client and

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,320
not each of those steps you can have

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:52,110
some errors and typically you actually

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,450
often can have these errors and this is

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,180
why we have a different type of network

00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,580
error latency Eric

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,900
or sometimes also packet loss so I mean

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,789
inherently all the systems are complex

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,560
it's not doesn't have to be distributed

00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:11,039
the monoliths are actually also very

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,160
complex systems so when we talk about

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,610
building for resiliency it doesn't

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,620
necessarily have to to to think very far

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,870
in terms of distributed systems because

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,789
I'm pretty sure if I asked you in the

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,250
audience how many of you have had a

00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:28,110
certificate expiration type of outage

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,020
I'm sure a lot of you are gonna raise

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:36,150
ends and the same how many of you have

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:41,209
had outages that were due to deployments

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:45,750
right so this is this is the kind of

00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:48,540
kind of readiness least very very simple

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,520
one but it's just to give you so some

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,680
things to think about when we design for

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,350
resiliency and then there's something

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,290
else as well like you can't infinitely

00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:01,680
design for resiliency because it's it's

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:04,080
really it's hard like maybe at the

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,110
beginning you get a lot of box for you

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,730
or for your work but eventually you're

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,660
really gonna have to invest a lot of

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,640
time to get closer to the two to the

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,550
four or five nines of availability right

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,060
so it's not proportional it's actually

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,330
the the work is exponential in terms of

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,550
need to to get your own lines of ability

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,709
then there's another thing that we start

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,279
to talk about as well is and actually

00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:34,830
many many people have talked about in

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,959
the presentation and this is what we

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,660
call partial failure mode and I think

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,959
this is it is the best the best video

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:46,500
I've found to explain the thing is okay

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,209
you have a system but instead of having

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,620
a binary system that works so doesn't

00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,080
work you want to have some graceful

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:57,360
degradation and this is totally part of

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,820
resiliency and you know how you can

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,580
design a system that accept failures

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:06,120
because you know failures happen all the

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,380
time if you don't embrace failure and if

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,080
you don't think about failure as a

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,149
first-class citizen

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,120
basically you're gonna have bad

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,920
surprises so thinking about partial

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,250
failure mode and especially how you're

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,050
going to degrade hopefully gracefully is

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:27,170
something that is also very important

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:28,970
when you are building resilient system

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,399
most of the time people think about a

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,160
first infrastructure Network data and

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,529
application layer but actually there's a

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,209
lot of things to think about as well in

00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,589
terms of resiliency in terms of

00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,050
operation and we talked about the

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,300
deployment but we also think about rail

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,370
guards and you know how do you actually

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:51,709
operate safely in the system how can you

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,920
make sure that you know when you are

00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:57,620
operating in production you don't run a

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,079
drop table in in production like I did

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,850
so I didn't have the right at the right

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,640
environment I didn't right I have the

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,170
right tools or the right notice and I

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,920
could do things that were actually very

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,740
dangerous and finally it is also

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,230
thinking about people because I work our

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,140
work with a lot of teams where there is

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,550
this hero in the team that knows pretty

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,980
much everything that's been in the

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,320
company for long and he has secret

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,140
sources that sometimes doesn't he

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,410
doesn't share with your company so this

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,870
is what I wanted to do to really make

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,029
sure that when we think and talk about

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:37,490
resiliency we don't only talk about the

00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:43,430
technology but really also about how

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:47,300
people think and operate safely the

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,160
second part of improving MTTR is of

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,430
course detecting better and to detect

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,910
better I've never found anything better

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,949
than find a way for any developer in the

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,410
company to actually only write one line

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:03,100
of code to be able to do any tracing

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:06,079
measuring and actually graph something

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,440
if it's more complicated for a developer

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,300
generally they want to it if you really

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,190
have to import a lot of things right a

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,070
lot of codes to start measuring a

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,529
particular metric usually people come to

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:21,440
it so if you make it easy and invest in

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,850
making easy generally you're gonna have

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,990
good metric and good metric

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:29,180
means that you detect better I don't

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,740
know I I don't count anymore how many

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,380
outages I've had that didn't have the

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,319
right alarm or we were not measuring the

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,579
length of the queue or the latency on

00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:45,290
the particular database or something

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:48,019
like this so the main problem is it just

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,540
was not easy enough for people to to

00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:53,389
write those metrics and also when you

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,130
start looking into debugging things I

00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:56,959
and you start to want to put some

00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,310
metrics in place and instrument your

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:04,670
code make it as as easy as possible I've

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,860
talked about alarms I mean if you don't

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,490
have the right unarmed generally you

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:13,699
will not detect so we do this for fire

00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:15,860
alarms in the home so this is something

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:17,509
that you really really need to focus on

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,319
as well and and test your alarms

00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:25,490
regularly never assume that your learn

00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:27,889
work if you assume something and if you

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:31,310
haven't verified regularly that your

00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:33,709
alarm system is working assume it's

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,209
broken and that's the same for backups

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:38,480
by the way I think a lot of people

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:40,579
assume to have backups but a backup is

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,889
only valid really when you have proven

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:46,790
that you can recover safely out of it

00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:48,709
and the third part is recovering faster

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,380
and to recover faster I want to take an

00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:53,600
example of of firefighters a

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,139
firefighters spent approximately 80% of

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,699
the time to practice going into fire and

00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:00,500
they do this to really build an

00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:03,380
intuition an intuition so they don't

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,899
have to think when they go and fight a

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,360
fire and I can ask you as well

00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,759
i meani of you have practiced recovering

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,920
from an outage in the last week or in

00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,750
the last month if you haven't done in

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,360
the last months you're gonna have skill

00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:21,920
atrophy that means you not going to be

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:25,839
very very skilled or fluent with with

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:31,010
different tools and common line Linux

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:34,800
tools to to to do your your debugging

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:38,490
and to do the inspection of the problem

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:42,000
in the outage right in the early 2000 we

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,339
actually hired a firefighter at the

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,830
Volunteer 500 called Jesse Robbins who

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:49,800
prepared what we call the game day at

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,890
Amazon and a game day was already in the

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,480
early 2000 a moment where we would

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,940
practice actually a recovering from

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,750
outage so what do you typically would go

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,899
you go around the data centers and

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,540
unplug things or inject faults and that

00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:10,350
was really to improve the resiliency but

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,930
also the incidence response of this team

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,060
it was a master of disaster I think it's

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,720
probably a live goal once you achieve

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:22,220
this it's pretty cool and then we come

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,220
to chaos engineering there was you know

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,580
very interesting talk earlier today from

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,440
Netflix around chaos engineering so I I

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,870
don't want to deep dive too much into it

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,820
but chaos engineering is a scientific

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,490
method and you know it's it's a way to

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,240
experiment on the system where you make

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,520
an iPod face and you go into trying to

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,020
prove or disprove this hypothesis it's

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,580
like for example can I can my system

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,400
still operate without a master database

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,250
can we actually turn into a read-only

00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:00,750
mode this is the kind of activities you

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:03,660
would go into into trying to prove or

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,700
disprove in the system and what is very

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,100
important with scales engineering is of

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,750
course people will think it should be it

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,339
should be done in production and the

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,440
goal is eventually to be done in

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,080
production but what is very important is

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,720
to start the journey

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:21,420
you can't start in production so you

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,070
really have to learn to do it in your

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,660
local environment get comfortable with

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,190
the tools it's all about building

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,570
confidence right and I've never seen

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,550
anyone get confidence by starting in

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,010
production so even though I usually

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,230
don't make friends when I say like start

00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,910
chaos engineering outside of production

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,310
but I think and and I've seen with

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,980
customers it's really really the safest

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,779
way to do this and eventually it has the

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,210
team's build confidence in their

00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:51,000
capacity to recover

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,520
to identify mistakes in a live

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,800
production environment definitely it's

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,350
something that will eventually move to

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,310
production and we do kiss engineering

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,819
really to avoid having weaknesses appear

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:08,010
in production at 3:00 a.m. or during

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:13,920
during Christmas and birthdays and these

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:15,630
are outages that I've had many appearing

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,890
during this time if you want to read

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,870
more about chaos engineering actually

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,280
Netflix publish probably the best book

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:26,880
around that there's a link in the slide

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,980
so go have a parade definitely and the

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,600
good thing is actually spinnaker does

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,580
integrate very well with guest

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,860
engineering and with another concept

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,679
which in my opinion is very important

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:40,290
when you want to learn how to recover

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,200
fast is the concept of immutable

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:46,350
infrastructure where instead of doing

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,080
replacement in place you actually do a

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,870
replacement using a canary pattern that

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:57,059
same canary pattern is actually used to

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:59,520
to do safety safe experiment for for

00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,320
chaos engineering so if you're using

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,190
spinnaker if you're interested into case

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:09,270
engineering spinnaker death support

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:11,790
canary patterns so definitely also try

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:16,650
to embrace and and look at it because

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:23,760
it's really really helps with your with

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:24,330
your recovery okay yeah we got the

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,710
wrap-up here

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,270
Adrian and I have a note on the

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,190
questions but keep going I'll let you

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,700
let you wrap up because we want to hear

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:36,660
this okay yeah I've tried to two minute

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:40,910
is okay sure sorry about that

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:43,350
so in terms of continuous improvement

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,450
spend a lot of time on your poor smarter

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,600
we talked a little bit about spoke

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,929
aluminum today what is very important is

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,360
that there is actually no isolated cause

00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:56,160
of accident it's usually what I see the

00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,890
best the most common mistake is people

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,350
find one cause and then they stop

00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,919
they're actually they are causes

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,750
mainly causes for an accident so try to

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:08,820
investigate these and especially

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,640
especially don't stop at the operator

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,860
don't stop at the person because

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,410
everyone as good intention you don't

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,620
come to work with thinking today you're

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:22,429
gonna do a really bad job so if you stop

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,010
and you find yourself blaming someone

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,960
it's more because you have some biases

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:31,590
that you need to go through so when you

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,840
try to look at causes of an accident I

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,260
always suggest to look into three areas

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,460
the culture the processes and the tools

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,240
right and this is really really

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,970
important for you to to do that and

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,070
finally my lesson learned and this is

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,679
not technology lesson notes and I have I

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:53,250
really have to that I want to to give

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,890
you some suggestions to for you to go

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,780
and and learn more about it it's called

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,830
the normalization of deviance and this

00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,539
is stuff we do regularly that if you

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,210
would go and visit another company and

00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:08,789
the team you probably would find very

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:12,240
dangerous but because we've done it for

00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:16,429
many years we get really used to it and

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,929
these are usually things that eventually

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:21,929
turn into an outage you know like

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:24,990
logging into a live production system

00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:29,220
using SSH these kind of things without

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:31,110
you know it might be stuff that we do if

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,440
we've done successfully for years but

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:37,350
this is exactly what the problem is it's

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,419
become normal and and we we don't treat

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,419
it as something that actually can be

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:45,260
very dangerous and then watch out for

00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:47,789
Bureau six list on cost fallacy

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,409
confirmation by us and of course my

00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,380
favorite one the fundamental attribution

00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:54,990
errors which is often the problem that

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,480
is used in post-mortem to to blame

00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:01,289
people so have a look at those and and

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,750
remember that technology really never

00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:06,750
ever makes any system resilient is

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,630
really the people around the team that

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:13,020
does so shift the focus from technology

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,810
to people and Trust and enable the

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,240
people

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:19,060
and then I can I can assure you you'll

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,890
be successful and thank you very much

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:25,060
for your time and I'm so sorry that I

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:27,070
took more time no no no it's so good to

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,840
have you Adrian and I have already

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,300
volunteered you to do something else for

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,490
us because of this I got there were some

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,690
great questions in the chat and I

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,430
recorded them all before they

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,460
disappeared so what I would like to do

00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,500
is invite you to join me on an episode

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:44,410
