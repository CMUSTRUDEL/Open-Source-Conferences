and Spinnaker's success is in large part

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,769
due to the amazing community of

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,869
into this ecosystem which equals

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,550
innovation both for Netflix but also for

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,219

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,700
from within the community to build a

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:48,149

anyone in the community can get involved

00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,250
we're trying to be very much inclusive

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,080
but at the end of the day for me

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,910
community really is all about innovation

00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,460
and the more healthy and engaged

00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,610
community is like the more everyone gets

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,390
