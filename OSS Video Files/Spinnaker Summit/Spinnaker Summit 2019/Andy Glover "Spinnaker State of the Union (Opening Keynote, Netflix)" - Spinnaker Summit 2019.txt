proposal we received myriad excellent

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,150
proposals and it was hard to narrow the

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,790
field down to this year's lineup this

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,330
summit is an incredible event that takes

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,100

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,550
everyone here

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:23,550
so last year when I spoke I was excited

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,260
to announce that both Netflix and Google

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,060
had worked together and set up a

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,150
governance policy for spinnaker that

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,400
formalized a steering committee a

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,010
technical oversight committee the notion

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,890
of special interest groups and created

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,190
roles for the community for community

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:46,110
members such as reviewer and approver

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:48,270
and I'm elated to let you know that

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,490
since last year's summit the community

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,070
has begun a series of special interest

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,310
groups or SIG's there is a kubernetes

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,110
sig there is an AWS focus sig there's a

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,270
security sig and as I already mentioned

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,600
there is a spinnaker summit sig and

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:06,750
there are more these SIG's have been

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,720
proposed by the community and are led by

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,790
the community so thank you to all the

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:19,680
sig leads and to everyone who

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:22,020
participates I think oh we're almost

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,700
done with the clapping so since

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,530
releasing the initial version of the

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,590
governance policy we've taken steps to

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,930
clarify aspects of it and even moved all

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,840
of our governance documents to github

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,340
and formalized a transparent process of

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,220
modifying it through pull requests and

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:45,300
votes via or votes from committee

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,550
members the technical oversight

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,240
committee and steering committee meeting

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,580
agendas are open to view and the TOC has

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,860
begun experimenting with open office

00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,200
hours for anyone to join in ask

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:03,330
questions or simply just listen in and

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,640
I'm thrilled to announce that last month

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,510
Ethan Rogers from armoury joined the

00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,510
technical Oversight Committee

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,680

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,830

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,290
and Rob Zeenat from Netflix and Michael

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:30,940
plumpie and Erik Zamani from Google on

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:33,590
the technical Oversight Committee and

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,290
this is super exciting and this echos

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,540
the increase of stir the increase of

00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,400
strong invested collaborators from

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,270
within the community that are becoming

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,330
approvers and reviewers this past year

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,920
alone we had 202 new contributors to the

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:53,150
spinnaker ecosystem that's on top of

00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:56,300
like 2,000 2,000 plus contributors

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,860
already and this is a fabulous trend and

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,770
I have every expectation that we'll see

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,480
more of it throughout 2020 and so in

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,370
other exciting news earlier this year

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,880
spinnaker joined the continuous delivery

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,100
foundation the CDF is a neutral

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,620
organization that will grow and sustain

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,200
an open source continuous delivery

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,780
ecosystem much like the cloud native

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,640
computing foundation or CN CF has done

00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:28,250
for the cloud native computing ecosystem

00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,870
spinnaker is joined in the cdf with

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,670
jenkins Tecton and Jenkins X and

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,370
spinnaker success is in large part due

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,800
to the amazing community of companies

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,000
and people that use it and contribute to

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:47,080
it donating spinnaker to the CDF has

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,030
strengthened this community this move

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,950
encourages contributions and investments

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,810
from additional companies who have

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,900
undoubtedly been waiting on the

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,540
sidelines opening the doors to new

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,830
companies increases innovation will see

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:05,720
in spinnaker which benefits all of us

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,170
donating spinnaker to the CDF doesn't

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,990
change

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,510
Netflix's commitment to spinnaker and

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,840
what's more current users of spinnaker

00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:17,000
have been unaffected by this change and

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,310
without a doubt over time new

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,160
stakeholders will emerge and play a

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:25,670
larger more formal role in shaping

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,620
Spinnaker's future the prospects of an

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,540
even healthier and more engaged

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,970
community focused on spinnaker and the

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,330
manifold benefits of continuous delivery

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:37,099
is extremely exciting and I'm looking

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,610
forward to seeing spinnaker and this

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,349
ecosystem continued to flourish so in

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,750
addition to enhancing Spinnaker's

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:46,880
governance policy and donating spinnaker

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:50,090
to a neutral foundation there has been

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,570
considerable innovation from many of the

00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,280
people and companies here tonight

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,030
the spinnaker ecosystem is flourishing

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,560
and because of it we're all benefiting

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:03,560
so when it comes to kubernetes three

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,670
major new features over the last year is

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,890
the addition of customized dynamic

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,900
account creation for both kubernetes and

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,030
Cloud Foundry and then enhanced traffic

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,370
management that will facilitate

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,770
deployment patterns such as Bluegreen

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,160
deployments there's been considerable

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:28,580
work to add secrets management support

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,590
and despair occur and there's been

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:34,700
changes and enhancements to the

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:39,200
authorization model and the spinnaker

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,990
now supports Google cloud built on the

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,840
AWS cloud provider side there's been a

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:48,110
lot of enhancements to the ECS provider

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:51,110
and I'm really excited to let everyone

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:55,310
know that fairly recently Lambda support

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,320
has been added into spinnaker new

00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,290
triggers have been added so we now

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,870
support Nexus and artifactory and those

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,750
now you can trigger pipelines off events

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:09,020
there and there's a new service called

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,850
swabby which will allow you to clean up

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,860
your infrastructure and you can you can

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,580
plug in various rules for cleaning up

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,320
whatever you see fit and and a

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,870
considerable investment has been made

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,000
into a number of our services to allow

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,830
you to back it with a sequel based data

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,400
store this allows you to obviously

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,740
replace Redis if you see fit to do so on

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,640
the automated canary analysis side

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,200
there's new data sources for signal FX

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,680
and

00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,570
New Relic there has been a ton of

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,760
investment from within the community to

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:49,280
build a viable plug-in system for

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:52,070
spinnaker and cloud driver now supports

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:57,500
idempotency through the notion of sagas

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:59,120
where are you so I'd like to call out

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,380
while spinnaker is an open source

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,380
project

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,790
there's commute commercial innovation

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,610
happening in and around the ecosystem

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,650
there are companies like armory and op

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,110
some ex squarely focused on spinnaker

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,490
but there are also other companies

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:17,840
building interesting features and

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:20,180
add-ons one such company is gremlin for

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,820
those of you who aren't aware gremlin

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,100
makes a product that unleashes chaos so

00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,530
that you can take test your applications

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,710
reliability as part of a software

00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,060
delivery process and this is pretty neat

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,530
because this mirrors a lot of the

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,250
innovations that we've done within

00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,310
Netflix

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:40,310
as I'm sure everyone in this room is

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,110
well aware we have built myriad tools

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,690
that help teams ensure reliability

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,730
including chaos monkey which at any

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,370
given moment is killing off healthy

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,770
instances to ensure services and their

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,140
owners aren't surprised chaos monkey

00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,210
comes for free and spinnaker and in fact

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,810
one of the core developers is here with

00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:02,330
us this weekend we've integrated our

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,730
chaos automation platform known as chap

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:08,510
into spinnaker this allows you to run

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:11,030
chaos experiments during delivery and

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,130
we've added squeeze testing so you can

00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:16,370
better determine scaling policies for

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:19,250
example so as you can see 2019 has been

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,790
amazing for spinnaker and I have no

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,930
doubt that 2020 will be even better

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,990
we've been working as a community to

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,000
better understand the various needs of

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:31,400
stakeholders and the initiatives

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,350
spearheaded by them and we have an

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,070
initial broadly focused roadmap

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,380
available on our community repos so if

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:42,530
you go to the spinnaker org there's a

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,290
community github repository this is

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,830
undoubtedly a living document and we'd

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,520
love your feedback

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,870
obviously we want your input as well so

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,090
I want to take a step and talk about

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,080
innovation specifically as it pertains

00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,880
the Netflix the V the the needs of

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,340
various teams that Netflix has resulted

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,590
in powerful extensions within spinnaker

00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,950
that enable not only rapid and reliable

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:12,250
delivery to AWS but also Akamai and our

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,780
own container cloud Titus but the

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,180
innovations don't stop there

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,250
spinnaker has also been extended to

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,080
facilitate delivery of firmware updates

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,290
to our global fleet of open connect

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,900
appliances spinnaker also enables the

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,090
safe manipulation of feature flags

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,770
what's more spinnaker enables the

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,550
delivery and management of libraries

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,700
across the Netflix infrastructure but at

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:41,650
Netflix we are in the midst of another

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:45,130
big leap our company continues to grow

00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:48,160
in terms of employees but also it in

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,350
terms of subscribers and this is

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,560
resulting in our infrastructure growing

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:56,470
as well and this is resulting in a

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,470
rising of complexity both for

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:03,370
application owners and the centralized

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:05,770
teams that support them and so we have

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,170
the opportunity once again to

00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,630
consolidate best practices and patterns

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,760
and essentially managed way which we

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,130
believe will result in massive

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,650
efficiency gains not only in terms of

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:21,250
cost savings but in terms of lowering

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:25,570
complexity for application owners thus

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,700
making them far more productive and so

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:32,440
our managed delivery effort which

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:35,560
there's a least one talk this talk one

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,470
at least one there's many talks this

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,260
weekend regarding managed delivery but

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:45,070
this is a consolidation of best

00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,740
practices and in my opinion leapfrogs

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,020
the notion of let's say get ops which

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,180
we're effectively calling declarative

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,450
delivery and the idea of managed

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:59,240
delivery is that we can codify these

00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:02,600
best practices and take the

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,029
of software delivery off the hands of

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,819
application owners centrally manage it

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,379
but provide all the visibility needed so

00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:11,480
that you can still maintain your app and

00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:14,769
when it of course has an issue you are

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:19,249
still free to fix it the spinnaker

00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:21,800
ecosystem is stronger than ever and it's

00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:24,470
because of all of you here tonight and

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,220
if you are seeking ways to become more

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:31,249
plugged in to this community this is

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,259
your opportunity efforts into

00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:36,920
Spinnaker's plug-in system and the

00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:40,369
increasing transparency into the overall

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,679
project governance these efforts are

00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:44,809
drastically lowering the barrier to

00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:47,660
entry for you to get involved in this

00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:51,290
project so I can't wait to talk about

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,899
all the new things in version 4 of this

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:57,860
conference next year and I hope to see

00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:58,540
each and every one of you in 2020 thank

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:11,149
you

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:11,149
[Applause]

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,550
