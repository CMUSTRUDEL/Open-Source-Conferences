[Laughter]

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,480
to the last day of the spinnaker summit

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,230
thank you for being here this morning

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,590
I really appreciate it about three

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,800
months ago I was speaking to an

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,349
executive at JPMorgan Chase and in this

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,680
room it's myself and three other

00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:37,930
executives from armory and we are

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,900
selling spinnaker we're going through

00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,760
the features telling her about Bluegreen

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,550
Canary and rollbacks

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,890
all the things that you would expect

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,710
when you talk about spinnaker and I was

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,149
I'm going through that she interrupts me

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,000
and she says something to me that I just

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:59,079
didn't really expected her to say which

00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,180
she said while it's been a great a great

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,760
piece of technology the reason we are

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,199
standardizing on spinnaker and we are

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,020
supporting Spinnaker's because of the

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,750
people at the community and I absolutely

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,119
love that response and what it means is

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,710
really that she is choosing spinnaker

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,979
because of all the people in this room

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:20,830
not just the contributors people who are

00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:23,950
better but also the users the Evangelist

00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,510
that people who buy documentation Pete

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,000
who helped put this whole summit

00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,040
together and everybody who supports

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,990
spinnaker in their own wedding and I

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,049
just thought that was absolutely

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:37,000
fantastic and that is why wrong here

00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,090
today really if you think about this

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,920
vinegar summit is a celebration of the

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,930
community it is a celebration of

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,659
everything that we've done this year and

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,610
it's also an opportunity for us to align

00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:53,560
together about what we're going to do

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:55,750
next year so here are some of the

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,540
contributors some of the world's largest

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,420
cloud providers contributing code

00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,040
spinner so who knows who had any better

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,520
than Google who knows

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,770
ECS better than Amazon nobody knows this

00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,930
is what sets us apart we have the

00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,810
world's best volunteers which i think is

00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:16,000
very rare but we also have some of the

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,060
world's best users most progressive

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,600
users using spinnaker but they are

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,890
dealing with challenges at massive scale

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,540
and while those challenges are complex

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,880
and important when I really love about

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,920
our users and our community is actually

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,500
the compassion that you guys share to

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,630
each other every single day in slot and

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,880
I see it none of you have to help each

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,790
other but you do help each other through

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,830
those problems that you've experienced

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,320
before because there's no way the core

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,750
set of just contributors and support the

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,730
massive set of users are using Spencer

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,910
and I love that you also show up the

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,770
signe to get feedback wish you a lot of

00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,489
the ports which is great so we can fix

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:03,310
them the issue new artsy's new idea is

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,709
to help us understand what it is do you

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:11,100
need in order to be successful with the

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:13,060
spinner so this is a quote by a famous

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,180
management consultant named Peter

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,040
Drucker because many hooks out I'm sure

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,680
some of you have probably read some of

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,720
his books and what he's saying here is

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,480
culture eats strategy for breakfast and

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,750
what that means to me really is that

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,120
anybody can copy our features and

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,300
they're open source you literally

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,030
kasnian paste our features

00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,010
somewhere else anybody can copy our road

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,900
map our road map is publicly available

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,880
for you to see exactly what we're going

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,700
to build the best but when you can't

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,560
copy and you can't take from us is our

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,680
culture it's our community the things

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,720
that we stand for our values that is

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,400
what is unique to us and you can't take

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,010
that from us so what is our culture and

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,650
before we talk about our culture let's

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,200
talk about culture and gender so what is

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,480
culture cultures something that you

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,230
can't really touch but you can feel it

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,910
so let me ask you guys has anybody been

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,830
part of the toxic culture just raise

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:18,020
your hand right now the thing about that

00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,720
most of your is at hand if you didn't

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,240
raise your hand that's good

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,970
the thing about that is that nobody

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,800
intends to build a toxic culture it's

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,160
actually the lack of attention that

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,590
results in a toxic culture and so we as

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,500
a community we want to be intentional

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,750
about the community and the cultural

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,790
values that we're building and what

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,160
culture means to us is how we work

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,730
together how we make decisions but

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,710
difficult challenging problems arise

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:52,820
it's also how we come together and how

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:55,300
we show up for each other I got that

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,300
nice

00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:02,020
so a while back when we first started

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,270
our me asked Andy why he chose to open

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,270
source vinegar at Netflix one of the

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,969
things he said to me was that Netflix

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,860
had actually went faster and bringing

00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:15,189
the learnings from the community than

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,409
doing it on their own he valued the the

00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,360
openness that was out there he said we

00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,259
could do this better together and that

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,469
was pretty great

00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,840
because he had actually open source some

00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:27,490
proprietary technology to Netflix that

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,490
competitors were eventually going to get

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,189
ahold of but really what this meant when

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,169
this pirate acts for us is learning in

00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:40,210
that and that we're better together than

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:42,789
we are apart we also believe in learning

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:46,389
moments so of the visioning and the

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:49,060
title of this slide filler is okay but I

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,439
realized that failure is actually only a

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,560
failure if you don't take the

00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,029
opportunity to learn and so I changes to

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,370
learning moments and I think that's

00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:01,690
really what we're about right we're

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,120
about minimizing the impact of accidents

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,330
and learning from them so that we can

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,490
iterate and quickly move right reducing

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,469
kind of started catastrophic failures

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,430
and moving into things like fender

00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:20,830
benders so we can not be stopped by

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,120
crazy errors in production so we also

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,400
need a thought about the things that we

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,029
aren't and the things that we don't

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,860
value culture also encompasses that and

00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:31,300
it reminded me of the stoplight the

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,599
stoplight also have really good

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,389
intention but ask some serious flaws for

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,139
example 15 percent of all fatalities on

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:43,099
the road happen in that

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:45,620
with a stoplight it also has a hard

00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:50,840
dependency able to see when look just

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,069
ease out it no longer works it also has

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,650
to have perfect timing

00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:59,900
if the timing is off by just a little

00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:01,909
bit serious bombs could rise and worse

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,889
yet it actually incentivizes us to do

00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:06,680
the wrong thing we've actually spent

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:12,319
money on the like if you didn't really

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:14,750
interact and even the slightest

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,349
distraction could cause catastrophic

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,319
results and the be yourself attractive

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:22,969
as that you cannot be trusted that

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,419
somebody else makes miss decisions for

00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:28,159
you based on static context and we

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,039
believe that there's a better way a

00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:34,430
better analogy for who we are which is

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,439
around the map around about actually

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,689
puts the emphasis and the responsibility

00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,610
of the drivers to merge in and out

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:45,099
there's no dependency of electricity

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:47,449
it's just a circle the timing there's no

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,699
centralized timing is all decentralized

00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:52,610
to the drivers the drivers are making

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:55,520
assists the decision in real-time based

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:59,990
on the conditions on the road so it's

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,460
based on some loose rules we empower the

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,180
people on the road to make those

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,339
decisions it accounts for any road

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,399
conditions pedestrians anything that's

00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:13,550
out there people riding bikes again when

00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,199
you empower the driver right

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,720
you have to even let go of all these

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,110
other things like oh it's just

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,150
in centralized timing it actually allows

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,340
you to do the right thing when you enter

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,230
a roundabout you don't speed up like you

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,220
did with the yellow-eyed you enter with

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:32,289
safety and intense you're aware and the

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,090
basic assumption here is that you are to

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:38,800
be trust this is something that Angus

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,650
thought a lot about which is context

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,410
over control and we want to empower

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,480
these developers with information we

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,000
want to power drivers and information to

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,410
let them make the right decision we

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,730
don't want to take those rights away

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:58,240
from you we also believe in safety

00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:02,440
so in 1930 we introduced seatbelts and

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,910
in 1985 we also made the mandatory and

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,030
in both of those times

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,530
accidents actually went up not down and

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,000
it was really interesting to me to

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,220
figure out what was happening in his

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,160
time and what was happening was that

00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,870
while accidental accidents went up there

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,230
were minor actions they were fender

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,800
benders but when but when a down were

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,740
catastrophic events failures modalities

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,510
so we we ain't injected stated and what

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,760
ended up happening was we got

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,490
psychological safety we have physical

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,080
safety and we had enough driving factor

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,300
we got some quite ancient

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,310
eat faster and that's all sniffing what

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,560
you want now absolutely we're going to

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,510
get into accidents but that's okay as

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,380
long as they're minor accidents and

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:50,170
fender benders so one of the things that

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,480
we firmly believe in is that safety

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:56,589
enables velocity and now we're not

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,089
choosing between the two this is another

00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:01,149
thing that you'll hear and you say a lot

00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:03,940
power grid over gates and the reason

00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:06,120
this is important is the guardrails how

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,649
to tell us that that's no path to date

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,589
right but we don't want to enforce the

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:14,470
fact that we know best we know that as

00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,290
our contacts and our situations change

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,779
as we learn we're going to want to

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,760
change this but how can we learn we

00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:25,480
learned by experimenting we learned by

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,790
moving off the the best practice path we

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:32,050
try these things and as we are enforcing

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,940
what we know then we don't ever try

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,820
these days and this is really important

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,180
for us to have as a value and all of

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:42,760
these values are actually embodied in

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,480
sticker and you'll see them throughout

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,370
the product we give you context so you

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,070
have information about much blending in

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,920
production with what versions are there

00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:57,060
or container version is there load

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,800
balancer services journey networking

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,860
will tell you how that got there in the

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,200
first place

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,780
when it was the play what the play what

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,820
Trinity what system scented it necessary

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:12,740
we also have the barbarians which I need

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,150
to clear up like this and it didn't stop

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,520
you seem to play into production

00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,830
it'll inform you that this is probably

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,860
not the best time to deploy five night

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:25,370
at 6 p.m. but if you need to in case of

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,290
emergency you will we also have these

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,510
happy little accidents and production

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,840
that we can call canary right try these

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:37,040
things out in production is ok as long

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,780
as they're not catastrophic events we

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,270
also integrated with chaos monkey

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,010
we have resiliency is something that we

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,590
absolutely care about and in that

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,930
roundabout example really it's a

00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,510
resilient system regardless of the

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,710
conditions the drivers adapt to the

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:56,420
situation so what we believe we believe

00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,740
in empowering developers and you trust

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,290
your developers to make the right

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,800
decision that we are not choosing

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:07,520
between safety and velocity we see the

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,530
enables velocity context over control

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,180
that we will give you information for

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,130
you the driver to make the right

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,630
decision

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,430
guardrails over gates because we want to

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,040
empower people to innovate and try new

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,960
things we want a minute minimize

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,149
catastrophic events but we don't want to

00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,250
avoid them altogether we want

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,440
and we want to focus on things like

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,060
resiliency want to iterate and learn and

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,260
detect errors to see how can adapt to

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,870
them so this creates a pliable is that

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,839
and this waterwheel effect that we have

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,399
in our community is embodied in our

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,399
opinionated platform that we call

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,800
spinnaker that is consumed by

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,540
improvisers and businesses that also

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,940
help them go through this transformation

00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,430
and change that our entire industry is

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,430
going through right now as they learn

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,350
and as they ain't values from spinnaker

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:01,500
and they see their company's changed

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,800
they'll join our community too and we'll

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,810
grow and we're school scale and that

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,660
will help our values in the community

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,980
adapter and around and around we go and

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,500
let's think about a flywheel in that you

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,240
can actually invest in an area any area

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,420
of the flywheel interaction make it go

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,300
faster and once a flywheel has momentum

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,339
is really really hard to stop and that

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,920
what we're building and I've seen this

00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:28,829
for the last three years in this summer

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,250
as we continue to grow our values

00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:35,730
continue to deepen we continue to learn

00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:36,899
faster than anybody else I also wanted

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,300
to give thanks to the technical

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:44,839
oversight committee so if you're one of

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,839
these five people did you stand up here

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:59,070
the ones that have to take all of the

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,610
values that we want to happen community

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,020
and actually put it into practice and

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,510
believe it or not it's actually hard to

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,370
get Google Netflix Amazon or armoring to

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,620
all do the same thing and go the same

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,900
direction and it's not easy and so I'm

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,630
very appreciative of these people who

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,310
are doing work every single day to make

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,050
sure that we are all working well

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:23,250
together and we all embodied these

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:26,820
values so I'll end on this so this is

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:31,230
moment this really beautiful moment that

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:34,260
happens in humanity it's you're on the

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:37,260
road in your car and you hear the siren

00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,510
is coming it's going you look in your

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,029
rear-view mirror and cars start

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,870
Department way and then of course you

00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:48,420
part rights go to disorderly and in that

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:52,080
moment when that ambulance is speeding

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,550
by what we've done is that we've put the

00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,640
needs of somebody else

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:59,610
above our we've collectively created

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,390
this tap for this ambulance that go on

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:06,600
by and this I believe is what we need a

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:09,540
more of in our community we need to

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,910
elevate our community above the needs of

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,010
our homes and then when we do that the

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,190
stronger our community will be because

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:19,620
ultimately what sets spinnaker and our

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:22,500
community products of anybody else is us

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,589
and the stronger that we are and the

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:29,010
better that we are the better Stanford

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:32,179
community so thank you

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,179
[Applause]

00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,319
you

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:44,980
good morning everyone my name is Michael

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,370
Benedict and I'm here to talk about CICU

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,680
at Pinterest something about me I'm

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:54,040
using in front of the organization on

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,390
Pinterest and we know one thing our goal

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,630
is to help make their developers

00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:02,649
extremely active happy agree about their

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:05,410
job this is my Pinterest board and I

00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:09,670
think before I start who hasn't heard

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,740
about Pinterest okay so that's really

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:15,390
good anyways I was going to do a product

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:18,279
 over there for Pinterest anyway so

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,410
Pinterest just a we train our mission is

00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,300
one thing you want to bring everyone the

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,540
inspiration to create a life day long

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:27,610
and more specific we wouldn't help

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,890
people rediscover these things and maybe

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,170
pursue that outside the norms of his

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,970
screen or their application for example

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,130
underneath is amazing thank you today

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,350
very much rice making the cutters over

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,260
here I think this board collection of

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,760
moldable shoes which my wife is not

00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,019
gonna be very happy about but then again

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,930
just to give you context and how large

00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:52,360
interest rate is we serve more than 320

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:56,290
million user it's not across across the

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,500
globe and Pinterest collectively holds

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,899
over 200 million pins pins is basically

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,120
they read about say tweet and Twitter or

00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:07,419
a post in any other comments which

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,850
meaning the thing is that most important

00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:11,709
about aspect of fact is it's all human

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:15,480
curating like people have actually taken

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:17,970
the extra step in something it could be

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,949
in video and actually categorize the

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,819
white annotations which provide these

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:27,720
amazing visual graphs of what's also

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,610
really likable - they get inspired with

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,710
that how does the our job is to provide

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,200
amazing delightful experiences to our

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,179
pinners and that means my team's job is

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,130
to make sure every engineering company

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,130
is again a very productive and this is

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,919
our vision our job is to provide a fast

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,919
safe and a delightful path to take an

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,450
idea to production and key thing to know

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,320
it over there because we don't want

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,149
anyone to worry about infrastructure

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,010
with that let me tell you a story about

00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:57,860
a continuous delivery and how to proceed

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,630
move from what used to do today

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:04,230
previously in terms of deploying two

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,580
machines one by one - right now fully

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,940
embracing that continuous integration

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,909
into the pre platform any team the

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,830
Ottoman this was in the process we

00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:19,260
basically made tracks as we were moving

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:21,029
fast Tino right now but I think I really

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,880
want to give you the complexity how hard

00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:25,649
this is and just a point rate this is

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,970
meeting on a technical challenge and

00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:29,309
that's what we am here to talk about

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:32,220
it's more of a process challenge

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:34,019
so before I get started this is kind of

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,720
the Pinterest is that side of the brain

00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:37,180
right

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,590
bring the amount excited stack and the

00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:43,990
serve excited staff and this reason I

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,090
want to show this is it wasn't really

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,130
one for us to first understand like

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,780
where the proper maybe lies and then

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,110
focus on that but they would call in to

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:56,110
solve to give you a footprint of how

00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,610
large an infrastructure is it's

00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:00,760
freelance I won't really go through the

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,440
number instance is there but then come

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,900
back to helping you find the problem

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,210
how's the architecture play a role with

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,630
our footprint and how we decided to

00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:15,190
sauce it up how did we design solve a

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:17,500
problem so good McIntyre we realized

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:21,250
that interest again it runs one of the

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,290
largest modulus we are going - so our

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:26,200
stomachs factors to the top right there

00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,700
are api of service entire bike service

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,010
both of them are still on their

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:34,180
monolithic though I can

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:35,800
so this grab any hopes and adjust your

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,240
perspective on hot water that is we

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,340
actually have one that 200 plus

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,860
engineers committee code to just those

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,810
two systems we see more than three

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,580
thousand five minutes a month and it

00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:48,190
runs a little black classic servers and

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,630
secrete our system and that may help us

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,510
focus we realized that if we could

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,250
unlock value for those any engineers for

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,890
shooting these amazing features of

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,080
interest dinners that we the biggest

00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:02,590
buyer back to show the organization how

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,180
we can really fast so we get point it to

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,550
a particular service of a particular

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,860
assistant and region that has a large

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,990
amount of a and we started doing deep

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,570
down into trillions and companies are

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:17,049
happening for that part and yes it's a

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:20,220
long list of challenges I'm just

00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:23,230
top ten they're nothing more than that

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,940
but true chemistry at a high level one

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,369
of the key things which was trading us

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,559
in the past is diploma 1689

00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:32,799
we wouldn't actually do the plummets

00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:35,289
twice a day scheduled at 10 a.m. and 2

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,629
p.m. and rest assured never was that

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,399
schedule a cherry we were never going to

00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,809
play out because there's so many that's

00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:42,369
going out there was so many users trying

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,739
push that changes that was extremely

00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:47,139
hard and just to get a sense of why that

00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:48,820
was the case we did have full analysis

00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:51,909
and planets than the palm segment and

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,859
this is what we came up with with that

00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:55,600
wasn't understood what the problem was

00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:57,070
the next step is to define ballistic

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,350
success criteria how do you actually

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,840
convince people that appears that they a

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,639
problem but how do you measure success

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,980
so that's the next thing which we when

00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:09,429
we start focusing on we circles with

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,019
people emitters so one is velocity we

00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,460
Negrito started like I'm spending

00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,470
metrics and how long does it take

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,299
another airship coated from idea the

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,119
production the second one is what

00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:20,529
quality how can you know find that

00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,159
Howard before he gets deployed a

00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:26,499
question and finally reliability how

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,869
often was back hooked up again deployed

00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:31,690
and has a significant impact on our

00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:34,090
business metrics obviously it's very

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,649
hard all these members together involved

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,929
with one single metric but we were

00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:39,929
pretty close it I like because we came

00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,510
up with this one release Nisour though

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:48,190
the p90 turning which

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:50,020
minute plans to deploy and this one gets

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,050
pd-1 more about that later

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,550
so they step into an experience now that

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,530
we have the common domain we have a

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,750
success metric we have a so figure out

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,970
what is the right number there let's

00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,970
understand how we go back in 20 that

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,710
number to iterative to experience this

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,140
until it's started this is the first

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:12,130
variation of how we started doing CSEE

00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,740
at Pinterest we said that be able to

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,080
start deploy 9:38 going to continue to

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,440
try to play this manually so like am i

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,750
pathetic and you can see actually timing

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,700
on customize and this is how it goes

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,430
through them on a day to day basis and

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:30,310
the day they actually hour by hour basis

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,870
I was living this every day

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,690
let me meet obviously there's a

00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,390
collection of on-call engineers and they

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,010
came for this but this is what every day

00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,600
they were doing to emulate what

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,840
continues them that we actually meetings

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,640
and yes it's a very hard process and you

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,890
can see there's my technique actually

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,590
posting innovative high status so we got

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,180
from you know one or two success one

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,700
place to Porsche system the customer

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,730
service

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,320
the other another one again you're

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,859
making some progress but we started too

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,139
many fears and finally we were so happy

00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:06,980
when we managed to get that we to deploy

00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:14,659
today is insane and you can see the

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:17,690
number of crews and yes it's it was so

00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:22,399
much but battery help us understand what

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:24,289
we should i what should we focus on so

00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:27,049
overall again says across the region

00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:29,149
code test bill to plug the degree and

00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:30,830
operations so we did didn't money that

00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:33,710
there are key areas in each of these

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,419
specific hitters to automate and focus

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:38,090
on that's what I'm very much

00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:39,889
highlighting in nature for example it's

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,809
a no-brainer that you have to do any

00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:42,619
other validation every actually pushes

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:44,629
you master

00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:46,759
but yes and we actually have to get back

00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:49,220
to how often does it break things about

00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:53,090
we decided that we absolutely need an

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,529
older Testament of test with pretty

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,690
precise owners so that we can actually

00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:59,480
go ahead and block the releases if

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,889
something else include the movement by

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,499
bringing some little complexity while

00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,970
introducing clean the books first go see

00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,919
I said there's a need for a synchronous

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,070
my clients and and obviously canary

00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:12,799
analysis to make sure that we monitor

00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,179
and finally you want to fail fast and

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,909
you want to make sure that you can roll

00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:21,559
back or meet any sort of ideas shared

00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:22,429
untouched and yes obviously pipelines is

00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,160
a big thing

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:27,910
this is my first time spending right

00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:31,900
but clearly this enabled us to do most

00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:34,500
we start orchestrating RCX to be process

00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,460
interaction space and pipelines

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,350
twenty-somethings is on the top of the

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,850
Latinas deployment pipeline there's a

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,520
very specific one you can see in the

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,280
bottom but being provided our service a

00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,530
person that's the ability which of had

00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:51,790
seven stages and experiences as part of

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:53,560
that will uh process Junior

00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,150
we actually mentioned that world where

00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,730
women have Google hundreds of become a

00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:00,550
genius and a single deployed what's

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,830
happening today 95 could you sleep

00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,300
interests being deployed as you can see

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,340
at every we worked on that regular

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,900
experience where now we're shooting by

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,790
three commits for comments on every

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,920
deployed and either if there's a finger

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,630
at the best we're going back to my

00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,850
treatments which is insane

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:20,950
and finally measure I think this is the

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,900
best practice show like I always heard

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,940
the saw the customers and executives at

00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,370
Pinterest and we see where the

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,290
inflection point is the blue baboon

00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,150
basically show you can repeat anytime

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,620
you're stationary magic commit and how a

00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,840
drastically reduced while remember the

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,340
plug is increase and that's why we can

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,840
be spending it right but you can start

00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,810
seeing the number of employees we do go

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,470
up I think you in perspective we

00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:47,050
actually do more than 25 clothes a day

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:49,450
continue from 95 and the pinna

00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,310
it's are actually under four hours there

00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,170
are testimonials from users who say my

00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,400
stomach and I forget about it because I

00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,680
know within a certain amount of hours

00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:02,170
that's a question that's initiatives or

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:03,970
pairs so I would oppose this hooking it

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,070
up into more slides and one thing is I

00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,420
just repeated mr. recently the graph you

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,830
see there is fascinating and I'm so good

00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,500
just because those are basically all the

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,870
shots which go up within a pair of day

00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,580
and that was happening to fight so yeah

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,890
I mean we don't have to stop the upon

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,870
this after 12 p.m. and yes this story

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:26,400
was never possible in this but today

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:29,200
this is how we're doing self interest in

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,000
finding a new go to table to the top

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,680
which is happening today were 30 bike

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,930
totally amazing engineers who are here

00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,550
somewhere

00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:38,500
rainy and jazz what are we talking about

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,240
how he production ice vinegar I think

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,540
there's a time to being able what we

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,490
just saw the amazing stats up over oh

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,770
the climate like Vickers

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,750
so with that but I just like giving for

00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:53,550
the time this is an amazing community

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,550
between excited to be part of this

00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,249
[Applause]

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,940
good morning all right

00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:13,389
and all that means is responsible for

00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:15,009
all that means it's just just the

00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:17,919
technical strategy in architectural

00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:20,169
direction for our internal platforms you

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,850
probably as many of you probably know is

00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:24,070
an observer ability for a platform I

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,669
mean you don't don't know what that

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,620
means is that we are taxed that absorbs

00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:31,960
the elements of observable systems so

00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,690
metrics Grace's long events you name it

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,210
I may allow you to do things with it

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:41,409
alerting that putting is doing more and

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:43,990
more AI functionality and just help me

00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:46,450
make sense of all the balconies where

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,110
your systems and currently we're

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,999
ingesting 1.3 billion events per minute

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,970
which is quite a lot at 22 million per

00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:57,879
second so we manage my log data

00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:00,340
structure and rather than giving you

00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:01,690
more boring biographical information

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,240
about myself I think it's more

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:09,070
interesting to look at I wear my csdb

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:12,039
journey began and see how that's like

00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,509
how things have evolved but also the

00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:16,299
themes of the consistent over the years

00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:19,899
where the themes that I should talk

00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:20,830
about in this talk so much screenshots

00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:23,020
for the Flickr

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,120
I was actually really excited to see

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,040
them being taught that that flipper

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,950
Engineers gave literally 10 years ago

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:33,250
about giving 10 plus the push per day of

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,900
our at the time PHP monolith I thought I

00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,370
still up the slide share the URL is

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,710
really long ago much easier to find it

00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,870
by googling and so if you wanna go check

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,680
that out and you can do a walk down

00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:46,900
memory lane

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:49,570
so again things like this this is how we

00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,110
deploy tomorrow Flickr by the way was

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:56,860
only ever about 12 to 15 engineers

00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:58,600
during this era and so growing and

00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,920
pretty simple but it got the job done

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,240
until you look at what the top is

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,950
something moving around in to the law of

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,680
what's been deployed and when but also

00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:10,960
there is it check box and see why

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,020
continue to chat in your log and you

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,930
need the chat log so that you can tell

00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:19,480
people not to deploy and the way the

00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:21,340
system works is things went from we call

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,290
the trunk at the time to staging

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,270
automatically and then you went and

00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:27,580
looked inside think it was broken on

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,260
staging and if it was you went and said

00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,850
well don't click means because if

00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,270
someone deployed those probably copied

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,710
Canadian production and I know I've seen

00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,870
easily interesting to watch the

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,060
progression of these arrival time so

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,070
fast forward 10 years I'm in relic now

00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,820
and we're still deploying all the things

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:49,370
but all the things look very different

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:51,890
new relic is just over 500 engineer

00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,960
and until very recently a human we have

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,310
more services than have engineers right

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,980
so micro service architecture has

00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,390
introduced a lot of a lot of amenities

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,230
but also a lot of complexity to your

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:06,350
point and so we give our engineers a lot

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,090
freedom to do what they need to do to

00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,800
solve their problems there's not a lot

00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,810
of description going on and you know

00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,010
what language their platform to use it's

00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,840
not a total free-for-all

00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:17,270
you have to kinda makes it maybe taste

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,130
for it but in the end I ended up with it

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,550
pretty you know it's not a big monolith

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,980
it's 500 services in you know as many as

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:27,950
80 different platforms fortunately it's

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,720
all in containers which makes life a

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,910
little bit easier in terms of operating

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,460
this system in terms of the people for

00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,350
it but they're still like the tools

00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,700
really have to nail it right because

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:42,350
otherwise it's just impossible to handle

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:44,360
that complexity so in 2016 we rolled out

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,070
a maze of marathon based platform to

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,690
support our application different

00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:51,650
service developers right folks that own

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:54,530
most of the services that are stateless

00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,750
that are either HTTP for network

00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,880
services or their cue consumers so to

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,430
serve that I introduced NATO's marathon

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,080
and it worked really well

00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:08,660
honestly it's still up it's still most

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,950
most of our most of those services go

00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,660
around that platform that everyone is

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:17,260
going doctor that's been super happy

00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:20,290
however as we you know look at like

00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:24,470
where the application is a homegrown

00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:27,860
multi tier distributed database right

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,330
which is what powers the core of the

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,580
earliest analytics features I called

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,410
energy V if that's the case you know

00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,790
deploying

00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,260
the boy strategies just aren't

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,480
sufficient but it's just too complex

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,540
there's too many too much steeped right

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,440
you have to manage storage if you're

00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,730
trying to grow the cluster you have to

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,140
move data if you're trying to do

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,520
maintenance you have to make sure that

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,570
that data can be sir from somewhere else

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,080
and you just do not need a lot

00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:54,420
complexity using these those without

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:58,880
yeah without this too much too much

00:31:54,420 --> 00:32:00,810
resilient in the meantime to serve the

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,730
customers that we need on this platform

00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:05,000
we need to be spent in fact a man called

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,560
Frank cycled in Grand Central

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,600
the main feature of it is that it allows

00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,490
the service order to declare whether

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,990
service is and what it's supposed to do

00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,660
and how it needs to be the forty

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:18,240
declaratively and is attached to their

00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:21,240
people right it's in version control and

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,090
so you can register your repo the tool

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,740
means your description so there's

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,090
certain ones about like this don't try

00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,980
to eat it it's just boring the animal

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:31,110
like any other boring me out but it's

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,630
all in the system you know what it needs

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:35,430
to know about people in your service

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:38,280
when you see that we can get back in

00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,750
this tree right again all the same

00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,160
things on it but obviously people have

00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,080
invested a lot more effort into making

00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,610
it look nice and then the screen that we

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,140
worked on it clicker but it's not all

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:50,640
the same stuff to know who deployed what

00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:53,160
plan when the boys failed and you know

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,720
what changes were deployed and but you

00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,030
know it's also a lot more complexity

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,730
goes again this is we're not looking at

00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:01,380
a deployed page for one of these 500

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,940
services that we have right so the tool

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,340
handles all our environmental our

00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,850
current services its us a pretty man's

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:12,600
but it's you know it's it was build with

00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:15,000
marathon line so they came time to serve

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,750
the other 20 plus teams that were still

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,390
just rolling their software directly

00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:22,640
host right and just interacting directly

00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,700
with those whether it's through scripts

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,640
or something intangible we realized we

00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:31,030
had work to do and so that's what that's

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,260
why the what I call the 20 20 plus

00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:35,150
internal plan comes Anna actually dollar

00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,880
TV production but you know we're still

00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:39,559
rolling out it's almost a cluster

00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,210
grenades platform where we're splitting

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,679
things out both by functionality and

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:47,480
also by customer forwards to give us

00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:51,260
more likely more ability to experiment

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,640
and just being able to the grantees bid

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,059
is what enabled us to actually serve a

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,500
more complex use cases so instead of

00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:59,270
just saying hey let's might create all

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,919
these happy application and service

00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,910
developers off the marathon if you burn

00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,860
any of these seven tears

00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,510
they're already happy we could literally

00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,559
make it so that they've deployed one

00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,810
beam would end up in a different

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,490
Orchestrator maybe not here let's target

00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:13,159
the folks who are currently not serving

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,929
at all and so we did that and we're

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:16,429
possible to using staple sets we're

00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,490
really not like to use it it's like the

00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,320
aforementioned and our DB which is kinda

00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,490
like to do with using that far enough

00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,480
but is it really

00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:28,340
we're using CR using an operator this is

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,450
the first kubernetes related event and

00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,070
you maybe don't know what that is

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:33,050
strd is a custom research definition

00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:37,070
it's just a way to teach coordinating

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:38,629
about ending a new map I say just is

00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,159
actually incredibly powerful

00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:41,540
what that allows you to do is it allows

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,909
you to write code that runs on your

00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:47,800
grenades control plane that understands

00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:51,610
you know yeah new yellow basket for days

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,350
Arenado right so you can say oh well I

00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,100
found the center DD Buster who ran it is

00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,630
know what that is

00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,490
and you can throw it for anything eise

00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,800
knows what that means that's really

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,930
powerful but you need to deploy all that

00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,280
right so the boys look very different in

00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,810
this in this world it's not just going

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,880
to play the new version and make sure it

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,580
works correctly it's potentially

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,230
deployed you know new version the part

00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,500
of this particular tier of this complex

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,870
system it's potentially you know wrong

00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,430
you need data pretty low support this

00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,890
particular host before we want machine

00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:22,870
based I'm sorry before we deploy code on

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,220
it so we have to support all that we

00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,990
still want visibility into what's

00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:30,420
happening there we still want the same

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:34,630
features like auto in Japan and you know

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:36,130
apples go ahead so spinnaker fortunately

00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,720
has elements right surrounded to try to

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,400
build all of that into our system you

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,960
said that somebody's the community ones

00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,430
don't work the rest of the grenades

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,470
community communities already doing

00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:48,010
let's take advantage of that the hybrid

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:49,150
for us is canary support for Andrew up I

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,340
don't you all as the language that you

00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,260
used to speak to underneath what we used

00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,770
to get metrics out of it

00:35:53,260 --> 00:36:00,580
and you can tell vinegar worried right

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:02,770
you can even ask ask energy be whatever

00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,740
you want it's not just based on air raid

00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:09,340
or for any specific whatever events our

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:11,950
metrics your service reduces you can you

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,780
can interrogate those and the community

00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,070
has delivered really experience that

00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,380
we've been able to merge pull request

00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:19,240
really quickly production of ever our

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:23,200
environment the onboarding have been

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,350
great and now he doesn't even boring

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,420
either

00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:29,150
just another vinegar screen but here we

00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,550
are right here is about your production

00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,920
services appointee validities start

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:35,720
using standard kubernetes we still going

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,340
to do we would like the expanded

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,990
understand what series they're doing a

00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,990
little bit better and you started a lot

00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:43,040
new products for new use cases right

00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,540
those employees are very different

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,160
you don't want every single team on

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,920
these cable service defining their own

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,900
pipelines from scratch over and over and

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,840
when they do we want to give them

00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,520
guardrails right we're still very early

00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,830
in this process and we're still trying

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,620
to figure out exactly how to get users

00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:03,290
to be able to do a fermentation review

00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:06,920
so the luminaries still do proper

00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:09,800
validation etc I'm severely sickness

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,390
topic obviously like everybody else on

00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,840
the planet for hiring so please come

00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,910
talk to me

00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,980
you like here's my email address and

00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,980
LinkedIn I thank you very much

00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,730
[Applause]

00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:35,350
again engineer that recently took some

00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:37,930
of the responsibilities as the team

00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:40,420
manager as well I know that Sony

00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,810
PlayStation Network locally here in San

00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,330
Diego

00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:46,090
the last couple years have been pretty

00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:48,070
exciting for our DevOps scene as you

00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,510
migrated our network services to the

00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,820
cloud I'll tell you a little bit about

00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:54,660
that journey the technology the people

00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,890
and where spinnaker fits into the story

00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,270
Unforgiven II but the thing is how we're

00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:00,220
carrying a nautical theme with the

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:03,580
spinnaker in kubernetes this week and

00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,650
San Diego got a a bad sailing city

00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,080
itself I'm gonna sprinkle some some

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:11,920
nautical references and as we also to

00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:16,750
humor me all right so our voyage to the

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,820
glad Leonard in 2018 completed our

00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:22,200
voyage to the cloud you've lifted and

00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,130
shifted about 100 services on our

00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,610
PlayStation Network conference and

00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:29,190
accounts paid from our data center

00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:32,580
as any of us about our production we're

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:35,040
clubs are running on AWS ec2 we've got

00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,830
almost everything this code word stored

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,400
inside in the left view infrastructure

00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:43,100
pieces go by we're running our

00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,280
continuous integration and continuous

00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:53,820
delivery the employments on our Jenkins

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:56,430
pipelines we are using high score factor

00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,860
in ansible to create NWS Amazon machine

00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:02,520
images and we're deploying immutable

00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:05,580
images to ec2 with our in-house built

00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:15,390
CSV tool chain which coincidentally is

00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:19,040
also made Hyperloop tech behind the

00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:22,500
scenes with Jacob files job it goes the

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,940
confirmation code by client that's it so

00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,920
it's Goldberg not unlike what andrew

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,530
from google described last night as

00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,050
keynote but hey it works it works pretty

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:36,090
well we're playing through you not here

00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,190
to fight on your hobby the deployments a

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,800
day in our

00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:42,619
integration QA additional partner

00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:46,220
integration environments now we've got

00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:48,800
some manual gates before delivering to

00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:54,020
our production and customer network but

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:57,680
we're looking to streamline that visit

00:39:54,020 --> 00:40:02,060
three move our ecology 2018 period now

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:05,480
it's January of 2019 khou-tv all right

00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:08,329
what's next so what remember this is a

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,010
list of chip solution we're hearing a

00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:12,650
lot about cloud native we're not cloud

00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:18,109
native but I'm pretty cool we want equal

00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:20,089
to so that's history now contained

00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:21,710
there's one doctor we want kubernetes

00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:24,980
and since we're already in the name of

00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:28,310
us let's use Amazon's elastic kubernetes

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,079
service 30 days everybody deploy this

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,260
how do we get to that lush green

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,220
tropical island that is cloud age you

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,980
know we have a lot to learn about

00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,480
containers running on kubernetes and you

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,010
don't have a lot of time or interest in

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,030
building our own deployment and

00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:46,790
operation school and heard before we

00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:48,650
want to take advantage of the larger

00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:54,109
about an Operations community

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:54,630
so where's your this vinegar wage and

00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:57,610
let's

00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:59,440
that doctor we've got home templates not

00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,280
only for a few deployment manifest

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,480
before infrastructure as code as well

00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,830
but empathize on our confirmation

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,620
without and run it on a black dks as far

00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:13,690
as our installation goes we've got

00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,030
certificate researchers code we've got

00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:18,670
home charts confidence you keep asking

00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:21,220
for structure stats are using halyard

00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:24,820
spinnaker config files maintains and get

00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,070
and good one for one with genja since we

00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:31,210
are using my genius my clients can fire

00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:34,270
spend criticisms to using spinnaker to

00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:37,780
the place an anchor but indeed that some

00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:40,300
people so we passed your integrated with

00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:42,850
our security infrastructure of our lives

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,740
we delivered a passion for vault for a

00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:47,500
secret management we've got held up for

00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,780
reviews management and octave for our

00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,560
multi-factor authentication that we've

00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,210
pretty well

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,240
productionize diverge it's vinegar

00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:58,420
instance when a finitary using that

00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,410
memphis-based to read and easy to

00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:04,840
provider I would get home packages based

00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,550
with environment values override and

00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,250
your manual

00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:12,730
canary deployment pipeline and we can

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:15,220
create our spending her without our

00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,320
tendency I see my clients via web of

00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,450
triggers to coordinating parallel

00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,610
deployments to ec2 and eks doesn't

00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:25,480
migrate our services that spirit attacks

00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:28,030
were running on ec2 and I mean that's

00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,730
the river now those are deployment

00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:33,400
strategy must establish our wounds each

00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,350
end on the island of five dated by

00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,720
migrating a pilot service single file

00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:40,720
service PKS be sure the PlayStation

00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,060
Network account entitlement service it's

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,010
a critical piece of our infrastructure

00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,770
we're serving twenty thousand

00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:51,000
transactions per second on summer going

00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:51,000
all that I noticed surveillance

00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:57,400
technology let's talk about the people

00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,500
as a junior agency our team didn't have

00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,540
much experience building to G nice

00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,720
services we had put a little experience

00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:08,980
with kubernetes no experience with eks

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,510
and astronauts frances swaggart we

00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:15,670
wanted to get this pilot done quickly so

00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:16,840
we formed a blankie and if you haven't

00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,430
seen the pony dynamite

00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,750
although here's a cross between a lion

00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:24,590
and tiger and they're pretty awesome so

00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:27,330
let your team was composed

00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,400
development dev ops ops cloud

00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:31,740
infrastructure security in architecture

00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,260
and a few program product managers

00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,110
thrown in for good measure we all work

00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,020
together in our Langer den to get this

00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:43,200
pilot done once moved quickly many

00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:45,960
luxury of building out our CG pipeline

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,570
spinnaker in the drydock if you will we

00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,420
were building it our ship is see under

00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:54,270
logo from our continuous that service

00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,190
the planets needless to say we made some

00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:58,500
mistakes along the way we learned to be

00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:00,660
iterative we started with a very basic

00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,580
spinnaker installation but we were able

00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,770
to keep it stable and because we built

00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:08,280
our infrastructure as code from day one

00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:11,040
we could spin up one spinnaker instance

00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,040
I hand that off to our developers and

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,340
our operations team members that could

00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,260
use it to employ well background we had

00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:21,510
a couple other spinnaker instances for

00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,530
our continued generations in the

00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:27,090
building our production I think

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:29,370
spinnaker itself so just a couple months

00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,930
ago we had our spinnaker installation

00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:33,750
process that's the point where we could

00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:35,640
stand up an entire production instance

00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,920
from source and immediately deploy

00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,010
services introduction I would that

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,280
instance so a grounded service

00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:46,830
deployment and development development

00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,810
deployment iterations I did not seem to

00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:52,280
spank her to the deploy at mill and you

00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:55,050
have a beautiful manifest basic plants

00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,240
Feniger gave us visibility into pot

00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,070
health container and application startup

00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,670
logs which was really important as we

00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:07,620
were learning to build employ operate

00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:09,560
our clustering germinates we had simple

00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,330
repeatable deployments

00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,619
again developers I've seen playing ml

00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:17,249
and

00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:20,910
when it's synchronized with ec2 and dks

00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:23,069
platforms team members were able to

00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,869
build and tweak their own pipelines as

00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:27,839
we all figured out what our pipelines I

00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:30,480
needed to look like and in summary in

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,670
the course of 10 months we learned to

00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,900
install and operate spinnaker and he

00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,420
can't have all the same time using

00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,609
spinnaker deploy and operate our service

00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,819
deployment any chaos collection turned

00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:43,589
into our CSE pipeline to allow

00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:46,289
continuous and secret deployments with

00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:48,210
both ec2 you can ask so now we've got

00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:49,559
our entitlement service running in

00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,690
production together running the money

00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:55,079
see too many KS and we do dial traffic

00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:57,240
back and forth this is really giving us

00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,420
the safety net and the confidence to

00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:05,400
continue to tune our kubernetes

00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:08,519
infrastructure to memory parameter

00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:12,119
tuning on our pods worker node instance

00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:15,630
type scaling etc so we're next steps

00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:18,150
we've got work to do to build out

00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,769
continuous deployments with spinnaker of

00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:23,239
course we want to build a pipeline cisco

00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:27,420
has to be on board morph services and

00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:29,670
give developers pipeline templates we

00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,519
want to scale that well and over the

00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:34,789
next several months we've got various

00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:38,150
waves of onboarding new services to

00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:41,119
kubernetes with spinnaker him

00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:43,849
a lot of those 500 daily des Plantes

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:48,230
juice man so thank you

00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:50,809
and San Diego well continue looking

00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:53,289
outside in a few minutes to enjoy the

00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,289
weather here

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,030
leverage shared libraries commit

00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:07,440
generation and how that connected could

00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:10,000
speed safety and adoption Atticus every

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,589
Sochi does gave me a quick intro someone

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,369
spent too much time here but my name is

00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:14,530
Steve market

00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:16,630
I started at Discovery about 40 years

00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:29,710
ago my company cloud solutions engineer

00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:32,140
I based solutions but overall he 90 what

00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:34,930
we support today and men equally

00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:37,300
distributed teams and they manage things

00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,849
in this access content delivery rights

00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,000
management generally from my teeth broad

00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:46,030
net system security teams video Amanda

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,210
pledge speed would pull a across both

00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:53,230
Amazon TCP and where are the communities

00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:54,839
in most cases and in currently 150

00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:57,550
services in production per team and

00:47:54,839 --> 00:48:01,119
numerous languages but very rarely Java

00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:03,849
Nokia's Python is something I'm very

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,010
focused sources and their tools relevant

00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:07,930
to this would be high football right

00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:14,470
there is itself Harvard or Stanford

00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:15,880
itself so what we started when I think

00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,680
this letter for theatres ago when the

00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,410
developers were looking to shift towards

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,000
and microskirts architecture but as you

00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,210
can see the list here we had basically

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,490
every problem that you could have like

00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:32,079
to set up a new services of daisies

00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:34,359
worst case months whistle the plane is

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,220
her extremely error-prone that are done

00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:39,880
on weekends through part down finally

00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:42,220
require dozens of teams to be involved

00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:45,070
ESP news to my party

00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,300
like our database migrations someone

00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:49,090
else when we brought in art that

00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:52,420
Canadians affiliated to J loss or doctor

00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:55,450
to tailor the environment super

00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,650
inconsistent like you had no idea what

00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,690
you really ran in your test environment

00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:01,720
was actually going to work

00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:03,550
and a lot of times a bit and we know the

00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,670
times it's rules by the adoption rates

00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:09,550
like way of putting a PM tools but what

00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:11,260
guy was using it for managing of 60

00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:18,310
applications that he managed for

00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:20,349
developers our single person see their

00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:23,349
goal is when we started we obviously

00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:25,030
wanted to get away from weeks at a time

00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:27,340
that wouldn't service and to make it

00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:29,140
very quickly so we are aiming for 10

00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,970
minutes for someone running a job so

00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:34,030
I'll check Pressey production for that

00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:36,099
application we wanted a full complete

00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:39,340
configuration production and all our

00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:41,440
flights finally get so we're looking

00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,540
just for a simple application with the

00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,660
health check and it came configured all

00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:50,020
secret mention it so a full CIC pipeline

00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:53,589
for all sorts of networking ingress in

00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:57,160
this certificates and as well as

00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:58,119
monetary blogging metrics Lawrence

00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,510
dashboards

00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,740
ideally we want all the stuff by people

00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:04,750
and then with all that we're hoping to

00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:07,450
get a quick safety limit of clinics

00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:09,420
where it flows through the tools or

00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:12,020
identical leather guitar for gratis

00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:15,590
experience

00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:18,170
maybe - accessories nothing and lastly

00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:21,560
when I can easily and great name in the

00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:23,810
terms of maintenance our EVPs could run

00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,990
this job set of a new application and

00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:32,960
take my updated after but they can t

00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:35,720
star on we usually started in a bunch of

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,910
illegal us so we probably chosen

00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:41,450
terrifying kubernetes to divide all of

00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:43,100
our service components so that gives us

00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:45,260
you know everything that has been

00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:48,380
waiting to do this service is going to

00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:50,600
be the binding big boys these many files

00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:52,790
from our trading engine as files to buy

00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,390
in some of those two days and deploy

00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:59,870
them obviously one as much as possible I

00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:02,120
think they started to get hundreds and

00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:04,820
ideally I'd say around ninety five

00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,500
percent for a lot of things and then

00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,090
lastly once we go on this Monday that

00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,470
really easy to update and maintain

00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:13,940
existing services so we're able to use

00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,740
reusable code ease the generation

00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,300
employs the standards and apply those

00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:20,240
updates

00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:22,550
so this case that Erica module being

00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,760
taken share pipeline everything he can

00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:26,790
play as

00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,200
lacy to obviously do not even either

00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:34,320
pool we're talking about here as long as

00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:36,510
they support some form of that so now

00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,250
that if we have these building blocks in

00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:41,880
place and we can kind of defiance that

00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:43,619
we want it's still relatively slow

00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,109
without in to reach the water and open

00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:47,670
hours today's range we still have a

00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:51,270
couple teams that need to be involved is

00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:53,609
selfless service and more or less people

00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:55,770
just made of papier seems like our

00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:59,190
anymore so nobody service talking pcs

00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:00,180
modules to play them and you know he

00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,450
thought they could do a little bit

00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:06,840
better than that

00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:08,310
so that said this entire together we

00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,820
have everything to be able to find it

00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:14,450
yet so we decided like we just generate

00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:18,140
every close when we create a new service

00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:20,640
so I just have a very small level here

00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:23,340
starts off my user could be the dough

00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:26,040
press it could be a BP but then he's

00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,500
running the test fail they run a Java

00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:32,250
Jenkins life generates a couple git

00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,670
repos that was happy his files and

00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:36,220
eighty files in there

00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:39,790
see here want the service want to the

00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:41,700
manifest want their territory those all

00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:44,200
pretty divine just what we said before

00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,980
number time that's what else all the

00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,930
time perhaps

00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,900
they all have objects so we put health

00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,250
checks on a clean place they come to us

00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,260
and they're like oh all our secrets are

00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,329
just checking it in plain text area

00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,940
polling places so that we can get them

00:52:55,329 --> 00:53:00,910
in there we have a competitive Senate

00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,980
fest we have our care for self so the

00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:06,309
creationists are just what we mentioned

00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:08,770
the war it defines our ingress advisor

00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:12,040
for the practice certificate the Vice

00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:15,099
Network policies it defines and anything

00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,119
that community management so once they

00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:18,010
think they all know who those are

00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:21,970
created they automatically get picked up

00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:25,599
by Dickens or senator or her party in

00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:27,130
this case with the DB models so you can

00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,599
see here those who thought the other

00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:31,510
night they go to our little pipeline

00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,400
which is kind of simplify here than just

00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:37,750
took one of chickens pushing to take off

00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,760
or potentially locally the spinnaker or

00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:43,329
even gain to just by our level comments

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:45,010
vinegar so you can see for our services

00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:47,200
tickets bills that was published in

00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:49,990
Canada came from our communities

00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,940
manifest G also builds validates some

00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:54,309
stuff what are those which you can clean

00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,960
trigger stick or a left hook and then

00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:59,309
prepare a plumber just easy to get wet

00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,290
folks there so at that point

00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:03,760
everything's in stagger your dad's don't

00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:06,319
really need to care about the center

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,270
easier

00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:11,760
for itself and you can see they actually

00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,890
point it out basically taking two packs

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,359
whether it's the Carini's mimics piece

00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:18,059
of the surface or a terrible piece of

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:21,059
the service and you can see they are on

00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:23,430
the side every image there is something

00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:25,740
we neither use currently or no

00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:29,520
everything is subways currently deployed

00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:31,829
by either kubernetes are careful and if

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,839
you can't you can't buy the third one

00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:35,789
provider to support that's while you're

00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,799
using that are not that difficult to

00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:42,500
write there's plenty of documentation

00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:45,779
right so what next

00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:48,660
we've improved a lot of things but we're

00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:51,240
still extremely immature like we started

00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,740
from the worst possible case in our that

00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,900
case when we black we can actually start

00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:57,690
doing interesting things so we've got a

00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,849
snowball effect now that makes it happen

00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,920
extremely quickly we can continue the

00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:03,029
allow the bible's libraries take

00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,299
advantage of these features as

00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:08,339
developers want to use Mary Alice's and

00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:10,140
already on the metrics in place of

00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:11,819
Solace we can get those at easily and

00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,730
when we have to take that they'll apply

00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:16,589
across all our applications a little

00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,750
more isn't it big options like I said

00:55:16,589 --> 00:55:22,319
with a very minimal state oh do you have

00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:24,510
a help check do you have to bake that

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,359
this will shut down but we can go

00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:29,849
further say all right you want the

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,580
poster in this all right will spawn an

00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:34,430
ACME store that configure

00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:37,760
all and Doral erratically configure to

00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:40,130
be available with an equivalent test

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,680
environments so because I think it's a

00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:44,180
terrible everything is in kubernetes we

00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,240
can easily make a pipeline that a

00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:50,210
developer can trigger to run all these

00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:53,000
kind of place execute some testamentary

00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:57,140
go back down and last any kind of trick

00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,090
qualitative into our document so here we

00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,990
put everything in place so they have to

00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,520
do anything at all

00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:04,430
initially which is really the biggest

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:07,330
barrier like we have tons of the link

00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:10,010
will use the relic these squad can use

00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:13,550
more than I can maybe a little bit of

00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,140
time yeah we need to train another home

00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:18,580
that because we need to be able to have

00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:22,900
them copy those and you know revolution

00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,900
that is thank you

00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:26,510
[Applause]

00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:35,840
so we have a lot of these cases that we

00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:38,500
happen in really I mean the disability

00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:42,440
also because coverage like Home Depot

00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:44,990
method etc right they all have one thing

00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,390
in common and that's obviously how to

00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:49,400
keep spinnaker up and running with a

00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:54,380
high-society you can think about right

00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:56,030
so I'm going to talk directly on before

00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:58,430
you actually think about the production

00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:01,640
you have to secure the system right and

00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:05,140
what are the most important things are

00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:08,600
you trying to introduce in animal cells

00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:10,670
as such so first of all we need to have

00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,050
a precision and a dedication and a

00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:14,870
compositional thinking I was just

00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:16,610
listening people say like you know if

00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:18,230
you drop me into spinnaker they can

00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:20,240
actually mess over the other people's

00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,310
application and that's not obviously we

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:26,510
need to control that we need enforced

00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:28,070
yet and we're working our doctors need

00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:30,200
to keep track of all the operation

00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,970
changes we need to know exactly to make

00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,980
the change we were to drive that

00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:36,020
operational support we don't want to go

00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,730
on jump people to sustain and make

00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:41,860
changes and other actor at the Royal

00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,860
emotional text we wanna make it bigger

00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:46,430
between micro-services this is one of

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,020
they have apartments to go to pollution

00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:52,940
we have happened here listening

00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:55,790
obviously we have two end points the yjp

00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:58,910
actually need media listed as well so

00:57:55,790 --> 00:58:00,800
this is practically one very first thing

00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:04,360
that you do but it's important to

00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:06,830
actually technically in the session

00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:09,080
meeting triple the data in the press

00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:10,760
whether these customers information on

00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:16,520
offices we talked about way back we

00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:19,490
still intention of those factors their

00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:22,490
secrets right politics and on the never

00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:24,290
be the part but yes don't keep asserted

00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:27,470
that so we need to put in an chicken

00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:32,870
crime also what every other km assistant

00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:35,240
image mega devices liabilities so I had

00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:39,110
a lot of people here dragons net already

00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:41,960
introduction I have news for you so our

00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:45,380
stance that reported six four seven

00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:48,650
critical vulnerabilities 35% on spirit

00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:50,890
and representative so this is particular

00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:54,580
to start with all these vulnerabilities

00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:58,280
we did this test without refrigeration

00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:59,930
1:16 I need to double-check but there's

00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,590
still so many we'll have abilities that

00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:05,810
we need to get all over and finally

00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:08,510
everything that is introduced needs to

00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:10,280
be signed and validated right so we have

00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:12,260
basic things were actually training

00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:16,400
architectures together they need to be

00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:18,440
verified now what is it secure which

00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:22,369
seems to be very simple right now we go

00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:25,250
to the particular X it's written that

00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:27,500
depending on just one pound standard but

00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,360
you need to have identified man you need

00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,640
to have another camera performance this

00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,230
environment chipper right here's one

00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:38,060
goes about this to be different you

00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:40,400
don't want me servicing and Jing Boran

00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:44,180
old formation and declaration and then

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,770
you have one of the canoes like an apple

00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,200
and everywhere the connection

00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:50,270
you never do things in separate so you

00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,820
need to have a way to go ultimately I

00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:55,910
never take deployments and that's what

00:59:52,820 --> 01:00:01,490
spirit is just a bunch of micro services

00:59:55,910 --> 01:00:04,310
with a poncho and all the things they

01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:06,470
need a break to be CITV as well so why

01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:08,610
don't you have spinnaker respect so you

01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,410
can actually use

01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:12,300
and that's a bit something that be

01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:17,760
natural and then I have got a beautiful

01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:20,700
slightly simpler if you will end up

01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,470
having more than one instance for any

01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,960
reason so place the things that you want

01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:27,630
to do and I want to provide services you

01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:32,780
know one thing and that's working so

01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:35,570
crazy and and all this will have helped

01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:38,340
we should say you have a tradition

01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:41,070
having a defining the to wrestle a right

01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:43,530
we have all these Mac services right

01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:46,080
that's called an what is that without an

01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:49,140
average what is just the Fonz

01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,760
invitation-only stir that pot so there's

01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:53,040
a lot of things we need to do in this

01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,900
field I mean it's great to be coming

01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,360
together to community and he's obviously

01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:01,890
on the field or grain field that

01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:03,600
actually we need to look into this

01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,670
because this also preparation planning

01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,980
is right configuration has a cold

01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,240
you don't wanna have someone to mess up

01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,670
with your spinning of thing right

01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:15,000
besides the LCR pen you need to keep

01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:17,160
track of all these changes we need to

01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,560
play around or stable structurally guys

01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:23,250
you wanna accidentally when I put roles

01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,099
and effects sometimes there is different

01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,499
things where

01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:28,900
this is method development Christine and

01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:30,579
as hurricanes so they need to understand

01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,219
what we're doing so you need to break

01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:35,440
this taste we are employing the same

01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:37,299
thing over the place why not start

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,559
sharing all those things together as a

01:01:37,299 --> 01:01:42,219
community as a reference architecture in

01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:45,789
the uplands

01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:48,339
where I'm so I think that one of the

01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:51,339
people to the Nexus 10 acre summit is to

01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:54,729
talk more about these things and I will

01:01:51,339 --> 01:02:06,269
pop into a little bit of use of the New

01:01:54,729 --> 01:02:20,019
York nationalism this is actually so yes

01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:22,269
we actually have so we said shaft we

01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:25,059
have a connector for 14 and reactive all

01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:26,130
this is very important for us we can

01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:29,349
work it out

01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:33,369
mostly over the wrong path so 40 new

01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:35,829
features without the help of my friends

01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:38,319
in anything right so coming to be the

01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:40,569
leaders not just followers need one to

01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:43,690
participate in future developers know

01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:47,400
those things for other people come

01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:50,529
together I'd representation insecurity

01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,359
craters and the six-week aperture plane

01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:58,380
which is the messenger and we have to

01:02:53,359 --> 01:03:17,510
these two new at six let me our

01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:17,510
respective communities being this is

01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,829
actually the operators of see this is

01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,859
that we are actually three people to

01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:45,180
actually join this effort we actually

01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:48,440
who make speaker super robust system in

01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:51,569
median for so this is this man was ready

01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:54,630
thanks so much time if you didn't attend

01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:57,480
a chat session yesterday was amazing in

01:03:54,630 --> 01:04:00,750
factually library the Buddha traditional

01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,849
spinnaker and actually fifteen minutes

01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:05,339
and deeper guard astronaut the

01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:08,160
solidified everything about the mission

01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:10,970
taking so I will go to the drug dosage

01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,970
thank you so much

01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:20,700
