	00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,320
we started spinnaker probably about six

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:16,320
years ago to replace another open sore

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,060
called Asgard and Asgard had a healthy

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,140
community and so we knew that if we were

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,910
going to build something to replace

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,369
Asgard we had to bring that community

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,310
along with us so the first key thing is

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,930
that spinnaker is backwards or at the

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,759
time was backwards compatible with

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,690
Asgard because Asgard would mix or

00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:36,600
Asgard would push certain opinions upon

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,340
your infrastructure and if you pointed

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,070
spinnaker at it it would recognize those

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,390
opinions and so that was one way to

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,010
ensure the continuity of a community

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,630
that was already using let's say open

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,310
source from Netflix I mean the other

00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,420
thing that helped a lot in terms of

00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,680
building a strong community is that we

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,480
partnered with a number of companies

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,540
before open sourcing it one of them

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,720
being Google but also pivotal Microsoft

00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,630
and a couple of other companies like

00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,310
Target and Veritas so we had not only

00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,769
Netflix but some other really amazing

00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,780
companies that were adding features into

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,509
spinnaker so that once we open sourced

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,490
it to the you know the world so to speak

00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:13,979
out of the gate spinnaker work with AWS

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,899
and it worked with a Microsoft Azure and

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:20,190
it worked with a Google cloud platform

00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:21,840
and so and then embodied in spinnaker

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,729
were a number of opinions in terms of

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,130
how to do obviously continuous delivery

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,520
but the idea of pipelines with automated

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,650
canary analysis with deployment patterns

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,180
like we call them red black but the rest

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,860
of the world calls them blue green all

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,010
those things embodied into a platform

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,650
that could also call Jenkins jobs be

00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,729
triggered off of Jenkins jobs I think

00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,720
created this groundswell where the

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,159
community could actually start

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,350
leveraging this platform and then start

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,270
giving back to it and that innovation

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,270
has just continued and so that's why now

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,150
we have like you said you know community

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,119
members here tonight from over 22

00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,979
different countries in fact a number of

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,380
them are actually active committers in

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,380
spinnaker which is just super exciting

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,480
community for me is innovation so

00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,400
there's there's obviously a community

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,190
within Netflix but I think a broader

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,340
open-source community what it really

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,750
equals for all of us is innovation and a

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,060
healthy community is an engaged

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,370
community that can obviously get

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,910
questions answered and and also answer

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,050
those questions but also can extend and

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,910
build let's say things on top of

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,620
spinnaker and that community actually

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,600
doesn't even need to be solely open

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,370
source as I pointed out there are plenty

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,290
of commercial companies also building on

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,330
top of spinnaker so community is this

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,460
idea of different corporations and

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,560
people adding value into this ecosystem

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,810
which equals innovation both for Netflix

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,550
but also for everyone in the community

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,170
and the innovation can take the form of

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,060
new features like I was elaborating in

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,040
terms of you know customized support and

00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:00,290
kubernetes but it could also take the

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,690
the form of bug fixes or videos or you

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,790
know documentation enhancements and that

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,170
creates this idea of like anyone in the

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,030
community can get involved we're trying

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,500
to be very much inclusive but at the end

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,209
of the day for me a community really is

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,130
all about innovation and the more

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,350
healthy and engaged community is like

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,560
the more everyone gets something out of

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,560
it

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,280
yeah this this community from the

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,099
standpoint of its diverse and amazing

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,660
and there's so many different let's say

00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:32,129
corporations and domains representative

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,709
with this community and when I think

00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:38,040
about my career one of the most exciting

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,890
times previous to Netflix is when I had

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,540
my own company and I had a team of

00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,310
people and we were consulting to a

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,440
number of corporations across the globe

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,269
whether they be financial services

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,940
healthcare independent software vendors

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,890
and what was fascinating and influential

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,840
for me is that while each one of those

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,630
companies where corporations had a

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,610
different let's say business model they

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,310
all wanted the same thing and the idea

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,870
at the time we were espousing was like

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,180
better better software faster in terms

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,799
of like testing but it's all kind of

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,470
manifest in this idea of continuous

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,209
delivery in terms of any company out

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,790
there whether you're Netflix Google or a

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,010
small start-up you have to move fast

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,769
because if you don't you'll be beaten by

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,790
someone who's faster than you and and

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,850
there's another thing I'd like to add on

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,130
that is that this community also mirrors

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,830
the the notion of like always learning

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,590
this community is growing and trying new

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,240
things and and is also not afraid to try

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,060
something new so like the whole idea of

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,410
like the governance policy wins beniker

00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,389
it's not like any of us had vast

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,950
experience in terms of formalizing

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,690
governance and figuring out how to do

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,340
technical oversight committees and

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,470
steering committees we're all learning

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,080
this together and I think this is a

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:52,470
learning community and very much I think

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,330
mirrors my my career in anyone's career

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,430
if you want to be successful or at least

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,830
not stagnate you have to continue

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,470
learning and I also believe every

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,270
corporation out there who who wants to

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,380
move fast also us to recognize that they

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,639
have to be a learning corporation

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,080
because they will be they will be beat

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,580
by some other corporation who learns

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,880
faster than them so I think it's all

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,880
interrelated

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:22,410
I think there is a strong core

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:27,410
with let's say peace of mind and ability

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:30,840
to think clearly with whether it be

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,120
exercise prayer meditation mindfulness

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,070
all these things you know yoga all those

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,110
all those things I think are all

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,690
interrelated or similar in the sense of

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,040
it's it's it's me time or you time

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,570
whatever it's time alone where you can

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,770
start to think it's the same as like

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,970
taking a long shower people are like

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:50,730
Eureka I had this great idea in the

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:52,770
shower I think for me racing is two

00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,150
things one it's the time just to think

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,280
by myself whether I'm running or

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,420
swimming around a bike I usually end up

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,010
spending a lot of time thinking about

00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,660
like this the community Netflix a lot

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,770
about Netflix in terms of you know

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,450
where's my team going to I have the

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,600
right team are we are we doing the right

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:12,330
things but I also think it's a it's

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,740
definitely a stress reliever regardless

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,390
if you know you work at Netflix or any

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,740
company there there is a level of stress

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:23,370
specially you know the technology

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,810
challenges I think are easy because it's

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,420
usually binary like there's a problem

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,760
let's solve it people problems or people

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:33,270
challenges are a lot more difficult and

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,690
nuanced people aren't you know on or off

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:40,020
and so I think that adds to I think just

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,910
stress in general and so I feel strongly

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,980
that anyone in a leadership position

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,780
should have some sort of outlet whether

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,000
it be exercise or you know prayer

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,670
meditation all those things I think you

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,990
need that to both think but also just

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,990
like let the stress off

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,850
I hope this community can a to grow and

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,250
that and as I said earlier community is

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,290
innovation so I would love to see in

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,960
continued innovation that has been the

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,760
eye-opener for me both within Netflix

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,550
but also in their larger community is

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,660
that when you create a purr when you

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,160
create a platform that people can

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,320
innovate on you learn so many

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,540
interesting things when we set out to

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,100
build spinnaker you know we largely had

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,630
blinders on in that we wanted to solve a

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,860
very specific problem that was server

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:31,260
side AWS ec2 deployments and even on

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,060
Netflix we saw innovations in terms of

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,760
people using spinnaker for feature flags

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,410
or for firmware delivery or for even

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,030
library management and then you're

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,229
seeing those innovations obvious in the

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,150
open source world where they're doing

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:44,430
amazing things with kubernetes adding

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,870
all sorts of new features many of which

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,330
we're trying to use at Netflix and some

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,310
of them we can't but I think ultimately

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,410
what I see for the future of spinnaker

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,539
is a very very vibrant community that

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,180
continues to innovate try new things is

00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:59,160
always learning and it's not afraid also

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,830
to you know back out of something when

00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,889
we learn that this doesn't work but I I

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,020
want to see and hope you know that the

00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,849
trajectory Ron continues and I think it

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,870
does from the standpoint of having an

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,789
engaged community and a healthy

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,340
community that can extend spinnaker can

00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,930
get involved easily with overall

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,020
governance and so all these things that

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,520
we're putting effort into I believe will

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,240
only continue to make this a more

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,240
healthy community

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:33,610
because it's the best so there are

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:39,910
certainly other alternatives spinnaker

00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:41,980
and it's great in that Netflix does not

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,630
have a horse in that race per se like we

00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,310
don't get anything let's say

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,440
commercially out of let's say a company

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,060
choosing to use spinnaker what we do go

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,680
what we do get though is innovation so

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,030
we want that but there are a number of

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,970
choices out there I think with respect

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,870
to spinnaker what makes it special two

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,040
primary things one not only is it a a

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,600
continuous delivery platform but it also

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,310
does the infrastructure management

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,680
aspect and I think a lot of the

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,810
platforms out there today they focus on

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,760
let's say orchestrating delivery but

00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,440
then there's the whole you know once

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,910
I've gotten something into production

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
which is very important and very nuanced

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,000
in terms of all the validation want to

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,260
do before you get to production but once

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,620
it's there what are gonna do with it you

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,880
have to maintain it observe it do all

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,200
the things that are infrastructure

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,490
management and spinnaker allows you to

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,020
do that so I think that's a really big

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,730
value add that I think a number of

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,380
people overlook and I mean the other

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,930
thing is that spinnaker embodies very

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,490
strong opinions that work I'm a classic

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,310
one is a you know Bluegreen deployment

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,860
but there's Highlander we have monitored

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,660
deployments so rolling red black or I

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,400
guess what we'd say they would be called

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,330
rollin blue green deployments which I

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,330
don't think the industry is really

00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:49,450
talking about and so these are patterns

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,390
that you get for free from spinnaker you

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,140
know and and you could of course

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,490
implement these patterns on other

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,830
platforms but they you know they would

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,000
take a whole lot of effort a whole lot

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,580
of calls and you get it for free when

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,080
spinnaker and I think lastly it goes

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,810
back to basically everything I've been

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,160
talking about with you is the community

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,960
and innovation this is a really strong

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,570
community you have the actual cloud

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,700
providers themselves adding features

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:16,540
under spinnaker like AWS and Microsoft

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,040
and Google and pivotal they are they are

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,170
adding native features you know if you

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,390
will into spinnaker to support their

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,320
platforms and that's pretty amazing if

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,530
you think about it from a support

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,440
standpoint like AWS added lamb to

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,170
support in this vinegar and so not only

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,670
you know you have someone like AWS in

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,080
the ecosystem but their developers know

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,580
this system better than anyone else and

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,650
they can help you know in terms of

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,510
maintaining the AWS cloud provider but

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,720
also you know answering questions the

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,110
one

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,090
so I think it's again there are other

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,180
you know choices out there and I think a

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,440
lot of them are fabulous and if to your

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,330
question why spinnaker it's

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,520
infrastructure management is something

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,750
people overlook just the innovation

00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,190
within the community and then this

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,190
embodiment of opinions

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,570
so there are probably a billion things

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,910
that I wish I knew then which I know now

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,610
I would say the one and this was asked

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,940
me recently is uh and this is more of a

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:21,180
let's say from a Netflix standpoint but

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:24,050
saying no I didn't say no enough and

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:28,290
that I think gets us all into trouble i

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,730
I think if I had said no more often

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,410
let's say in the beginning I think we

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,300
may have been further along on a number

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,730
of strategic efforts because we we went

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,340
down paths that you know may or may not

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,210
have been the most high leverage thing

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,150
we could have been doing but we've

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:44,040
learned from that so and I think with

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,640
respect to the community

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,020
probably even which saying no is

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,760
something certainly in the community

00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:57,750
although I think engaging more if I had

00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:02,550
done that more in the beginning I think

00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:05,280
in retrospect let's say me and my team's

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,320
involvement and open source could have

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,910
we've done a lot but we could have done

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,770
a lot more and we're trying to do a lot

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,160
more now because we didn't do a lot you

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:17,730
know in the beginning so be saying no

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:21,110
and not under estimating the level of

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,110
effort to create a vibrant community

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:31,160
[Laughter]

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,160
