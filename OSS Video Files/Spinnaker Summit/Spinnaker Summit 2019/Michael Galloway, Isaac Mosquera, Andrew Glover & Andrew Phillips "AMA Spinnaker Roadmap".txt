the good thing is that if something has

00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:14,469
a name next to it you can be pretty sure

00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:17,710
that the suit is going to be working on

00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:21,039
it and of course the other thing is the

00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,480
robot isn't finished or done you know we

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,009
continue to be open it's on us though

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,320
because something is out there it says

00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,960
h1 2020 on it it means nothing else

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,059
should come on deck like of course

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,610
please roll let's talk about that it's a

00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,739
danger to you that's a living vibe it's

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,230
a living set of ideas a living set of

00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:43,800
living set of principles and now that

00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,800
motor is here no I will let you out

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,730
these illustrious people have given

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,250
their their introduction so I guess

00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:13,299
we'll go from there I wanted to start

00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:14,950
with what are be actually oh yeah I was

00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,959
mainly discussing that we want to go

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,429
through and update things like put SIG's

00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,859
as owners on there versus having

00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:22,950
companies as owners but I've been very I

00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:26,229
haven't talked or buy anything to dinner

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:32,649
so it's still a secret yeah let's let's

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:34,060
start there so why don't we go down the

00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:35,549
line and just talk through some of the

00:01:34,060 --> 00:02:07,820
major initiatives

00:01:35,549 --> 00:02:07,820
well first of all there are okay

00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:45,109
the community and so yeah this is

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:25,039
and again if you go to the road I

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:28,430
thought I haven't touched much about the

00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:29,210
axis about we're gonna do that these are

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,740
all the higher-level

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,289
fairies and I think that is some one

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,300
intentional because what's on there as

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:37,699
there was a good eternal feature that

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,319
he's open to discussion and open to

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,819
community includes of course there are

00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,949
some obvious things but they don't like

00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:45,020
how the pipeline's were sort of teachers

00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,509
who were there the purpose is more I

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,189
think the goal and he grew up through

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,900
the technical oversight committees and

00:04:49,189 --> 00:05:00,860
the very SIG's as what we have a

00:04:50,900 --> 00:05:05,479
governance and community structure so

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:08,120
are working with large new price

00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:13,029
companies in racing spinning over the

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:15,349
past two years even today the the whole

00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:18,229
sequence of install configure and

00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:20,449
operators still a problem and we often

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,150
see those challenges when we help

00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:26,300
companies about the spinnaker so a lot

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,430
of our focus now is on making it easiest

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,659
and he was saying to them opposite by

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,479
spinnaker with the new kubernetes

00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:35,150
Buster's so we're building great

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,060
operator that has it doesn't just

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,550
install it it also has a lot of

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,469
validation that happens reinstallation

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,009
of post installation which is where a

00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:47,930
lot of companies to charge us with so

00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,120
then after you install configure and

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,610
operates what's next the next part is

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,229
onboarding and that is again the big

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,900
challenge for many companies is how do

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:59,569
we move hundreds of our legacy or

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,979
existing applications onto spinnaker

00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,319
some of those things may not be

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,750
computerized and so there's a whole

00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,820
gamut of challenges there a lot of

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,060
companies work with

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,060
[Music]

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:18,940
there were the UPS extra a lot of

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,860
companies who work with they come up

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,800
with pretty crafty solutions to solve

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,110
the awarding problems we would like to

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,440
find a way to generalize it obviously

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,200
with the community and really make it

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,570
easy for companies to migrate their

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,450
existing applications on the server so I

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:41,260
know many of you here have created

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:43,030
custom user experiences and custom

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,980
interfaces that set up those spinnaker

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,340
just to make it simpler and easier for

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:53,290
people to home port so it love to kind

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:55,810
of here so the next area that we're

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,850
focusing on is how can we bring more

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,940
companies into the spinnaker ecosystem

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,220
and so we're building a plug-in system

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,919
or plugin framework that enables you to

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,480
plug in they'll create plug-ins for

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,070
other systems of record where they're

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,390
it's some systems that you've built

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,650
internally or it's you know existing

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,380
existing tools and existing services

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:20,430
like the Gira's the ServiceNow other

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,830
systems about sit in the path of

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,910
developers being able to ship code in

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,400
organization which will be done we find

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,600
those to be the bottlenecks how do we

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,729
integrate all the things to the

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,160
spinnaker spinnaker being a single thing

00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:35,229
of glass and if I can't easily integrate

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,240
those systems my workflow doesn't work

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:39,520
because they all sit in the path of

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,070
actually successfully shipping software

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,600
in its companies so those are kind of

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,580
the key things that we're trying to

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,950
tackle in our way because those are the

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,780
things that

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:54,370
those are the things are preventing them

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,990
from being successful and after that the

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,310
you know that it's kind of a community

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,090
project what we're working on with

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,740
Google is how do we collect metrics

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,110
about what is happening within the

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,450
community and anonymizing exposing to

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,860
everybody so together as a community we

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,400
can actually improve a lot of the states

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,260
and do some you know data-driven product

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,500
development which is not really possible

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:22,810
today for the project just as a quick

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:34,229
show of hands how many of you have

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:40,060
integrated I figured that your company's

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:41,320
probably not so as a result of some of

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,540
the conversations have already happened

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,400
up here Netflix is going to be investing

00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,100
quite a lot in improving that plug-in

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,900
and extendibility story we've already

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,630
been working on areas around stages and

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,520
small expression functions but there is

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,010
a lot of work we're doing with armory

00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,410
directly on creating a more

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:02,410
sophisticated plug-in framework the idea

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,420
with that is exactly the point we want

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,940
to make we want to make a spinnaker

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,770
sticky we have a lot of internal tools

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,510
at Netflix as well that we do any rate

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:15,390
that it's vinegar in with

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,930
not being able to do so very effectively

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,000
makes it difficult for it to extend and

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,090
have the full impact well certainly this

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,820
means we want to enable building of

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,170
communities of practice even within

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,850
networks but of course within the rest

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,620
of the community within every company

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,160
that is using spinnaker you should be

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,080
able to enable your other teams to

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,300
connect spinnaker its assistance and

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,010
tools they like to use doing that

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,360
Netflix is actually a lot of us to use

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,980
spinnaker four deployments and things

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,610
like firmware on our of the connect

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:52,110
appliances like fast properties which is

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:54,690
our own internal feature feature plyuk

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,120
system so it's really critical for I

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,930
think the success is vinegar as a as a

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,370
project in addition to that we are very

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:07,290
mindful that you probably all have

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,260
frustrations around the API because it

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:15,030
needs a lot of work in terms of making

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,520
it more accessible better documented so

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:19,370
we're going to be investing a lot in the

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,380
generation of auto generation of

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:25,650
information from configuration as well

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:30,120
as some some additional improvements

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:31,080
that make it possible so those are part

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,180
of what we've been terming as

00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,240
Spinnaker's platform within delivering

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,440
engineering and netflix other

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,480
improvements that we're looking at are

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,980
things like multi location so active

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,850
active or high

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,180
this is an issue for us and I'm sure for

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,790
many many folks as well in the community

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,380
and another initiative to call out is

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,690
what we're calling right now is multi

00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,450
out experience we found that a lot of

00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:01,110
teams and Netflix are interested in

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,640
having a way to visualize their

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,260
applications and related infrastructure

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,430
more efficiently from a lot of the

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,870
conversations that I've had with folks

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:12,000
here as well at the summit this is a non

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,530
this is a common problem where you might

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,930
have multiple applications that relate

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,240
to each other that a team is managing

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,240
and they want a better way to see all of

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,730
those applications and how they relate

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,310
within its vinegar so there are some

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,430
initiatives that we're working on to to

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,820
support that and of course the big one

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:36,600
that I think we've mentioned it once or

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:39,420
twice is managed delivery and there is a

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,560
good article I'll put out about it

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,920
hopefully just to give a high-level

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,330
understanding of what it is the progress

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,370
for managed to lose a goal with managed

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:53,040
delivery is over 2020 we will be rolling

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,650
that out to many applications inside of

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,050
Netflix so we already have it in place

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,290
for a few applications select alpha

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,960
doctors and q1 to q2 we'll be expanding

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:07,110
that quite broadly across Netflix and

00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:13,560
into more business critical systems on

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:17,450
the later first half of 2020 to early q3

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:21,650
so the hope is that as we

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:24,260
with that technology and engage with all

00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,840
of you we've had some conversations we

00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,450
really love to involve as many folks in

00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,710
the community and in that effort because

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,140
there's quite a lot of fantastic

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,630
opportunities work that can be done that

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,540
can benefit all of us so our hope is to

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:55,700
continue those conversations with

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:58,060
everybody so I think you elaborated on

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:07,730
some gaps within the spinnaker

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:11,090
system install experience in the

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:17,380
spinnaker are there additional gaps that

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,380
aren't being filled by the way

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,430
that way I think one of the things that

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,610
we had the discussion during session one

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,320
of the things that as we as we evolved

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:53,170
in this government's home one of the

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:54,700
things we eat oh I think about what are

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,339
we trying to go for that this market is

00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,750
going many different places I try to

00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,490
talk about some themes that I think

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,709
they're pretty big right now whose faces

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:09,010
you party the party was just the

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:10,959
developers our strategies whichever path

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,730
rotates it is basically kinda tell us

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,320
when I'm trying to roll out big data

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,000
multiples like right before the global

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,250
site focus you know save those

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,640
complications like each one of these

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:26,050
questions brings with it I think most of

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,930
the stuff that we just talked about

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:32,529
these understandably somewhat short term

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:34,510
I think what we also want to do first

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,730
off of this series to develop I think a

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,180
feature for that star so that when it

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,180
comes to

00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:54,809
yeah I think we've covered it a bit

00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,670
about the operating experience of

00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:00,290
spinnaker and Coburn Eddie's with others

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:05,189
whole developer experience committees

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:07,139
work I think we have currently a solid

00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:09,179
plan put forward but there's definitely

00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,850
a lot of improvements there happening in

00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,509
the user interface we're talking about

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,769
digital leveraging tectonic forces

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:19,739
tration so there's there's definitely

00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:21,660
more loose ages to be hot there we have

00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:22,980
some ideas but everybody in the

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,470
community obvious is welcome to

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:32,009
participate figure out with Gigi was

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:35,369
like I'm going to echo the comments

00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:39,689
around areas that we would love to see

00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:41,730
improved in spinnaker enables kinds of

00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:44,759
deployment when they are in it or

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:48,149
delivery rather one area that is kind of

00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,610
a big gap is a story right stateful

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:53,220
delivery that's a common need that

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,709
arises and many organizations have to

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,410
come up with their own ways us included

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:01,619
in solving that and I feel like we could

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,410
do better there frankly arrogantly

00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:08,100
I think is is an area that we absolutely

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:10,169
to be spending more time on this is both

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,410
developers really the whole conversation

00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:16,769
around operations and metrics help but

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:19,410
how best understand what what went wrong

00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:24,049
both is not radar and as a developer I

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,049
think we can do a lot better there

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,660
[Music]

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,400
our plans are to listen to you have an

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:49,470
exactly right this would be zero you'll

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:54,820
see online use to be obvious which is

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:58,090
focused on setup using UI and so on as

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:02,040
we get more validation that people from

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,040
a programmatic interaction with vinegar

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:09,970
where's the developer want to get that

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:12,880
they really want to go to he's not major

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:16,059
whatever as you develop your picture who

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,110
are the stables to be it makes total

00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:22,300
sense to suggest can we get like one

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:25,030
with statistics card logs all kinds of

00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,800
things like that in this fancy I don't

00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,990
think it's conceptually limited to

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,510
ceremony so yes I think that definitely

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,090
fits within the picture of that another

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:37,090
similar potentially interesting idea of

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,530
other tools it seems like a UI snippet

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:43,600
or a button you can include your

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:49,530
comments in we are showing the spinnaker

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,530
pipeline for instance or whatever just

00:18:51,120 --> 00:19:00,070
know back to you gives an offensive

00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,900
scope and I think we all know how do

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:08,140
developers interact with their delivery

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:12,610
flow what are the right ways to keep us

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:15,130
back to the question belongs that

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:30,360
deserves to be a top level heading for

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:30,360
h2 we work with a lot of companies and

00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:36,390
its larger

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:39,429
rule 2000 is still in datacenters and

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,320
they're still using very ancient ways of

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:45,309
developing things they're still really

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,380
keen on web interfaces and so we're

00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,530
trying to find ways to simplify their

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,540
journey and

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,180
a balloon tell doubts to like spinnaker

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,530
faster so we kind of have to in in

00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,140
certain case we have to meet that where

00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,090
they are rather than prescribing some on

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,980
the waves of balloon thanks and meet the

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,650
we're meeting with tools that they're

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:11,320
already familiar with so to explain

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:11,320
earlier this could be the combination to

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,069
[Music]

00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,529
[Applause]

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,770
[Music]

00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,620
even three of you want to take that and

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:07,460
the answer can't be by the commercial

00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:09,200
Michael easy for me to start because

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,649
I've got the first four just to make

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,840
this work um yeah obviously the the

00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:17,360
point is clear that in our particular

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,139
part of the industry we have large great

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,240
lessons in how those new plugins

00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:24,289
obviously having a single process that

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,230
tries to fit everything when one

00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:31,309
classpath makes things hard so I think I

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,320
think there are some just plain

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,059
architectural advantages those but there

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,029
has over Jenkins if we're looking at

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:40,759
that as a comparative model that make

00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:45,590
puddings potentially less problematic

00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:47,059
certainly let's be honest Jenkins is a

00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,320
luxury position having two thousand

00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,869
pumpkins to compete with each other

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,669
doesn't make easy money it's a great

00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:55,039
place to be you know do the best

00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,450
that's that richer so I think in some

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,460
sense we're maybe also talk about the

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,100
future problem be a nice problem for us

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,450
to have I think some things in the

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,840
pattern in this industry that will make

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,799
it easier and plugin is a complicated

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,749
word here because you could imagine

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,299
plugging things into spinnaker in so

00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:13,220
many different places I will let others

00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:16,070
talk a little bit about specifically the

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,139
areas they are thinking about for me one

00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,539
of the most obvious places that

00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:23,929
spinnaker deserves better probability is

00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:25,369
in stages you want to have a stage to

00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,869
connect to foobar rather than the

00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:31,879
service back in Colo mainframe the thing

00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:33,110
and that's a cheap hard right now there

00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:34,190
are a couple of different flavors are

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,809
doing evil which have different

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:41,520
requirements a zone that I hope is in

00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:43,260
easily and safely because you're running

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,600
on top of a container rights for a type

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,279
system basically calling a container

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,740
that can have its own dependencies that

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,779
have whatever actions it wants to be

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,970
apostate a' - including secrets and

00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:55,980
things like that that should be really

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,970
easily do and that should be doable with

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,770
that i'm going to change or without

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,140
dependencies all this stuff that's an

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,480
area of extensibility that jenkins can

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,820
easily do that keep spinnaker heads and

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,950
any other container runner system can

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,080
easily do when we start talking about

00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,029
terms like why extensions or things like

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,919
you know making providers more lovable

00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:18,690
obviously we start to get much closer to

00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,820
the guts of the system if you like and

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,380
that is where there will clearly be

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,919
engineering challenges as we talked

00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,390
about last month know i have some i hear

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,149
what the plans are in that area but i'm

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:37,740
the deferred to people who actually know

00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:40,110
better as far as the plugins and how

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:44,149
we're currently trying to grow the

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,149
ecosystems by partnering with companies

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,919
to create plugins for example companies

00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:55,200
like the idea would be that they were

00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,090
actually making this plugins or at they

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,679
know thanks we'll see how that works out

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:04,740
that that's gonna current path we we

00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:06,659
armory recently hired a partnerships

00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,850
partnerships person and so this person

00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:11,399
is going out and talking to all of the

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:14,720
companies in the it steals ecosystem

00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:14,720
trying to bring them to the table

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,089
[Music]

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:07,330
[Laughter]

00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:16,539
so there are other stakeholders in the

00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:19,629
ecosystem not represented on this panel

00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:26,409
and Microsoft is one of them and so I

00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:30,100
will speak to the that's a great request

00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:33,490
so it's really that team to prioritize I

00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:36,460
think how we can answer this as a panel

00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:40,330
though is as a you know end-user or

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,970
again stakeholder community how do you

00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:46,539
bubble up these requests if I have

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:49,389
something for pivotal or Microsoft or I

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:52,890
have like a deep let's say within Orca

00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:54,600
and I want to see it you know reflected

00:27:52,890 --> 00:28:00,540
that was the process by essentially

00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:02,220
giving you three and others attention so

00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,320
I was I was going to just calm down me

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,850
there's some policies like I already an

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,840
employee of Google commenting on the

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:11,190
Microsoft I sure integration no the

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,990
reality is like I've been on your side

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:18,600
of this debate previous companies there

00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,370
are relative companies and contributors

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,750
in this very core system whose

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,090
contribution is international no

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,030
strategic or tactical that's a totally

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,770
legitimate thing to do I think

00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,809
historically Microsoft has been in that

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,809
class that's not to be critical of them

00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:36,360
in any way that makes a lot of sense

00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:38,010
legitimately the best way in my

00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,280
experience the best way to get a company

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:44,220
like that to engage you or rather you

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:47,280
say we have a commitment X and you know

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,250
we've got use it if we don't make to a

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,200
feature that's much easier you might

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,450
want them to get Microsoft on the table

00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,070
than it is for me like of course I can

00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,720
write a nice email to the Microsoft the

00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,669
end of this paper steering with the odd

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,410
man is he over there basic obviously not

00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:07,620
that simple but at the end of the day

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:10,290
customer demands wolf drying there's a

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,419
new integration so never be yummy

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,710
never be shiny if you like to follow

00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:16,200
that up yes of course

00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,030
if we have an issue of women as buying

00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,070
thumbs up or something like that or ten

00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:23,380
that is also great data that green

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:25,210
signal to someone from a potentially

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,370
this is actually something that might be

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:31,600
worth doing yeah the last panel we

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,700
talked about how you can raise issues

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,650
you know senator senator you could raise

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,870
this issue and then we'll be in

00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:40,179
effectively triage by a sig in this case

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,490
there is no Microsoft as your sig but we

00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,919
have plans to create one and so then

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,600
that would be essentially staffed by

00:29:44,919 --> 00:30:02,559
Microsoft developers and they could get

00:29:46,600 --> 00:30:07,140
that visibility so no does this fit

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:09,429
occur for Team C cloud provider

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,840
implementation abstraction or part of it

00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:15,700
meant that is to say is the goal that I

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,830
should be able as a customer or user of

00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,140
spinnaker to create a load balancer that

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,059
provided its table stakes basic

00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,270
functionality I don't have too many

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:28,630
custom coding or configuration to use

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,580
any supporting providers of basic load

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,590
balancing functionality and if I

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,909
deployed to three different providers to

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,130
be a spinnaker it would automatically

00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:41,520
take care of nuances in each behind the

00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:41,520
scenes it's a great question

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:21,500
so I would say in terms of resources

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,500
there is

00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,319
[Music]

00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,400
it's possible there can I just get a

00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:15,500
quick show he had so many of you are

00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,500
using more than one impression

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:26,669
certainly provides great no Elmo is part

00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:29,070
of the answer I think I think the notion

00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:30,600
of a multi cloud abstract change I would

00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,799
just summarize what you're talking about

00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,830
this what is I

00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,720
I have curious biases in this base I was

00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,429
on a member of the board of the Apache

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,909
Jay clubs project which strategy the

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:43,980
Java thing is a bunch of other Java

00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,720
libraries that try to do this but he

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,970
hates right that was a very interesting

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,230
time to ask this question because I

00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,639
think there's two data points that are

00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,990
kind of conflicting and we'll have to

00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:53,880
see how they play out and I think before

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,649
we can make a choice the one day

00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,330
deploying these that would be five years

00:32:55,649 --> 00:33:00,029
ago there was this genuine division that

00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:02,519
you abstractly talk about Vienna is a

00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:06,720
network of computer storage we just

00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,760
magically cross cross deploy or same

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,470
application across 12 clouds that didn't

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,419
matter you've seen plenty products in

00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,830
this space I think the reality you

00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,899
learned is that basically nobody does

00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,409
this I mean we have a very large the

00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:20,669
ways that is exactly this but in general

00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:22,590
multi-cloud usage as we've seen across

00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:24,090
companies typically means they run some

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,159
more looks on one cloud that some

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,360
workers on the other cloud to others as

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,889
pointers now let's have another show

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,320
about how many people are run the same

00:33:28,889 --> 00:33:33,690
application of multiple providers well

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,139
there's a few but I would say probably a

00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:39,450
fifth or 10 what we saw just now and

00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:41,820
that kind of makes the point I think for

00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,710
me I think that's the one direction in

00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,279
which like that is agreeing that that

00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,899
kind of vision has not made out and then

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,669
in the other direction of course we see

00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,260
a resurrection of that freaking sources

00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:54,510
with things like kubernetes because

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,799
arguably the dream now is if you want

00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,460
multi-plug you just run programs

00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,679
everywhere

00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,820
Google perspective that's a great thing

00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,769
to hear

00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,840
I think it's still very early days of

00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:05,970
class I feel very similarly to the way

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,850
we did fire five years ago we'll have to

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,010
see how

00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,770
and you know as we start to get some

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,599
more data out of this place out there be

00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,000
much easier to answer your question

00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:20,210
about whether there is genuinely value

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,770
in a crosstown abstraction or whether we

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:26,419
just need to support Cooper that is much

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:28,280
better or something else it's certainly

00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:30,109
worth noting that the direction we took

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,450
when we built senator was not to provide

00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,669
a common abstraction but to actually

00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,919
have a provider for each cloud C to take

00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:42,669
advantage of the individual features and

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:46,359
as Michael was alluding to and

00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:46,359
ostensibly we could

00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,880
maybe so much so my questions more

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,810
around the roadmap and around the

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,970
developer engagement so like whenever

00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,800
I'm trying to add a feature like the

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,510
spinnaker gauge or something right now

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,190
if you look at Salem getting set up a

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,640
spinnaker it's kind of like getting a

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:20,010
teen gate machine kids boot up but I

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,109
guess they're maybe it's not just a

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:27,170
gentle push for you folks but in the

00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:27,170
room we have some targeted

00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,699
[Music]

00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:28,799
that we layer on top of for all the

00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:32,029
secret sauce that Netflix has in our

00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:34,829
development environment is we connect to

00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:37,799
our station environment from our local

00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:41,339
machines and only abroad the specific

00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:43,470
services that we actually actually

00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:45,059
future developers we're doing and then

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:49,440
all the rest of center here is running

00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:51,440
out of the cloud one of the things that

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,089
we're interested in exploring is

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,140
dabbling with basically a spending or

00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:59,819
operator that would have a router

00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,789
running inside that kubernetes cluster

00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:06,779
of spinnaker that would then be able to

00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:09,059
do you connect to that router and it

00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:10,980
would be responsible for routing the

00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:12,420
traffic either to your local machine or

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:20,489
to one of those services that's right

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:22,170
now in the cloud sees that every if

00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:27,599
you're interested in contributing to

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:29,609
that kind of thing or have I would

00:37:27,599 --> 00:38:08,400
certainly love

00:37:29,609 --> 00:38:15,890
I think you know if you want to go to

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,890
the if you have issues

00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:23,760
[Applause]
