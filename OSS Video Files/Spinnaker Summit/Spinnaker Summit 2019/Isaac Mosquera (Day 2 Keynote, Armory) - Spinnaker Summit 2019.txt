[Laughter]

00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:14,880
welcome to the last day of the spinnaker

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,449
summit thank you for being here this

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,689
morning I really appreciate it

00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:25,560
about three months ago I was speaking to

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,320
an executive at JPMorgan Chase and in

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,650
this room it's myself and three other

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,870
executives from armory and we are

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,590
selling spinnaker we're going through

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,700
the features tell her about green Canary

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,550
and rollbacks

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,860
all the things that you would expect

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:46,649
when you talk about spinnaker and I was

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,239
I'm going through that she interrupts me

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,160
and she says something to me that I just

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,690
didn't really expect for her to say

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,090
which she said while it's vinegar a

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,640
great piece of technology the reason we

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,079
are standardizing on spinnaker and we

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,449
are supporting spinnaker is because of

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,119
the people at the community and I

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,490
absolutely love that response and what

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,290
it means is really that she is choosing

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,770
spinnaker because of all the people in

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,720
this room not just the contributors

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,759
people who recommended also the users

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,610
the evangelists that people who make

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,490
occupation Pete who helped put this

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,380
whole summit together and everybody who

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,930
supports spinnaker in their own way and

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,250
I just thought that was absolutely

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,200
fantastic

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,329
and that is why brought here today

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,030
really if you think about this vinegar

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,299
summit it is a celebration of the

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,670
community it is a celebration of every

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:43,070
that we've done this year and it's also

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,170
an opportunity for us to align together

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:50,090
about what we're going to do next year

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,310
so here are some of the contributors

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,060
some of the world's largest cloud

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,590
providers contributing codes spinner so

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,259
who knows superintended better than

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,319
Google who knows lamda ECS better than

00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:05,750
Amazon nobody knows this is what sets us

00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:08,509
apart we have the world's best cloud

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,970
engineers who think it's better but we

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,849
also have some of the world's best users

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,170
most progressive users using spinnaker

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:21,170
but they are dealing with challenges at

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:24,260
massive scale and while those challenges

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,209
are complex and important what I really

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,400
love about our users and our community

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,410
is actually the compassion that you guys

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,140
share from each other every single day

00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,599
in slot and I see it none of you have to

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,120
help each other but you do help each

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,040
other through those problems that you've

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,110
experienced before because there's no

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,389
way the core set of just contributors

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,000
and support the Masters have users that

00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:48,530
are using spenders and I love that you

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,500
also show up with signe teams to get

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,780
feedback initially a lot of other ports

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,900
which is great so we can fix them the

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,780
issue new heartsease new ideas to help

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:04,880
us understand what it is do you mean in

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:08,060
order to be successful with spender so

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,579
this is a quote by a famous management

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,010
consultant named Peter Drucker because

00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:15,889
many books out I'm sure some of you have

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,209
probably read some of his books and what

00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,980
he's saying here is culture eats

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,970
strategy for breakfast and what that

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,849
means to me

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,370
really is that anybody can copy our

00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,989
features and they're open source you

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,209
don't

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,519
cause me and base our features would put

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,739
them somewhere else anybody even copy

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,629
our road map our road map is publicly

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,519
available for you to see exactly what

00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,980
we're gonna build the best but when you

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,290
can't copy and you can't take from us is

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,260
our culture it's our community the

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,480
things that we stand for our values that

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:50,590
is what is unique to us and you can't

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,439
take that from us so what is our culture

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,139
and before we talk about our culture

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,540
let's talk about culture in general so

00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:01,000
what is culture culture is something

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,540
that you can't really touch but you can

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,400
feel it so let me ask you guys has

00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,569
anybody been part of the toxic culture

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,000
just raise your hand right now

00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:14,290
the thing about that most of you raise

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,940
your hand if you didn't raise your hand

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:21,009
that's good the thing about that is that

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,889
nobody intends to build a toxic culture

00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:27,130
it's actually the lack of attention that

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:29,530
results in a toxic culture and so we as

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,470
a community we want to be intentional

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,690
about the community and the cultural

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,729
values that we're building and what

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,070
closer means to us is how we work

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,699
together how we make decisions but

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,680
difficult the challenging problems arise

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:48,370
it's also how we come together and how

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,340
we show up for each other all right

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,850
thanks

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,970
so a while back when we first started

00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,220
our me asked Andy why he chose to open

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,220
source vinegar at Netflix and one of the

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,920
things he said to me was that Netflix

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,810
had actually went faster and bringing

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,660
the learnings from the community than

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,300
doing it on their own but he valued the

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,710
the openness that was out there he said

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,630
we could do this better together

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,530
and that was pretty great because he had

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,570
to actually open source some proprietary

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,190
technology to Netflix that competitors

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,130
were eventually going to get ahold of oh

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,770
really what this meant when this pirate

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:33,720
acts for us is learning in that and that

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:37,660
we're better together than we are apart

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,190
we also believe in learning moments so

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,000
of the division and the title of this

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:45,550
slide filler is okay but I realized that

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,350
failure is actually only a failure if

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,560
you don't take the opportunity to learn

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,640
and so I changes to learning moments and

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,410
I think that's really what we're about

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:59,680
right we're about minimizing the impact

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,470
of access and learning from them so that

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,050
we can iterate and quickly move right

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,970
reducing kind of started catastrophic

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,150
failures and moving into things like

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:16,780
fender-benders so we can not be stopped

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:18,910
by crazy errors in production so we also

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,030
need a lot of things that we aren't the

00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:24,700
things that we don't value culture also

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,710
encompasses that and it reminded me of

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,750
the stoplight the stoplight also have

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,740
really good intention but ask some

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,430
serious flaws

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,120
for example 15% of all fatalities on the

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:39,050
road happen

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,570
with soft light it also has a hard

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:46,790
dependency able to see when look just

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,020
ease out it no longer works it also has

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,720
to have perfect timing

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:55,639
if the timing is off by just a little

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,740
bit serious problems could arise and

00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,870
worse yet it actually incentivizes us to

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,540
do the wrong thing who's actually setup

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:08,300
by the yellow light if you didn't really

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:10,729
interact and even the slightest

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,330
distraction to cause catastrophic

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:16,130
results and the making of attractive

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,289
lies that you cannot be trusted

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,240
that's somebody else he makes miss

00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:23,030
decisions for you based on static

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,760
context and we believe that there's a

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,380
better way a better analogy for who we

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,400
are which is around the lab around about

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,740
actually puts the emphasis and the

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,639
responsibility of the drivers to merge

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,560
in and out

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,050
there's no dependency of electricity

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,430
it's just a circle the timing there's no

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,710
centralized timing is all decentralized

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,560
to the drivers the drivers making

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:51,470
assists the decision in real-time based

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,940
on the conditions on the road so it's

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,410
based on some loose rules we empower the

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,130
people on the road to make those

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:03,289
decisions it accounts for any road

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,349
conditions pedestrians anything that's

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:10,130
out there people riding bikes again when

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,630
you empower the driver right you have to

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,719
even let go of all these other things

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,379
like well it's just

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:18,149
in sexualized I'm actually a rising you

00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,080
to do the right thing when you enter a

00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,999
rapper balance

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,549
you don't speed up like you do it a lot

00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:26,999
you enter with seeking and intense

00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:32,310
they're aware and the basic assumption

00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:33,569
here is that you are to be trust this is

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,750
something that Amy's talk a lot about

00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:39,449
which is context over control and we

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,699
want to empower these developers with

00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:44,099
information you wanna power drivers and

00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:45,839
information to let them make the right

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,740
decision we don't want to take those

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,639
rights away from them we also believe in

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,180
safety

00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:58,410
so in 1930 we introduced seatbelts and

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,850
in 1985 we also made the mandatory and

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,000
in both of those times

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,529
accidents actually went up not down and

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,910
it was really interesting you need to

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,189
figure out what was happening in his

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,100
time and what was happening was that

00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:12,149
while accidental accidents went up there

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,430
were minor actions

00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:17,449
they were fender benders for when but

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:21,329
went down were catastrophic events

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:23,059
failures dollars so we we ain't

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:26,250
injecting and what ended up happening

00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:28,680
was we got psychological safety we have

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,230
physical safety and we ended up driving

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,300
faster we got from point A to point B

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,250
faster and that's all stuff they won't

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,559
you want and absolutely we're going to

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,750
get instant access but that's ok as long

00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:43,470
as they're minor accidents and fender

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:47,100
benders so one of the things that we

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,750
firmly believe in is that safety enables

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,800
velocity and that we're not choosing

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,480
between the two this is another thing

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,360
that you'll hear Andy say a lot bar

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,209
brands over gates and the reason this is

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,620
important is the guardrails kind of tell

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,860
us the

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,890
path to date right but we don't want to

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,100
enforce the fact that we know best we

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,160
know that as our contacts our situations

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,740
change as we learn we're going to want

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,390
to change this but how can we learn we

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,570
learned by experimenting and we learned

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,240
by moving off the the best practice path

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:27,410
we try these things and as we are

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,300
enforcing what we know then we don't

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,610
never try these days and this is really

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,840
important for us to have as a value and

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,940
all of these values are actually

00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:41,300
embodied in sticker and you'll see them

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,370
throughout the product we give you

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,160
context so you have information about

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,840
what's running in production with what

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,170
variations are there or container

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,620
version is their load balancer services

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,540
journey member gain will tell you how

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,580
that got there in the first place who

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,620
deployed it blend it with the play what

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:05,240
the play what triggered it what system

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:07,160
scented it he passes air we also have

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,170
the barbarians which I need to clean up

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,100
like this and it didn't stop you seem to

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,350
play into production

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,780
it'll inform you that this is probably

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,810
not the best time to deploy five night

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:21,350
at 6 p.m. but if you need to in case of

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,240
emergency you will we also have these

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,460
happy little accidents and production

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,310
that we can call canary right try these

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:31,990
things out in production is over pay as

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:35,180
long as they're not catastrophic events

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,220
we also integrate with chaos monkey we

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,570
have a resiliency is something that we

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,339
have

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,600
we care about and in that roundabout

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:45,610
example really it's a resilient system

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,389
regardless of the conditions the drivers

00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,130
adapt to the situation so what if you

00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:53,110
believe we believe in empowering

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,690
developers and you trust your developers

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,389
to make the right decision that we are

00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:03,100
not choosing between safety and velocity

00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:04,149
we safety enables velocity context over

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,850
control that we will give you

00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:09,279
information for you the driver to make

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,259
the right decision copper rails over

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,230
gates as we want to empower people to

00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:16,360
innovate and try new things we want a

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,740
minute minimize catastrophic events but

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,089
we don't want to avoid them altogether

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,850
we want to make sure that they're

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,889
drinking safely and we want to focus on

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,630
things like resiliency wants to iterate

00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:29,740
and learn and eject errors to see how we

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:32,410
react to them so this creates a pliable

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,839
is that and this waterwheel the fact

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,089
that we have in our community is

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,329
embodied in our opinionated Bloxom that

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:42,069
we call spinnaker that is consumed by

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,139
improvising with some businesses that

00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:46,000
also help them go through this

00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,470
transformation and change that our

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,130
entire industry is going through right

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,350
now as they learn and as they ain't

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,720
values from spinnaker and they see their

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,360
company has changed they'll join our

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,569
community too and we'll grow and we're

00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,240
full scale and that will have a par

00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:06,100
value in the community adapt and around

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,589
and around we go let's think about a

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,360
flywheel in that you can actually invest

00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,000
in an area any area of the flywheel in

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,759
your life

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,040
laughter and once a flywheel has

00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,740
momentum is really really hard to stop

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,569
and now that what we're building and

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,629
I've seen this for the last three years

00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:26,329
in this summer as we continue to grow

00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:28,550
our values continue the evening we

00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:32,420
continue to learn faster than anybody

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,009
else I also wanted to give thanks to the

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,810
technical Oversight Committee

00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:38,649
so if you're one of these five people

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,649
did you stand up

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,210
the ones that have to take all of the

00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,610
values that we want to have them

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,250
community and actually put it into the

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,230
practice and believe it or not it's

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,970
actually hard to get Google Netflix

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,070
Amazon and Amrit to all do the same

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,600
thing and go to the same direction and

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,910
it's not easy and so I'm very

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,760
appreciative of these people who are

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,470
doing work every single day to make sure

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,580
that we are all working well together

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:20,520
and we all embodied these values so I'll

00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,850
end on this so this is moment this

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:28,050
really beautiful moment that happens in

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:30,950
humanity its you're on the road in the

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:33,420
car and you hear the siren is coming

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,970
it's going you look in your rear-view

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,640
mirror and cars start the part of the

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:43,260
way and then of course you part ways you

00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,780
go to disorder and in that moment when

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,540
that ambulance is speeding by what we've

00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:51,450
done is that we've put the needs of

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,480
somebody else above our we've

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:57,960
collectively created this tap for this

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,810
ambulance that going by and this I

00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,450
believe is what we need a more of in our

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,820
community we need to elevate our

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:08,190
community above the needs of our home

00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,350
and then when we do that the stronger

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,470
our community will be because ultimately

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,870
what sets spinnaker and our community

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,630
departments of anybody else is us and

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:24,960
the stronger that we are and the better

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:33,580
that we are the better so thank you

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:33,580
[Applause]

00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,890
[Laughter]
