[Laughter]

00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:18,650
so we have a lot of these cases that we

00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:22,490
happen in really I mean the disability

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:25,730
also corporate rifle default method etc

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,730
right they all have one thing in common

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,230
and that's obviously how to keep in and

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,210
they're up and running with a

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:37,430
high-society you can think about right

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:39,530
so owner John directly on before you

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,199
actually think about the reduction you

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,930
have to secure the system right and what

00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:48,619
the most important things are you trying

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:51,409
to introduce in a movie once I found a

00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:53,510
solution so first of all we need to have

00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,159
a precision a notification and a

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,710
compositional thinking I was just

00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,449
listening people say well you know if

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,769
you jump in interest in a credit can

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:02,180
actually mess of the other or the

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,640
previous application an accident

00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,350
obviously we need control that we need

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,909
to forced yet and we work in a doctors

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,039
need to keep track of all the operation

00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,600
changes we need to know exactly to make

00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,000
the change we're going to grab that

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,650
operation support we don't want to go on

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,560
John people disease

00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,250
another actor at the Royal Hotel thanks

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,570
who wanna make it be that all

00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,880
communication between micro-services

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,710
this one where you have apartments to go

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,760
to pollution we have happened here

00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:37,700
listening obviously we have two end

00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,000
points the UI the API state media listed

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,490
as well so this is practically very

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,380
first thing that you do but is important

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:50,290
to actually kind of a decision we can

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,120
triple the data in the rest within each

00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:59,750
customer's information enough about my

00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:02,660
back we still need additional secrets

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,780
right politics and on the never be the

00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,730
part but yes don't keep asserted that so

00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,710
we need to play man chicken crime also

00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:15,740
what every other assistant image mega

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,810
require why certain abilities so I had a

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,380
lot of people here dragons connector

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,860
already introduction I have news for you

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:27,530
so I was tense that reported six percent

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,860
of critical vulnerabilities 35 percent

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,750
on spirit and representative so this is

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,570
particular start with all these

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,790
vulnerabilities we did this test without

00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,110
preparation

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,340
in 1/16 I need to double-check but

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:46,810
there's still so many will ever play

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,730
Disko we need to get a lower and finally

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,340
everything that is introduced in history

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,140
sign and validate you right so we have

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,090
basic things were actually training

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,230
archetypes mystical they need to be

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,269
verified now what is it secure which

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,200
seems to be very simple right now we go

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:08,799
to the colliculus it's written that

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,659
depending on Joe's blanket but you need

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,220
to have identify man you need to have

00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:14,470
another camera performance this

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,090
environment should work right no one

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,680
knows about this to be different you

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,209
don't want to servicing a green board

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,670
and all the plumbing and that

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,099
configuration and then you have one of

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,319
the permit the news like an apple and

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,540
everyone degeneration you never do

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,000
things in assembly so you need to have a

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,970
way to go up immedately I never take

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,099
deployments and that's what speaker is

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,099
just watch micro-services the

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,780
they need a break the VCI TV as well so

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,959
why don't you have spinnaker respected

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,250
so you can actually use the building and

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,110
that's it it's something that we

00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,600
actually then I have got a beautiful

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:03,390
slightly simpler if you will end up

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,130
having more than one of Spencer's for

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,840
any reason so place the things that you

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,300
want to do and I want to serve a

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,040
vegetable states protein tendon and

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,560
that's worse looking so crazy and and

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,470
all this will have helped and apparently

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,750
she said you have a prediction having a

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,030
defining to wrestle a right we have all

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,220
these Mac services with a breakfast

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,040
that's called and what is that without

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,980
an average or this just as a Fonzie

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
petition or Lisa that o'clock so there's

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,880
a lot of things we need to do in this

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,710
field I mean it's great to be coming

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,660
together to community and he's obviously

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,520
on the art field or brain field

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,380
- we can - I mean this because this also

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,420
preparation planning is right compu

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,580
religion has a cold you don't wanna have

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,010
someone to mess over the spinning of

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,640
things right precisely LT on and you

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,230
need to keep track of all these changes

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,820
we need to play around groups play a

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,710
structurally guys ready when I've

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,100
accidentally wound up with roles and

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,600
effects sometimes it is a different

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,810
thing to actually do piecing together

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,340
development testing and as hurricanes so

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,440
they need to understand where the going

00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,900
so you need to break the space we are

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,970
playing the same thing all over the

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,360
place why not start sharing all those

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,520
things together as a community as a

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,510
chair reference architecture and the

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:34,800
others we're at so I think that one of

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:34,800
the people to the Nexus in economics so

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,690
we said shaft we have active met with

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,900
protein and

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:11,170
this is very important for us we can

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,680
work it out most another control bath

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:17,890
supporting your features without the

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,260
help of my friends in anything right so

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,090
we can be the leaders not just followers

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:26,500
need one to participate in future

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:30,270
development things for other people come

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,580
together ID representation insecurity

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,590
greatest and the siege began by Chaplin

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,180
which is the basic idea and we have to

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,820
the interaction participating in each

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,490
team at six

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,710
let me I will respect the committee

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,780
decisions we want to leave that we also

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:50,290
respect what's been that's why I'm here

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:57,180
so that's super important for us and all

00:06:50,290 --> 00:07:02,970
the ladies love and because I love us so

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,970
this is a contraction and you break

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,130
jumpers so

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,909
to actually create an operator swap see

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,180
this is that we are actually three

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:26,210
people two notches on these therefore we

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,090
actually who made spinnaker

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,389
super robust system image on forces so

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,629
this is this man was ready thanks so

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,779
much

00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,180
if you didn't attend a chat session

00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:40,219
decision was amazing in factually

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,879
lightening the mood in traditional

00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:46,189
spinnaker and actually 15 minutes and

00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,860
dipper Guardsman the solidified

00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:51,650
everything about deity machine making so

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,800
I will go to the jungle thank you so

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,800
much

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,540
