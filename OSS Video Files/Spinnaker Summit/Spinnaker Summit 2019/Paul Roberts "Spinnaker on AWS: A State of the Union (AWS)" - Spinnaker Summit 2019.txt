Description: 
	In 2018, AWS began contributing to Spinnaker through our contributions to both ECS and Lambda cloud drivers. This year, we have continued our development efforts while doubling down on helping customers leverage services such as EC2, EKS, ECS, and Lambda. In this session, please join us to hear customer use cases, learn about the code contributions we've been making, and how we are working with the community to increase Spinnaker adoption.
