	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:15,929
oh good morning pretty sizable job for

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,210
Sunday morning I'm pretty impressed I

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,060
think one thing that stands out for me

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,109
this morning is how similar these

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,000
journeys to Pinterest New Relic

00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:28,619
PlayStation all these other companies

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,510
we've all kind of been facing this same

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,390
infrastructure challenges and we've all

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,760
kind of been following summer cotton we

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,590
all end up converging on spinnaker which

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,160
I think speaks volumes about spinnaker

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:46,469
kind of as a CD platform so as mentioned

00:00:44,160 --> 00:01:00,260
before I'm originally from the city of

00:00:46,469 --> 00:01:02,879
Bruges and now I kind of knowledge is

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,750
Libertines on the represent area news

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,240
continues with agree and observing me

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,850
has been growing very rapidly over the

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,880
past decade some of you might be staying

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,860
at an Airbnb after visit the confidence

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,799
there are about 80 1,000 cities and I'm

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,280
in the 91 countries so it's really a

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,580
global enterprise and so with the rapid

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,340
growth

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,650
we've also started seeing some Craftsman

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,720
infrastructure some challenges

00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,210
so the first thing we did is we needed

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,850
to split up or monolith so similar to

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,400
Pinterest we had a mullet

00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,610
it's called monorail on some monolithic

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,590
Ruby on Rails application this is very

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,050
big just to put some things into

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,530
perspective it's about 30,000 database

00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:54,470
columns it's about 1,500 engineers to be

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,330
coves we tried to deploy to in the

00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:00,520
change today I'm didn't work out very

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:03,259
well so we move through this paradigm of

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,290
micro-services so we're now splitting

00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:09,320
monorail into to monitor equals or I

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,390
guess do or equal in this case - OOP in

00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,330
treehouse - OOP

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,610
the next evolution of montrÃ©al visual

00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,280
houses are running codes and then three

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,500
house which will house over Java

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,959
back-end services you might wonder why

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,150
treehouse I'm the most popular listing

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,970
that to me is a tree house it's on Yahoo

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,520
Java the memory core holds Java back-end

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:35,690
codes with every color equal treehouse

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,239
names always fun so this is the glorious

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,549
future we were all working towards will

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,560
have - of the treehouse no more no more

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,940
L we're looking forward to this day it's

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,570
a couple years off but this is a

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,090
beautiful picture

00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:52,280
this is also a beautiful picture their

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,670
rapid growth of our micro services in

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,920
SOA and so as you can see since 2017 is

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:02,510
kind of have this exponential growth of

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,190
micro services and challenges this is an

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,190
actual picture of we've got months ago

00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm trying to keep the lights on we saw

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,180
some the boiler challenges and a

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,040
service-oriented architecture so what

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,690
are some of the challenges for every V

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,450
I'm sure all the companies have faced

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,670
similar issues we do have a qualified

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,310
deploy process so whatever love

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,590
happening is nobody actually knows how

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,230
to deploy somewhere else the service

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,510
so what happening is people ride these

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,100
rentals so if I wanted a boy famous

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,140
servers I actually have to read this

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,970
brown book and hopefully I'm doing it

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,150
right hopefully about taking down

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,220
IBM Unicom and everything goes well but

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,890
worst case scenario it costs an incident

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,170
and a post-mortem so we have this

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,550
in-house tool deploy board it was pretty

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,010
good at the point there's more lending

00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:52,490
from the umbrella service it was not as

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,320
good at like doing multi stage releases

00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,040
it wasn't doing the boycott flying

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,320
straight across

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,060
I'm so actually was that doable for this

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,930
mess away architecture

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,990
I'm sorry I mean my own there some of

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,550
the reasons that any particular

00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:10,190
spinnaker one thing that stood out for

00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,960
us is it's been proven at scale so it's

00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,480
running at Netflix is running at Google

00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,670
and everything is a pretty large company

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,400
um so we were pretty confident that we

00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,570
were going to be able to scale inspected

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,520
or her needs

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,710
we're moving towards communities I'm

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,360
spinning their house in any support out

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,760
of the box so it was a natural fit

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,590
there's obviously inaccurate open source

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,720
communities of you guys at all

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,520
one of the reasons why we are topics

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,530
vinegar it's built and deployed

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,870
pipelines as the core concepts it's

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,330
easily extensible and we get canary

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,570
analysis for free so what's not to love

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,970
right we make some expansions to spend

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:51,950
over the past year one of the extensions

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:59,060
we build as an integration for our CI so

00:04:51,950 --> 00:05:02,060
I mean Jenkins or so it doesn't really

00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,710
have a UI so one thing that we really

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,740
miss from moving from the poi board

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,419
internal systems to spinnaker was that

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,760
we need to have a way to kind of

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,490
visualize the status of our pillows on

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:17,000
visualize what's going on in production

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,400
and kind of show all this natural city

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,070
in the boy so we did this we actually

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,070
pulled that lead up or back end and now

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,840
visualize that the spinnaker may be very

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,210
happy to open source that I'm kind of

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,060
making more generalized and 2020 to be

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,210
happy to have a conversation about that

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,330
so where every right now and so I think

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,970
the key part for our migration was that

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,700
we didn't want to force people to move

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,460
from the poi poi to spinnaker so we have

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,400
very careful and

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,470
approach I'm just going to so the first

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,020
thing we did in h1 2019 is most

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,830
basically we needed to prove SME it

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,840
actually works

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,520
this thing could actually plays well

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,000
with our infrastructure so what we did

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,069
is we basically comforted all the micro

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,199
services that make a spinnaker and

00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:08,080
basically deploy spinnaker with itself

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,660
so once we did that once think it was

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,199
running infrastructure we did a pilot

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,360
project with some internal services

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,060
non-critical services or throw things it

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,120
was okay so we basically on water based

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,330
and services so now we're in h2 now we

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,500
actually know that spinnaker is like

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,030
they can actually recommend on

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,680
infrastructure so what we did is we

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,470
basically looked at all of the incidents

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,900
in h1 we look at the services that cost

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,970
and most importantly the incidents we

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,440
stop those because we said like hey

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,599
here's pretty clear this tool will

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,520
actually make the deployment safer allow

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,440
us to kinda like wipe off on what you

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,569
want to spinnaker and we'll make sure

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,880
that you have less progressions so we've

00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,289
been doing that we've awarded all of our

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,090
payments factoring or whether someone

00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:56,139
were thrust some of our load balancers

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:58,120
and so we've actually seen a renewed

00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,949
reduction in number of incidents already

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,020
and this gives us the confidence the

00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,509
data to go up to executive levels is

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,070
like a spinnaker cook tool we should

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,680
drive adoption what we're actually

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,810
seeing is contingent vane interaction

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,940
now becoming spinnaker influencers and

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,280
so now they're driving adoption kind of

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,080
organically for us so that's been it

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,730
that's been great so I'm planning

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,130
well GXP

00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,380
all services that they can be and I'm

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,210
beyond 2020 will kind of I've been

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,330
everyone else over and remove the toy

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,990
board to reduce it take that so how's it

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:35,050
going so far we have about 40 monthly

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:38,140
active services we've already called 30

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,220
protection incidents in q4 so if we

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,250
didn't have spinnaker that would have

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,950
been 230 post warnings and 90% of our

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:48,090
changes the pointless vinegar go through

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:51,240
some hormone automated canary analysis

00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,240
thank you

00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,860
