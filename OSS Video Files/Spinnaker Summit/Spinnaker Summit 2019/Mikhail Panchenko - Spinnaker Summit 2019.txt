[Laughter]

00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:17,720
good morning yes so I said genome

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:23,340
percent engineering that you read and

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,619
all that so it's just just the technical

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,150
strategy in architectural direction for

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,939
our internal platforms

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,859
you probably as many of you know is an

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,750
observer ability for a platform I'm

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,350
going you know don't know what that

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,300
means is that we are a task that absorbs

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,670
the elements of observable systems so

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,370
metrics traces wallet units you name it

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,950
I may allow you to do things with it

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,210
alerting comforting doing more and more

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,699
AI functionality and just help me make

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,550
sense of all the data for use by your

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,550
systems and currently we're ingesting

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,850
1.3 billion

00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:04,120
a minute which is quite a lot and is at

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,970
22 million per second so we managed

00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,880
quite a lot of data structure and rather

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,230
than giving you more boring biographical

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,240
information about myself I think it's

00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:17,760
more interesting to look at I wear my

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:21,310
CSV journey began and see how that's

00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,110
like how things have evolved but also

00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,140
the themes of a consistent over the

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,960
years where the themes that I said dr.

00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,280
Martinez in his stuff so when we go in

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
with screenshots with a flickr deploy

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,810
system I was actually give me excited to

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,729
see them being taught that that Flickr

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,740
Engineers gave literally 10 years ago

00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:42,910
about giving 10 plus the cores per day

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,590
of are at the time PHP monolith that doc

00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,060
is still up on SlideShare the URL is

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,899
really long ago much easier to find it

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,850
by googling

00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:51,270
and so if you wanna go check that out

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,530
and you just do a walk down memory lane

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,759
so even that wasn't my things we play

00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,399
this this is how we deploy tomorrow

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:05,100
Flickr by the way was only ever about 12

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,810
to 15 engineers during this era and so

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,289
grown and pretty simple but it got the

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,610
job done

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:14,319
I mean look at what the top is something

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,120
moving around into the law what's been

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,819
deployed and when but also there is a

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,860
checkbox and you might see why we need

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,110
to chat in your deployed log and even if

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,480
need be chatty or the for log so that

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,180
you can tell people not to deploy and

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
system work is things went from we call

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,200
the trunk at the time just staging

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,690
automatically and then you went looked

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,760
inside think it was broken on stage and

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,560
if it was you went and said well nobody

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,209
quickly is because if someone before

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,599
those problems we copy Canadian

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,980
production and I just easily interesting

00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,040
to watch the progression of these

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,230
arrival time so that's for ten years I'm

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,360
in relic now and we're still deploying

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:58,010
all the things but all the things look

00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,680
very different new relic is just over

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,480
five hundred engineers and until very

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,099
recently human we have more services

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,110
than have in James right so micro

00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,450
service architecture is introduced a lot

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,900
of a lot of amenities models a lot of

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:15,440
complexity computer cooling and so we

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,400
gave our engineers a lot freedom to do

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,810
what they need to do to solve their

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,610
problems there's not a lot of

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,650
destruction going on and you know what

00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,180
language of platform you use it's not a

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,120
global free-for-all you know you have to

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,650
kind of make a case for it but in the

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,870
end we ended up with it pretty you know

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,239
it's not a beefy monolith it's five

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,609
hundred services and you know as many as

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,639
eight different platforms fortunately in

00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:39,380
common containers which makes life a

00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,690
little bit easier in terms of operating

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,750
this system and removal people for it

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,340
but they're still like the tools really

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,600
have to nail it right because otherwise

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,250
it's just impossible to end all that

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,019
complexity so in 2016 we rolled out a

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,880
maze of marathon based platform to

00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,630
support our application and service

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,330
developers

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,210
most of the services that are stateless

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,430
that are either HTTP for network

00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,380
services or their cue consumers so to

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,110
serve that I introduced me this marathon

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:15,760
and it worked really well

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:18,400
honestly it's still up it's still most

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,780
most of our most of those services sold

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,620
on that platform and everyone is going

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:28,120
doctor that's been super happy however

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:31,650
as we you know would like the

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,630
application is a homegrown multi tier

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,780
distributed database right which is what

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,240
powers the core of the earliest

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,169
analytics feature size called NR DB if

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,010
that's the case you know deploying

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,540
traditional deploy strategies just

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,430
aren't sufficient right it's just too

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,800
complex rich cream inning too much state

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,930
right you have the manage storage if

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,400
you're trying to grow the cluster you

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,930
can move data if your time to do

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,310
maintenance you have to make sure that

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,750
that data can be certain somewhere else

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,110
and you just cannot name electrolux a

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:07,450
using things those without yeah without

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:09,550
there's too much too much fertility in

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,500
the means I just served the customers

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,060
that we need in this platform we deduced

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,100
an attractive man called Frank central

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,380
in Grand Central

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,330
the main feature of it is that it allows

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,190
the service order to declare whether

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,560
service is and what it's supposed to do

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,360
and how it means to be deployed

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,600
declaratively and it's attached to their

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,700
duties all right

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,750
birth control and so you can register

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,490
your repo the tool means your

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,080
description so there's certain ones like

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,490
this don't try to meet it it's just

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,400
boring the animal like any other boring

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,570
animal but it does the system you know

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,480
what it needs to know about people in

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:47,180
your service when you see that we can

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,680
get back in this tree right which again

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,060
is all the same things on it but

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,560
obviously people have invested a lot

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,240
more effort into making it look nice and

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,920
then the screen that we worked on it

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,750
clear but it's not always same stuff you

00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,800
know who deployed what plan when the

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:03,530
boys failed and you know what changes

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,990
were deployed and but you know it's also

00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,030
a lot more complexity goes again this is

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,400
we're now looking at a deployed page for

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,660
one of the 500 services that we have

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,250
right so the tool handles all our

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,400
environments all our current services

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:19,310
it's a pretty advanced but it's you know

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,510
it's it was build with marathon in mind

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,130
so making time to serve the other 20

00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:29,120
plus teams that we slope is willing

00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,470
their software directly onto host right

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,660
and just interacting directly with those

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,420
whether it's through scripts or

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,330
something intangible we realized we had

00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,050
work to do and so that's what that's

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,330
what the young

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,340
20-plus internal platform comes in

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:47,009
actually it's already production but you

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,750
know we're still rolling out it's a

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,919
multi cluster kubernetes platform where

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,340
we're splitting things out both by

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,400
functionality and also by customer

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,680
forwards to give us more liability more

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,199
ability to experiment and just being

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,520
able to then the grantees bid is what

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,940
enables us to actually serve a more

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,190
complex use cases so instead of just

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,659
saying hey let's migrate all these happy

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,889
application and service developers off

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:13,139
of marathon if you burn any of these

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,430
seven tears they're already happy we

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,930
could literally make it so that the

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,520
people who deploy mundane would end up

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,080
in a different Orchestrator need not

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,630
care let's target the folks who are

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,610
currently not serving at all and so we

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,500
did that and we're possible to using

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,210
staple sites for our really complex use

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,789
cases like the aforementioned and our DB

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,500
which is you know kind of looks like to

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,190
do with using that far enough but is it

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,219
really

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:37,139
we're using seriesin and operators for

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,550
those early this is the first kubernetes

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,120
related event and you maybe don't know

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,590
what that is

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,210
let's see Arnie is a custom users

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,659
definition it's just a way to teach

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,520
coordinating about ending a new map

00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:49,530
they say Jeff it's actually incredibly

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,300
powerful what that allows you to do is

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,610
it allows you to write code that runs in

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,490
four days control plane that understands

00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:01,360
you know yeah you yellow bastard

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,340
arabela right so you can say oh well I'm

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,259
the center DD cluster ladies know what

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,280
that is and you can grow it for anything

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,800
eise knows what that means

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,990
that's really powerful but you need to

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,310
deploy all that right so the boys look

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,479
very different in this in this world

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,860
it's not just going to play the new

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,460
version and make sure it works correctly

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,319
it's potentially deployed you know new

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,750
version the part of this particular tier

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,360
of this complex system it's potentially

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,610
you know Iran needing data pretty low

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,650
afford this particular hose before we

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,599
won't machined on it right I'm sorry

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,800
before we deploy code on it so we have

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,390
to support all that we still want

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,520
visibility into what's happening there

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:41,289
we still want the same feature is like

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:44,470
five columns and and you know apples and

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,790
all that so spinnaker fortunately has

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,380
elements right so rather than try to

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,089
build all of that into our system you

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,620
said let's increase the community let's

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:51,910
build work the rest of the grenades

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,250
community communities already going

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:57,700
let's take advantage of that the - for

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,839
us is canary support for our club I

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,029
don't do all is the language that you

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,520
used to speak to underneath what we used

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,670
to a different side of it and you can

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,660
tell vinegars I'm very worried right you

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:12,700
didn't even ask SNR DB whatever you want

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,200
it's not just based on air raid or

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,529
anything specific

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,450
whatever the events are metrics your

00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:22,060
service reduces you can you can even

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,700
create those and unity has delivered

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,440
right you really

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,750
full request really quickly to adapt

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,290
into our environment the onboarding have

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,420
been great and now he doesn't even

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,460
boring I personally just another

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,250
spinnaker screen but hear me out right

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,830
here is about your production services

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,710
employee validities start using standard

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,300
kubernetes we still going to do we would

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,320
like to make spinner to understand what

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,060
charities they're doing a little bit

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,000
better and you saw a lot of new patterns

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,620
for new use cases right those employees

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
look very different you don't want every

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,590
single team on these table service

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,830
defining their own pipelines from

00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,100
scratch over and over and when they do

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,820
we want to give me guardrails right

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,680
we're still very early in this process

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,350
and we're still trying to figure out

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,170
exactly how to get users to be able to

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,210
do experimentation but you saw the

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,960
luminaries still do proper validation

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:19,600
etc I'm severely sickness topic

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,190
obviously like everybody else on the

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,590
planet we're hiring so please come talk

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:27,660
to me like here's my email address and

00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,660
when we did I thank you very much

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,200
[Applause]

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,160
