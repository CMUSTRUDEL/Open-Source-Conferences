[Laughter]

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:27,160
good afternoon three years ago we

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:31,750
started pops MX with the dream the dream

00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,610
is can be deliver or the dream is to

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,760
deliver software without any human

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,760
intervention

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,989
every dream needs friends and today I

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:47,860
want to thank all of you for being that

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:52,510
friend and for all that hard work you

00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:57,460
know you put to make spinnaker come this

00:00:52,510 --> 00:01:05,619
far and you know they say no friends no

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:11,140
dream three years later there's 60

00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:14,950
employees and we contribute a spinnaker

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,939
we made about 600 contributions we just

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:22,780
ramping up our contributions now 19

00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:27,010
contributors SIG's approvals etcetera we

00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:30,190
as a company believe in spinnaker we

00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:33,430
provide open source spinnaker support

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:36,490
and we have a layer that's pluggable on

00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:40,060
top and you can remove it - it's called

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,520
the Enterprise spiracle extensions we

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,590
also have a machine-learning layer one

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,710
of the pluggable extension is a

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:52,450
machine-learning layer called autopilot

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:59,320
our team is we have a few here from

00:01:52,450 --> 00:02:06,370
Netflix AWS Cisco Oracle etcetera today

00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:17,319
I want to ask the question how big can

00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:23,819
spinnaker be so the crystal ball it can

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,819
be 200 billion apps delivered in a year

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,390
now how did I sort of come up with that

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:42,790
spinnaker to me delivered software to

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:48,099
any device that's the full protection so

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:51,230
simply you have 15 billion IOT devices

00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:53,750
you know you upgrade them or change them

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,299
once once a one someone and you get a

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:59,930
200 billion you have you have five

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:03,500
billion mobile phones the question I

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:07,879
always ponder is where are we now

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:14,859
we probably my guesstimate is around 20

00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:14,859
to 40 million deliveries a year now

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:24,560
where where could we go again it's a

00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:31,159
guess it depends on how we as a

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:33,889
community make this happen we could in a

00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:38,750
couple of years we could probably be 500

00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:42,440
million 1 billion today we are 2,000 to

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:45,500
3,000 companies using spinnaker you know

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,730
I could see it happening 15,000 to

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,970
25,000 community today is about 3,000

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:57,430
contributors 8,000 slack members which

00:03:52,970 --> 00:04:02,989
is about roughly 10,000 Etro 25,000 I

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,639
think the question is what do we have to

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:11,150
do to get there because nothing is

00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:16,940
guaranteed in life and so I am looking

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,530
at a historical success we just called

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,269
the Internet the reason I picked it is

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,919
personally because I have a story in it

00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,520
and also because it's played out very

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,710
well so internet connects every device

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,180
that runs software just like spinnaker

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,430
can deploy it every rural device

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,229
internet connects every device that runs

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,720
software

00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:41,840
roughly this is the ubiquity curve for

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,889
internet 1993 when I first got on the

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,629
internet was a

00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:52,999
40 million 40 million users 1998 was

00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:56,090
about 400 million then 2008 was 4

00:04:52,999 --> 00:05:02,590
billion and now it's 19 15 billion

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:05,509
mainly the the adoption went stepwise

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,580
the the 4 billion and the 15 billion is

00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:10,789
because of mobile and IOT devices but

00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:15,740
let look let's look at the 1993 to 1998

00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:17,479
this is where large companies were

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,379
adopting internet it was fairly complex

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:25,219
because I was involved in it and there

00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:28,969
was always trying to scale so there were

00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:32,590
pioneers that sort of adopted it after

00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:34,279
it scaled then there was a larger

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,509
simplification that happened to the

00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:41,659
internet that led it to scale further

00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:45,349
and then we were working on making it

00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:49,310
reliable if I look back or if I look

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:52,550
forward towards spinnaker I think to

00:05:49,310 --> 00:06:01,399
make it ubiquitous it needs to be

00:05:52,550 --> 00:06:03,050
scalable simple simplify and save what

00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,300
do I mean by scalable

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:10,029
what I mean by scalable is very very

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:14,029
dimensions first you have to have

00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:16,219
performance number of namespaces number

00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,870
of pipeline's number of application

00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:22,300
delivered etcetera you have to have

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,300
integrations but more importantly

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:34,490
yeah follow this so more importantly we

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,050
need to scalability is all about the

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,930
number of applications that you can

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,440
deliver so it's today the types of

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,510
applications you can deliver you have

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,240
micro services you have to be able to

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,720
deploy monoliths you have to be able to

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,889
deploy a different infrastructure

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:58,360
kubernetes AWS etcetera bare-metal

00:06:53,889 --> 00:07:03,080
etcetera and you have to also be able to

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:07,070
operate in highly regulated curve with

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:13,010
compliance and with various policies in

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:19,160
there simple you know there comes a

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:21,919
stage where the complexity is great you

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,280
you actually the scaling is awesome but

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,340
then there's a certain set of adoption

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,550
curve that hits where in you need to

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,169
simplify both within large organizations

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,410
for example you need to be able to

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:40,600
simply self-service on board application

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:43,490
self-service on board etc and then you

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,700
need to make it safe because you know as

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,830
I say speed thrills but kills so you

00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:54,680
need to make it safe so let me talk

00:07:48,830 --> 00:08:00,050
about a little bit of ask the next the

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,450
scalability so when would one of the

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,340
scalable what I mean by scalable

00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,490
platform is to deliver micro services

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,830
and monoliths so this is you know today

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,250
Mike everybody is moving to micro

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,320
services but there is about 90% a lot of

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,139
companies have 90% of their applications

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,400
as monoliths those monoliths can be

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,470
loosely said okay these are loosely

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,020
coupled monoliths tightly coupled

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:31,880
monoliths and we work with large

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:34,849
companies where the 10% is easy there's

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:39,200
a there's a 25% where with best

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:40,610
practices etc we can get to it there's a

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,940
there's another 25

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:47,029
and we're reduce things like a terraform

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:50,269
the etc terraform stays that we built

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:53,329
etcetera to get to there and I think in

00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:57,709
order to get that adoption curve to to

00:08:53,329 --> 00:09:01,519
maximize it is it would be awesome to

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:04,430
have the the spinnaker community provide

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,510
more support it's there are always

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:11,930
limitations but the that's what would

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,630
increase adoption the second dimension

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,740
that I want to talk about is working

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,950
across compliance and security

00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,170
environments you know in life you have

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:27,190
to have compliance and there are a lot

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:31,700
of big large companies that that have to

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:36,320
work in regulated industries today

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,720
spinnaker provides compliance as policy

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,450
controls for accounts applications

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,730
etcetera I think the goal would be if

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,110
you can go to finer grain policy

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,760
controls an example would be a stage

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:53,000
care can you set a policy by stage and

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,640
also towards runtime execution which is

00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,519
can you do pipeline during compliance

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:07,070
checks during a pipeline execution now

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:10,339
what do I mean by simple what I what I

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:19,120
mean is simple to deploy and all and

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:24,769
configure then simple to onboard users

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:29,060
essentially can you have implicit

00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:32,350
pipelines implied so wherein you can set

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,610
up the policies without having to

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:39,160
essentially the self-service onboarding

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:42,050
of applications then to deliver and

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,490
simply can you deliver deliver it and

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,130
operate you know ultimately every as as

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,440
a continuous delivery platform grows

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,540
there will be lot of other simpler tools

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,160
sampler tools that work in a certain

00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:04,490
environment that if we don't simplify or

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:10,569
even and downscale it is it will impede

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:16,880
the ubiquity of a platform the third

00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:20,990
which is safe when you go fast when you

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:25,940
goes at scale safety is going to become

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:29,180
a critical aspect when it says the way I

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:33,860
think about safety is safety to deliver

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:36,589
and safety to operate I think if you

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:41,139
look at the SDLC there is pre-production

00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:43,940
production rollout and post production I

00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:47,360
think the safety and verification is not

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:53,120
just limited to production role or

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:55,610
verification it has to there is a post

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,860
production deployment automated

00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,410
verification and I don't think the

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:04,519
rollback should actually be linked with

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:09,380
that and there is also from

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:12,170
pre-production you can have you can

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,540
actually look at the data and to make it

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:20,829
safer to be able to learn from the data

00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:24,709
and to make the delivery safe so let me

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:31,339
just briefly touch upon what Ops MX is

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:33,680
doing in these various areas so optimal

00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:36,889
approach to scalability is that we have

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,810
very work with customers for example

00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,550
when somebody wants to have a stateful

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,380
application that's delivered like a

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,149
database we have a database stage which

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,579
we're going to open source now it it

00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,990
basically would be my sequel Postgres

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:52,519
sequel and in the future it will be

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:55,459
sequel server and Microsoft or Oracle we

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,769
also have a compliance fine-grained

00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,839
policy authorization compliance that I

00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,910
talked about bits and pieces of it and

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,610
we go to open source that we have

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,700
ordered trailing and for infrastructure

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,680
we open source the

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,790
framework we have a brave metal

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,480
framework we open source of the

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:17,500
terraform a stage our approach to

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:21,670
simplify is for deployment a lifecycle

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:24,279
management we have we open sourced an

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:28,480
operator kubernetes operator we also

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:30,360
have spinnaker running in ubi for some

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,400
rig for some of the regulated customers

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,310
we have Red Hat certified operator that

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,120
basically allows your lifecycle

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:43,720
management of spinnaker to be done

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,730
easily for onboarding app users my

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,420
belief is that that's where you need to

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,550
really really really simplify we have

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,400
Kitab staggered pipelines but we're also

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,630
going to invest in that area for

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,650
operations we have a continuous delivery

00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:06,279
dashboard optimized approach to safe

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:08,740
delivery is that we essentially have a

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,839
product called autopilot autopilot what

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,839
it would do is it basically essentially

00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,300
ingests all your logs matrix etcetera

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,970
and makes assessments of during the

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,250
delivery during staging during cannery

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,339
analysis stage it basically assesses

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:29,130
what the risk levels of of your releases

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:37,350
are and then post into production we

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:39,460
monitor and also use that to rollback so

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:43,770
you know I'm going to conclude my

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:46,780
presentation with the belief that I

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,390
believe that spinnaker can deliver

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,320
software to any device and I think it

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,850
can become mainstream

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,250
the keys is to be able to make it

00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,440
scalable scalable platform we as a

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,210
community should work on it and to make

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:09,980
it simple and to make it safe thank you

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:13,680
[Applause]

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,390
can you repeat so my question was you

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,050
discuss spinnaker being able to as a

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,670
vision to deploy to any device the

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,150
larger the company the more likely that

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:27,630
they have legacy or non-cloud yes so is

00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,430
that a effort of spinnaker to at the

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,860
open source level or at the vendor level

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,990
to kind of bridge that and allow better

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,620
deployments from Paramus like VMware and

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:41,190
others yes so so the the question is

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:47,670
yeah so the the answer is yes I think

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:50,040
that to be able to deploy to I don't

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:53,450
know if I would call VMware legacy but

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,640
yeah legacy infrastructure bare-metal

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:59,130
VMware I think we are committed to it

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,370
and and at the right time we would

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:06,150
definitely open source that as a vendor

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,490
but you know I think you know as a

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,140
vendor we driven by customer priorities

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,480
but definitely that's that's a vision

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,090
for sure and without that I don't think

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:20,430
I mean they will always be a limitation

00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:23,130
to ubiquity for example adoption of

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:26,900
spinnaker would would would be yes and

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,900
we get asked that all the time

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,269
