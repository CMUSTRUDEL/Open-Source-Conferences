[Laughter]

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,080
good morning everyone my name is Michael

00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:21,160
Benedict and I'm here to talk about CICU

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,820
at Pinterest something about me hiding

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,470
from the organization on Pinterest and

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,539
you know one thing our goal is to help

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:32,410
make their developers extremely active

00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:35,050
happy and reading about their job this

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:39,539
is my Pinterest board and I think before

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:42,370
I start who hasn't heard about Pinterest

00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,930
okay so that's really good

00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:47,340
I think I want to do a product which

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:50,079
over there for Pinterest anyway so

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,030
fitness assistant we train our mission

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,010
is one thing you want to bring everyone

00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,460
the inspiration to create a life scale

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,559
of and more specific we want to help

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,840
people to discover new things and they

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,300
pursue that outside the norms of your

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,650
screen or your application for example

00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,840
one wearing this amazing that piece

00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,670
today very much less making the cutters

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,730
over here have a fitness board

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,150
collection have multiple shoes which my

00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,400
wife is not gonna be very happy about

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,410
but then again just to give you context

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,630
and how large Pinterest reading is we

00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:27,049
serve more than 320 million years

00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:29,770
across across the globe and then just

00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:32,509
collectively holds over 200 million pins

00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,450
pins is basically a Nicorette adopts a

00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:38,960
tweet and twitter or post any other the

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,299
top social media the thing is the most

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,399
important aspect of fact is it's all

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:46,100
human curated that people have actually

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,619
taken the extra step in something it

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,209
could be an image a link a video and

00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,869
actually categorize her white

00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:56,149
annotations which collect these amazing

00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:59,929
visual graphs of what's also really

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,579
likable they get inspired with with that

00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:03,679
how does the our job is to provide

00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:06,170
amazing delightful experiences to our

00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:08,119
pinners and that means my team's job is

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,220
to make sure every engineering company

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,819
is again very and this is our

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,670
vision our job is to provide a fast safe

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,010
and a delightful path to take an idea to

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,230
production and keep things you know it

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,920
we're at this we don't want anyone to

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,840
worry about infrastructure with that let

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,430
me tell you a story about a continuous

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,829
delivery and how pictures to be moved

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,650
from what it used to do today previously

00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:36,799
in terms of deploying two machines one

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,299
by one - right now fully embracing that

00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:42,560
continuous integration into the green

00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:45,470
platform any team we are this was in the

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,160
process we basically made tracks as we

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,160
were moving fast

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,209
Kino right now but I think and we want

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,819
to give you the complexity how hard this

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,590
is and just between each rate this is

00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,150
meeting on a technical challenge and

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,790
that's what we have here to talk about

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,160
it's more of a process challenge so

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,900
they're bringing started this is kind of

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,540
the Pinterest is that side of the brain

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,030
right

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:13,500
bring the amount excited stack and the

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,840
serve excited staff and this the reason

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,030
I want to show this is it wasn't reading

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,069
anyone for us to first understand like

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,060
where the proper may be nice and then

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,590
focus on that but he would calm install

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,010
to give your footprint of how large an

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,390
infrastructure is it's freelance I won't

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,389
really go through the number instances

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,950
there but then come back to helping

00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:37,349
define the problem how's the

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,530
architecture play a role with I could

00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:45,299
fit how we decided to solve this it up

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:47,459
how did we design something so going

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,500
back to our next item we realized I

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:53,220
interest again runs one of the largest

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,260
modulus we have a growing pison so are

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,139
so nice fact is that the top right there

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,639
our API uh service in our web service

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:05,819
both of them are still on their

00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:07,109
monolithic I so this graph and post and

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,030
did you see your perspective on Kalamata

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:11,069
that is we actually have more than 200

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,799
plus engineers committee code to just

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,750
those two systems we see more than three

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,519
thousand five minutes of money and it

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,130
runs a little a classic servers and

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,900
screen art system and that may help us

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,419
focus we realize that if we click unlock

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,220
value for those any engineers were

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,710
shipping these amazing features of

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,810
interest dinners that we the biggest

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,150
buyer back to show the organization and

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,699
how we can bring it fast so we had

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,039
pointed to the a particular service bay

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,409
particular assistant and we do not have

00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,449
a large economy and we started doing

00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:43,710
deep down into trillion ascending

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,289
companies are happening for that

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,050
platform and yes it's a long list of

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:52,160
challenges I'm just

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,169
top ten there that make more than that

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,879
but true chemistry at a high level one

00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:00,360
of the key things which was trading us

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,460
in the past is the plunger 1889 we would

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,669
actually do the plummets twice a day

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,740
it's scheduled at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. and

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:09,840
rest assured now that was that schedule

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,729
met Terry we've never get it to play out

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,169
because there's so many that's going out

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,879
there so we use the straight push that

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,979
changes that it was extremely hard and

00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,590
just to get a sense of why that was the

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,180
case we did a full analysis and Finance

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,599
and the palm statement and this is what

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,400
we came up with with that wasn't

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:27,690
understood what the problem was the next

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,430
step is to define will achieve success

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,830
criteria I would actually convince

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,169
people that appears that the a problem

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,880
but how we measure success so that's the

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:38,220
next thing your child meet when we start

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,759
focusing on we circles with people

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,530
emitters so one is velocity we know we

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,940
trust our like understanding metrics and

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,370
how long does it take about the first

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,469
shift code from 90 of introduction the

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,870
second one is what quality how bleak it

00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:54,719
can be you know find out how it before

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,710
he gets deployed a question and finally

00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:58,050
reliability

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,659
how often was back hooked up get

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,240
deployed and has a significant impact on

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,919
our business metrics

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,120
obviously it's very hard all these

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,610
members together I didn't come up with

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,379
one

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,210
no metric but we were pretty close it

00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:13,689
out like because we came up with this

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,330
one release SLO but he may be turning

00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:20,530
which it takes from the minute plans to

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:22,960
deploy and this one gets speaking about

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,360
more about that later so the next step

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,919
between the experience now that we have

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,780
the common domain we have a success

00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,150
metric we have a sole figure out what is

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,219
the right number there let's understand

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,949
how you go about it money that number

00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,659
it's really it's from each areas this

00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:40,210
mellotts started this is the first

00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:44,080
variation of how we started doing CSEE

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,080
at Pinterest we said that they were to

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,030
start deployed 9:38 continue trying to

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,719
claim this manually itself like am i

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,509
pathetic

00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:54,699
and you can see me actually typing on

00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:57,009
the first amount and this is how it goes

00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,379
through them on a day-to-day basis and

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,979
the day they actually hour-by-hour basis

00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:04,659
I was living this every day let me meet

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:07,319
obviously there's a collection of Hong

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:09,639
Kong engineers and they came for this

00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,830
but this is what every day they were

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,930
doing to emulate or continues them that

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,960
we actually meetings and yes it's a very

00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,039
hard process and you can see there's my

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,169
technique actually post in the

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,599
innovative high status so we got from

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:25,589
you know one or two success from the

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,589
place to Porsche system the

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,010
another one again they're making some

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,250
progress but we started to my 18 years

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,110
and finally we were so happy when we

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,919
went to get like three to five to close

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:46,600
the day it is insane and you can see the

00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:49,630
number of clothes and yes it's it was so

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,340
much that he caught us understand what

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,870
we should idea what should be focused on

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,419
so overall again says across the

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,760
Louisville code test bill deployed the

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,440
degree and operations so we did didn't

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,080
money that there are key areas in each

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,300
of these specific hitters to automate

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,310
and focus on that's one pretty much

00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,770
highlighting over here it for example

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,660
it's a no-brainer that you have to do a

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,970
PR validation that we actually pushed

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,919
you master but yes and we actually have

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,229
to give back as to how often does it

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,410
breaks about we decided that we

00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:26,050
absolutely need an older test suite of

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,000
tests with pretty precise order so that

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,850
we can actually go ahead and block their

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,890
leases if something else include the

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,300
bringing something complex anyone

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,430
including kind of clean the boat first

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,550
go sea ice and there's a need for a

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,409
synchronous pipelines and

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,589
in any analysis to make sure that we can

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,300
monitor any allotments and finally you

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,519
want to fail fast and you want to make

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,019
sure that you can roll back or meet any

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,820
sort of reliability of shares production

00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,470
and yes obviously pipelines is a big

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,230
thing this is my first time spending

00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,959
right now frog legs but community this

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,870
enabled us to do most we start

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,110
orchestrating RCX you need process

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,550
interaction space and pipelines letting

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,500
some things it's on the top the global

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,940
continuous deployment pipeline is a very

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,640
specific one you can see at the bottom

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,640
but being provided our service immerse

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,560
the flexibility which is had seven

00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,149
stages and experiences it's part of the

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,860
role of process jr. we actually

00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:28,290
determine that world where we wouldn't

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,649
have to hundreds of become a genius and

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,060
a single deployed what's happening today

00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,550
95 continues deep interest is being

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,260
employed as you can see or that we

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,910
worked on that computer experience where

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,160
now we're shipping like three commits

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,320
for comments on every deploy and even if

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,540
there's a finger at the best we're going

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,820
back to my treatments which is insane

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,920
and finally measure I think this is the

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,690
best practice show like I always sure to

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,820
saw the customers under the executives

00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,730
at Pinterest and we see where the

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,010
inflection point is the blue baboon line

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,380
basically showing favor

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,940
station last of it and how address

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,830
introduced want a number of the plug is

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,300
increased and that's what we can you

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,300
spend here right like you can start

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,190
seeing the number of the close we go up

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,310
I think a new perspective we actually do

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,770
more than 25 to close a day continuously

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,600
from 95 and the p9u time of those

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,030
arguments are actually under four hours

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,890
their testimonials from users would say

00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,940
I see something and I forget about me

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,950
because I'm the only than a certain

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,810
amount of hours that's a question that's

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:34,670
initiative to our Peters so I would

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,320
oppose this poking out of it to more

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,420
slice and one thing is I just treated

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,740
this up recently the graph you see there

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,630
is fascinating and I'm so I just because

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,820
those are basically all the shops which

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:49,550
go up within a pair of day and that was

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,870
happening to fight so yeah I mean you

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,390
don't have to stop dip on this after

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,460
12:00 p.m. and yes historians whenever

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:59,570
possible it is but today this is how

00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:01,520
we're doing step interest and finding a

00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,380
little table to the top which is

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,860
happening today were 30 bikes totally

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,450
amazing engineers who are here somewhere

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,220
waiting and that's what are we talking

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,380
about how we production ice vinegar at

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,560
country's economy enable what we just

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:18,770
saw the amazing stats up over all the

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,730
climate or the papers tell me that but I

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,170
did see my evening for the time

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,490
this is an amazing community between

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,490
excited to be part of this

00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,710
