[Laughter]

00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:17,400
governance I'm Tom accountability and

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,960
I'll be the helper for this Bock I'll be

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,759
shuttling the microphone back and forth

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,829
trying to facilitate the question

00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:24,269
without further ado a minute you're gone

00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,480
each of the speakers introduce

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,480
themselves

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,380
I'm Greg bumpstop probably designer and

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:37,160
on spinnaker for about a year over at

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,710
Netflix I am part of the UI um sake

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,300
sometimes I drop into the hoods sake

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:47,660
didn't the spinnaker summit

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,660
I think sake is one more I'm Rob senior

00:00:48,649 --> 00:01:10,259
engineers I am Eric Spang I am a

00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:17,220
software engineer who little and like

00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:20,310
Ethan I coach Aaron and I magnetical

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,020
also am an engineer at Google and Koli

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,520
you guys attend also involved in the

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,530
Caribbean living in there and my name is

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,170
Angelo Burton I want delivery

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,860
engineering at Netflix and I'm going to

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:38,159
panel moderator and so I thought we'd

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,850
kick off the panel and start with how

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:49,380
can someone get involved with spinnaker

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:52,380
the project community so I think one

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,390
thing we want to highlight is that the

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,429
lowest barrier injury is not necessarily

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,110
being a contribution so there are other

00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,610
ways to kind of flooring box of you

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,740
involved in the community and would be

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,630
something as simple as your operator

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,190
excellence vinegar and your reading

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,259
documentation and there's a gap that you

00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,479
notice and you fill it any makeup sorry

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,330
it's our github repo that's a very local

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,310
contribution another thing you would do

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,110
is doing this Lac community there are a

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,970
lot of folks in there organist are the

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,440
core code contributors but who who are

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,300
you know helping other members of the

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,890
community with questions they've wanted

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,079
to a similar troubleshooting situation

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,829
they live in a bucket so this was to

00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:31,650
kind of easy ways to get involved and

00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:34,079
for those eva came to three of our top

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,220
on the kinetics provider yesterday one

00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:38,100
thing we have besides there that i'll

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,780
say in this audiences come to attend

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,519
estate meeting even if you don't have

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,989
any change you want to make or any

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,430
people contributions these things are

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,860
not just for people that are core

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,290
committers deserve for users operators

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,410
vinegar and we want to understand how do

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,329
you use vinegar where you see gaps where

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,950
you've run into strange issues that you

00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,569
might have warned around but you feel

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,459
like there's a probably

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:06,830
or that so please come to those think

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:10,069
that's great yeah and I think this kind

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:13,610
of like build on top of that a lot of

00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:15,260
big attendance is very operator today so

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,360
all the people who are responsible for

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,160
running it's been occurred within an

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,709
organization and so one of the things

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,989
that we wouldn't really love to have

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:25,640
start happening is the actual users

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,370
people who are if you're operating it's

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,319
been heard they're your customers

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,060
because we want to make spinnaker not

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,220
only easy for the operators but one man

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,680
can use before the end user as well

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,330
because that ultimately makes your job

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,700
easier

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:46,790
so yeah just everything that everything

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:50,120
that I said everything that they said is

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,750
totally legit but it's been very much

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,489
focused on like changes and problems and

00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,440
that kind of thing one thing that you

00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,769
really want to see as well as just hopes

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,769
of dreams you as an operator or as a as

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,660
a user spinnaker wouldn't be wearing

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,239
this today and almost people are coming

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,670
to the table with new ideas that can be

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,709
done just to improve our new features

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,680
that we hadn't really thought about so

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,570
if any and all ideas whether it's back

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,430
on things that are actually broken or

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,390
can work a little bit better or totally

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,740
new areas that span birthday and the

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:28,360
great events movie engine start

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,430
management be phenomenal

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,550
just want to add going to the state

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,890
meetings can be as simple as dropping in

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,560
staying on you don't even turn your

00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:43,220
camera on if you're just curious on a

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,560
particular topic you can just drop in

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,800
and listen in but if you want to

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,440
participate all all the relevant state

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,560
dogs are editable so you just have a

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,090
bullet point and put your name next to

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,540
it and we just kind of run through the

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:07,490
list every week so it can be as involved

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:10,010
or as little as you want it so I don't

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,860
have to have like that so let's say is a

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,720
special interest interest group there

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,050
are a number of states a you mentioned a

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,780
Cooper Denny sig there's a doc Sagan

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:24,470
there's a security singing in if you

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,210
wanna say pipelines is code spenders

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,310
code and I think there's even one kind

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:33,860
of inflate alright operation is safe

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,510
plug them so clearly minute security so

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,500
clearly there's at least a half dozen

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,360
SIG's and probably more than upcoming

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,940
there's probably hopefully some safe in

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,120
your mind and so my question - we'll

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:52,000
start with eat them how does one go

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,000
about suggesting city

00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:01,969
so I guess when it comes to saving

00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:04,009
formation it is I can do that when it

00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:05,929
comes to state formation it's like the

00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:09,709
first place you start is just an ideal

00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:11,139
right we've actually had a lot of ideas

00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:15,229
for different things

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:23,119
some of which have handouts on which my

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:24,619
cuttings are printer sticks and yeah we

00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:28,189
so we have a proposal template in the

00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:30,229
spinnaker slash community repo where you

00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:31,639
can propose a cig there's a number of

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,669
before advice there's actually an open

00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,949
one right now posing any operation stick

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:41,330
that's gonna be when my sales are

00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:43,069
totally but yeah and it's really what we

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,909
want to try to capture is just like a

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:49,399
group of people who have some type of

00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:51,979
interest in any area that's parent

00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,559
doesn't have to be you know one specific

00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:57,409
copywriter or one specific feature area

00:06:54,559 --> 00:07:01,219
and it can be a cross-cutting kind of

00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:03,889
thing but what we really want is people

00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:05,499
who care about a specific feature area

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:12,050
and really want to invest heavily in

00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:14,869
that area so you know project governance

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,089
is essentially a large term that

00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:20,360
essentially tries to capture kind of the

00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,819
the processes by which the community can

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,430
interact in some saving fashion it's not

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,870
like a

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,330
see his club where people make decisions

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,930
and sent to your point see the same

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,350
processes is documented and it's on get

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,860
up

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:37,590
so thank you what would see or you are

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,360
and then tell us about the

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:43,710
responsibilities in terms of what it

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,020
means to be honest a clean try so I

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,580
believe on the UI you in sync with the

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,290
Chris Nilan from Netflix and the

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,240
responsibilities include for small

00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,540
filling up there tumblin that's an

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,240
imagination is a music and secondarily

00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,650
we have charters I think they're called

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,690
that we publish with sort of the

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,210
objectives in the roadmap of each stage

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,420
you kind of need a plan for what you're

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,850
sick is meant to discuss and achieve

00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,950
thirdly maintaining the agenda and

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,440
setting the meeting time and making sure

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,330
that you know the Google hangout and the

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,610
agenda are publicly available 720

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,890
conjoined and knows when to join and

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,840
then fourthly kind of you know just

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,720
running a meeting itself making sure

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,250
what sources heard kind of leading the

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,780
open discussion that to take place at

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,340
the end of the meeting and an

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,990
out-of-band of the actual estate

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,850
meetings an additional responsibilities

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,730
of the six has been issued triage in

00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,770
that kind of domain area so if an issue

00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:43,710
comes in on the smoker github projects

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,180
it will be tagged with that cigs label

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,640
and the message is responsible for

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,620
managing some

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,300
when determining you know who will

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,769
address this issue should be addressed

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,600
this issue is this a beginner-friendly

00:08:51,769 --> 00:09:04,149
issue who can be ready to summon the

00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:09,320
community you brought up an interesting

00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:12,560
subject issue trio and the spinnaker

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,980
github organization has over a dozen

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,930
read those and those repos each have

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,920
issue tracking and then there and maybe

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,600
some people in the room are aware

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,450
there's a senator spinnaker repo where

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,370
there's also issues captured so to talk

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,990
through kind of the challenges with the

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,420
issue triage if i'm an end-user

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,100
I would love with spinnaker we're doing

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,240
where do I smile that bug

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,620
especially mine I didn't know that it's

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,570
let's take the cloud driver where do I

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,760
follow it and then how what is it the

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,350
process of triage and how could we do it

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,709
better I would like to take that

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,570

00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:46,220
observation have all of our issues

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,660
consolidated under the spinnaker

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,130
spinnaker read though occasionally is

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,130
we're kind of spinning up a new micro

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,290
serviceable for time period have had

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,959
issues file directly against that repo

00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,790
so the maybe replicate year or two would

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,490
go higher and had issues mystery though

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,709
at this point most issues are filed in

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,510
are spending or swagger so I have a

00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:08,000
little bit of life cycle is it an issue

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,529
when you file it and I guess maybe a

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,240
little want us to hear like what they

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,040
lifecycle kind of has been in the past

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,399
maybe what we're moving towards in this

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,160
is definitely a work in progress so I

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,110
think in the past of a lot of missions

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,000
under spinnaker spinnaker weren't super

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,760
probably review is sort of more of an ad

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,949
hoc process where if somebody who kind

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,899
of recognize something in the issue

00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:31,250
title or worked in that area saw it and

00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,899
we did out there and we kind of get some

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,100
attention and maybe fix it if not it

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,500
might kind of fall through the cracks

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,829
and I think a few of you may have

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,920
encountered spinnaker bots who looks at

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:44,420
every issue but waits 45 days tax issue

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,940
scale and then

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,649
or days that closes the issue I think

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,420
recently we kind of decided this is

00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,540
probably not a great experience for

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,089
people involved in the community because

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,980
as we talked about earlier get involved

00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,410
it's not just about doing PRS or self

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,209
making code changes up this is for many

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,010
people their first interaction with the

00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:06,829
spinnaker community obviously we really

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,589
wanted to try to prove that process so

00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:11,600
what we've done now and again full

00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:15,500
disclosure this is a work in progress or

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,980
not that is as issues come in we're

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,290
tagging those with the responsibles sake

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,850
and then that gets into the process that

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,589
might be described earlier work kind of

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,209
the sig leads of each state go through

00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,269
and use you assigned to their city and

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:31,430
then take some sort of ball of action

00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:33,529
but I think really our rule here is

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,240
there are some issues that we won't face

00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,430
that maybe the inside of scope or

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,930
spinnaker or maybe it's a reasonable

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,240
idea that there's no it'd be really nice

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,949
time to work on it now but we really

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,630
like that to be an actual discussion on

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:46,940
issue you know a comment saying hey this

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,440
is a great idea but we don't really have

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,750
anyone it's free to work on it right now

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,910
but if you'd like to let's talk about it

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,170
or maybe in some cases hey this is not

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,519
something we really think if it's a

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,610
Melissa vinegar but we'd love to

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,449
understand it use case better but really

00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,490
trying to actually have a real

00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:02,870
discussion between humans about the drug

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,680
than just kind of having things Auto

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,300
close and so there are still issues that

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,220
will fall between the cracks because we

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,720
don't have perfect sink covers and then

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,890
that's the part of it that's maybe the

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,920
most work in progress

00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:18,740
I think we recently just added a github

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,269
a whole city none which is to at least

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,620
give us a feasibility into the issues

00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,660
that are falling between the states I

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,930
think really use that to try to

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,930
understand where we can and then

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:32,620
hopefully at some point once we have

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,170
better state coverage in those signal

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,610
shoes are less numerous will maybe come

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,080
up with some process to kind of just be

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:44,770
a joke I think we're never going to get

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:46,090
a hundred percent coverage so we're

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,190
getting more than a few of questions

00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,790
just raise your hand and I will let me

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,320
that we want this to be interactive I

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,380
wanted to kind of pick on something from

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,910
the sense of we have States and we have

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,330
steering committee and we have a

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,630
technical oversight committee what's the

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:11,500
difference between them I would like to

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:16,300
take I'll start from I'll start from the

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,370
bottom up so as as normal people in the

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,290
community the first point of contact is

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,480
typically going to be as safe and they

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,820
are responsible for a certain domain in

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,940
silence Spinnaker's develop for example

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,850
the AWS say they're responsible for the

00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,130
ec2 cloud provider East guess Lander

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,440
than that sort of thing so any issues or

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,750
requests feature requests they are the

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,020
people that facilitate the workflow

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:44,260
around that and anyone's able to join

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,660
these things and then there's a handful

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,820
of people that need it just kind of in

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:53,500
terms of making sure that ACOG keeps

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,410
living and then the layer above that is

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,770
the technical oversight committee and

00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:02,110
our main Charter is to drive consensus

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,120
across all the states and all the

00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,030
companies that are involved heavily at

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,750
the cypress vinegar to move in a single

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:13,750
direction it's totally reasonable that

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,270
let's say Netflix one wanted to one

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,400
particular thing

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,020
totally matched with another company and

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,220
that's fine that's the way that source

00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,770
does what we want to make sure that

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,660
there's a unified vision that everyone

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,700
is generally going towards about stuff

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,230
that's the main charter before of the

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,550
technical Oversight Committee and also

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,770
to act as kind of a tiebreaker

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,900
if there's a conflict for a particular

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,910
state they don't know how to resolve a

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:45,460
particular issue in the escalated up to

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:47,140
us to advise or potentially recommend a

00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,860
particular solution one way or another

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,160
and then the level above that is the

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,580
steering the steering committee is

00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,460
similarly chartered with direction but

00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,810
it's more than a problem and deciding

00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:09,010
what are the stakes that should exist

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:10,950
and like where is the throg itself going

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,320
rather than the technical implementation

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:18,460
they're defining well spinnaker should

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,350
be excellent at delivering safe and

00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:24,820
continuous software delivery but maybe

00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:28,090
also for data or whatever so that's

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:31,920
that's the general hierarchy that the

00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,920
governance group

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:41,630
forgive me quite straight so I'm a

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,640
community member and I understand how to

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,709
create a say wow

00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,690
but in this case I just have like a

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:51,740
great idea or whatever I want to add

00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,399
this new cloud provider for like we

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,490
already have

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,839
Sally baba think is in flight Tencent is

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:01,519
it baby let's imagine there's new club

00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:07,220
divider and O's and no man I want to add

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:09,589
no med support to spinnaker or I want to

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,510
change the UI to be you know let's say

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:14,329
handle a different type of like

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:17,149
organizational structure how where do I

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,300
start would like it me who wants to take

00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,300
this

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:29,810
so I'll half answer this if you need UI

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,649
recommendations UI young sig is the

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,010
place for you

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,690
we don't only talk about the existing UI

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,180
we talk very forward-thinking

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,890
all the design lofts for new features

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,279
are shared in that state and tossed

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:45,380
around and so if you have even if you

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,970
just have an anecdote like this part of

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,990
the u.s. really frustrating for me or

00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,130
people have my company and really

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:54,199
stumbled with this just dropping any

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,120
little bit of feedback is is welcomed

00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:59,089
and the more that I hear the same story

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:05,540
the higher in the priority fixing that

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:08,689
becomes and so at a higher level if you

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,579
have a feature or something they would

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,800
really like to see happen or something

00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,260
that you might be interested

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,420
one of the things that we've had a lot

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,339
of success around is the concept of our

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,040
FCC proposals

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:24,400
I myself have done quite a few Robin and

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,410
you've done a lot but really that's it

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,600
that's kind of a great place to one

00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,580
share the technical design like kind of

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,530
what you want to do it's also a really

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,090
good place to share what is the what is

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,650
the user story what is the actual

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,360
problem that this thing is trying to

00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:43,210
solve and with that it gets us all kind

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,630
of a chance to share anecdotes about

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:49,000
things that might relate it in my help

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:52,330
us all haven't come to a consensus on

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,120
what a particular feature or change will

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,770
either give us or take away what are the

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,880
trade-offs and that's to kind of like

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,270
reference Isaac's talk earlier this

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,250
morning we as a community are kind of

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,460
responsible for driving this forward

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:16,810
it's not just Google or Netflix or

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:18,580
Armour but it's it's all of our and the

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,020
more people the more brains that we have

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,190
on a problem the better it's going to be

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:26,230
for everybody and when it comes to the

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,810
RFC's we're not looking at necessarily

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,730
for the most in-depth like 30 page

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,320
document of how everything is going to

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,750
be specifically complemented it can

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,030
start as just an idea like I have an

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:43,360
idea I want to create a cloud provider

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:46,390
and for XYZ reason and it can just be a

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,130
jump start into a conversation of ok you

00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,990
want to do this major feature it's a

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,420
spinnaker here are the things that

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,490
people have generally in the past had to

00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,590
reason about before actually doing a

00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:02,370
technical implementation so it's really

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:02,370
front loading a certain degree of

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,380
problem solving before actually having

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,200
to invest in doing a bunch of

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,730
getting feedback at coding time and ory

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,010
west side where there's not a lot of

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:17,419
effort already put in and potentially

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,980
questions escalate well why didn't I get

00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:21,010
feedback on this earlier

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,330
well the Barbossa process is there that

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,330
help people be as efficient as possible

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:43,390
where would someone submit the gnomon

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:45,760
and provider RFC there is a community

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,620
remote inside of the spinnaker github

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,750
organization so it's just community and

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,400
there's a template inside of the RFC

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,800
directory inside there and you can just

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,000
copy that

00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,180
make it a file on the main employer

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,260
request and then people will start

00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,530
making comments to it the time when

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:07,180
itself gives a general flow for

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,950
potentially what you could fill in

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,230
that's totally optional to follow that

00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,790
convention and also gives some hints of

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,890
like hey this is the kind of content

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:22,780
that we'd be looking for side of this

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:24,670
section so my question is like I've been

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,760
into this daily for last ten months

00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,680
working at Salesforce so one aspect is

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,600
like the communities going to do but

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,100
another aspect is like long-range plan

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,840
like what is the vision an architect

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,520
like for example take for example club

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:45,400
record I come here everybody says that

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:47,050
there's a challenger Salesforce is like

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,540
you know not sleepy because of Tobruk

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,280
okay the stability issues of how it's

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,020
called scale and all these things so

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,610
what is the thinking around like long

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,280
term planning is there something

00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:01,090
top-down as a special interest group can

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,220
influence and understand what I do as a

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,770
question did everyone hear that question

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,790
so essentially if there's an issue like

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:12,180
car driver and the exact it's

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,180
fascinating at night

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,840
addressing the eye president also

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,400
perfectly initial as I think of top dog

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,990
rather than waiting for the come ability

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,550
to come to the there was this now use

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,650
the community chat so yeah it's their

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:31,570
proactive romantic like our evening is

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:33,280
this very convenient doing many so to be

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,050
like totally transparent this is

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,790
something that we're actively trying to

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,250
do we I think we actually just published

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:40,630
our first like cross organisation

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,870
roadmap with what everything is

00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:48,430
everybody's working on and I think part

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:51,010
of that effort is really starting to

00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,630
collaborate more across organizations I

00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,890
think governance gives us a really great

00:21:52,630 --> 00:22:00,010
medium or platform from which to do that

00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:01,930
where we take feedback right there's a

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,460
lot of different companies and SIG's in

00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,610
different organizations getting all of

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,700
this appeal back and that kind of like

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:12,640
higher level roadmap is kind of going to

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:16,180
be the result of that going forward as

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,460
far as like the lower level stuff like

00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,340
clouds our stability issues right that's

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,080
really where this is like the cigs are

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:26,290
going to be like the front line for all

00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,750
of that kind of stuff right and I think

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:32,020
to a certain extent we can predict so

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:34,300
that's really and Netflix you guys are

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,760
gonna have you're gonna have problems 12

00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,850
before the community has them but at the

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:43,270
same time you're the patterns at which

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:45,210
Netflix experiences different issues is

00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,830
going to be significantly different than

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,020
smaller organizations and organizations

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:54,520
using different cloud providers and so

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:56,860
it's part of the TOC responsibility and

00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,890
probably to start figuring out how to

00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,890
winterize I'm not

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,570
or anything specifically to figure out

00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,530
how to address that and how to make sure

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:12,620
we instill the confidence of the larger

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:13,820
I think I get this is still pretty new

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,280
and so this might be a little bit

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,980
aspirational but I think the way I sort

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,860
of see that happening is people bring

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,809
issues to the sea and the sea and the

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,970
sea Glee sort of noticing hey there's a

00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:27,920
more fundamental problem here I think

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,470
one example this didn't exactly call the

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,390
governance process but in kubernetes to

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,770
be noticed that people running to a lot

00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,960
of issues when they had a lot of

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,750
accounts but that was this thing came up

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,340
a lot during the kubernetes say it's 80

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,140
and that it was mostly was in the

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,910
kubernetes think we were able to solve

00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,059
that but I think once his six or

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,710
realizes haters have a more fundamental

00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,720
architectural problem here or something

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,220
that we might need to do that affects

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,020
the more than our sick or something that

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,040
we might need buy-in you know this is

00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,750
not something that we can just kind of

00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,410
do outside of our destiny we might buy

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:04,820
it I think we also have a it's by weekly

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:07,280
or monthly saline and TOC sync I think

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,960
that is a place where there's that

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,309
communication between SIG's and the

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,410
technical oversight to me so I think

00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:13,580
that you know particulars that you may

00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,470
need certainty I'm never gonna hear

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,210
about issues except through bubbling up

00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,190
through stakes but I think that I think

00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,870
that if this process is working well

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,940
those issues will bubble up through the

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,000
stage and then the technical Oversight

00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,280
Committee or the stairs

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,660
yes the case thing people nobody sees

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:32,070
issues have been raised by the same guy

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,870
can't see that's happen exactly if I

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,980
think that that's how I see that working

00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:41,850
wait so speaking of cloud remember let's

00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,350
let's go in on that whatsoever it's the

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,940
interface let's say two different cloud

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,430
providers and we mentioned there's an

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,380
AWS state and so the gentleman from

00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:53,010
Salesforce mentions he has challenges

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,420
cloud cover if I have challenges in the

00:24:53,010 --> 00:25:00,210
cloud driver and let's say I'm using

00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:02,190
Azure or gcpd or you know Zen where do I

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,380
get started like who do I talk to

00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,960
how do we talk about how filing issues

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,330
but what else like I've said a question

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,760
how do we find out who's like the most

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:18,810
knowledgeable or not together

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:22,710
where do I start so this is one of the

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:25,200
major issues that we solve relatively

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,970
recently and one of the proposed ideas

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,430
is that my introducing the code owners

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,290
it's all the different repos so that

00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:34,050
it's documented inside of each

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,180
individual repository of who are the

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,130
actual point of contacts Perkins I don't

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,340
like the piece of code and it's

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,880
specifically for for cloud driver you

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:46,620
can go into any other cloud providers

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:51,050
who are like the main contributors for

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:53,190
these particular pieces of code and

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:56,880
that's one way but if you want something

00:25:53,190 --> 00:26:01,020
a little bit more human contact and

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,810
touch the spinnaker slack is a great

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,830
point of contact and there's a

00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,080
operations channel as well as its

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,900
development channel for that channel and

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,250
depending on what you actually

00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,990
you can go into one of those channels

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,060
and start raising questions there will

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:17,660
be people that are domain experts that

00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:22,610
can respond one thing that the TOC

00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:24,530
really wants to add is a sink for every

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,570
cloud provider if you want to be inside

00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:30,620
of the stomach recording you're a cloud

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:34,190
provider you must have a safe they kind

00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,810
of overseas spinnaker is is a very large

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,700
leap like staying at one of the most

00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:40,190
large components of that is a particular

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,960
cloud provider so in this your case are

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,370
going to be reaching out to all the

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,540
different points of contact for these

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,130
different cloud providers and

00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,320
encouraging them to create things so

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,060
that users have a way to get in contact

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,070
with the people that are responsible for

00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,660
building these things and then being

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,810
able to bubble up issues that kind of

00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,810
thing

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,610
channel for everything so if you would

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,310
just went in this lacking certain sink -

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,620
you can see because we communicate

00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:11,180
directly with the leads and members of

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:13,370
each state and one initially if anyone

00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,860
has any ideas on how we can make this

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:20,450
process better we are more than welcome

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:27,200
to share those ideas any any idea is is

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:29,810
a good idea if you have an idea on how

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,610
to improve the governor's process the

00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,500
first point of contact I think would

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,750
probably need to create initiatives at

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:39,610
the community repo and described an

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:41,630
issue that you are experiencing and then

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:44,720
potential resolutions it doesn't even

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,460
propose a resolution is raising the fact

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:53,960
that there is an issue here is

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:55,370
first civilan last year and the two

00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,460
years ago with the spinner to sum that

00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:00,320
we we had a discussion about slack if

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,250
you are in the slide chat line you may

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,080
notice that we're using the free version

00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,190
and so there's no history it's just like

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,630
it's really good if you're like in the

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,070
moment you can get ahold of let's say

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,070
not you even have some questions but

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:26,440
actually my my point is don't leave Alan

00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:29,180
the community wanted a long different

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,170
place to ask questions and so we set up

00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,510
a forum and we recently were talking and

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,920
it was clear that the forum wasn't

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:56,630
getting a lot of love so what do we want

00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:59,060
to do about the forum I think we've just

00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:06,980
identified the issue that it's it's not

00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:09,410
a place that we think about slack that

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,850
when we start thinking about where are

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:14,450
the where's the tweeny trying to

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:17,290
communicate with us the the forum isn't

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:20,270
really warmest possibly think about and

00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:22,790
it's a challenge to maintain all these

00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,370
four avenues or four communication where

00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,470
you've got

00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,090
that are watching and interacting with

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,680
stackoverflow there's people that are

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,480
watching and interacting with our

00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,670
community format specific it seems

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:39,210
spinnaker and then there's slack and

00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:41,370
others gay I think that we would

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,130
probably do well to consolidate some of

00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:46,320
the avenues for communication and

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:48,840
specifically with regards to the forum I

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,550
think you probably folding night in to

00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,809
stack overflow or there's already a

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,580
whole lot of users that are already

00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:58,740
interacting with that platform that's

00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:00,809
probably the way forward but in this

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:05,370
plan on that there's a clear answer so

00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:06,960
what is going to happen with that we

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:13,830
would love to begin to get your feedback

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:17,460
on this whole process and problem does

00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:21,510
anyone in the audience use discourse the

00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:24,179
current spending therefore if you landed

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:27,030
there okay so there's one person the LXE

00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,950
who knows it exists okay so there's a

00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:33,559
few would there be any objections as we

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:38,880
shut it down okay that's good feedback

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:42,050
so there are we talked about there sings

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,650
there's TOC SC

00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:47,810
way to create requests comments we're

00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,040
gonna look at code ownership or at least

00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,270
a file so you can figure out who you're

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,250
talking to

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,410
even we already elaborated there's a

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,300
number of six that we don't exist or e

00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,550
to be created so we've been upgrading

00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,580
those let's talk about the other roles

00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:04,280
that be governance policy established in

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,560
that way are obviously advocating there

00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:10,250
is the notion of a viewer and then a

00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,890
notion of improver how does one know

00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:15,800
about becoming those things how is that

00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:25,880
process working and how can we make it

00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:27,650
better so like the other templates that

00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,420
we've mentioned like having a new club

00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,850
in writer making an RFC there are

00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:34,100
templates in the spinner slash community

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,020
you repo them for becoming an approver

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,610
interviewer and I don't know if I'll

00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,350
remember all the criteria off the top of

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,960
my head but the gist of it is that

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,970
you've been a consistent contributor I

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,030
think it's like a handful of meaningful

00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:49,220
code changes to the services that you

00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,980
want or he worship an approver above as

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:59,290
well as I think two to three members of

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:59,290
the community to sponsor it just to a

00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,210
slight correction when it comes to the

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,190
reviewer you don't actually have to make

00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,679
contributions it's just a matter of

00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:14,570
getting involved in the party bus that

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:18,169
exists and making a meaningful code

00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:19,760
review just getting in and sign become

00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:22,490
familiar with what kinda changes are

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,370
happening is the foundation for which we

00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:27,740
can start to get involved inside of -

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,210
the code of spinnaker and then from

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,240
there you can start making changes

00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:34,279
because of be more educated on different

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,830
moving pieces of that's where you launch

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:41,090
into the approver where we are expecting

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:43,070
a certain minimum bar of meaningful code

00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,289
new contributions from so that's kind of

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,909
the progression is that first emerges

00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:51,320
gang of evolved looking and getting

00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:53,059
feedback and then finally providing new

00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,440
code changes whether it be from a bunch

00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,440
of features with that kind of thing

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,150
[Music]

00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,610
is there a process by which you like

00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:10,769
let's say an image out so to speak are

00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:17,009
you to approver forever what happens

00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:21,299
here right now there's no explicit

00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:23,730
workflow or lifecycle around once

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:27,330
becoming a reviewer or once become an

00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,769
approver and you go expecting like you

00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:33,179
disappear from the community

00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:37,019
there's no it's languages apart I can

00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:38,580
recall that leaves us access but that's

00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:42,090
one of the things that we're looking at

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:45,600
you're valuating the sea is it something

00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:48,690
that you use it will lose it or if you

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,139
just get it once you keep it forever and

00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:55,919
it's a my personal opinion that you mean

00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:57,899
to use it or lose it because if someone

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,789
gets an approver access an item gives

00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,370
nothing access to click the green button

00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:04,259
on any border your best you kind of want

00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:06,059
to make sure that these people are still

00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:07,950
in touch with the community and it's

00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:09,720
gone some of the code base so they can

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,399
make a solid judgment call of whether or

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:15,419
not this is the actual thing that should

00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:18,179
get merged in if I were to just make up

00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:20,760
a requirement right now which I will I

00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,889
would say if you weren't active in the

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,369
community and say like 90 days I think

00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:28,589
that that would spawn the process of us

00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:31,500
reaching out and saying hey we haven't

00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:34,260
seen you around in a while what's going

00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,060
on and at least kickstart the process of

00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,490
like getting them folded back into the

00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,490
community rather than as immediately

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:10,250
okay so yes thank you I was wondering

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,240
about like talking about the seeds and

00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:16,010
the seeds has a purpose and the purpose

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:22,660
usually happens in time zones that are

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:26,060
in the US watch me mother draw from

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:29,030
people from South Africa they release a

00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:32,050
new time zone as me and says bothering

00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:36,320
you could we make some seats that are

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:39,350
basically not stays at the same level as

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:49,310
their us bones but the targeting tiny

00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:51,020
Thompson's basically some from what it's

00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,940
worth that I will hand it off so in the

00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,970
CDF this is also an open question

00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,760
because there are open saves and open

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:00,140
you know TOC important meetings accepted

00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,290
known on the boarding the co2 you see

00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,630
meaning part of the CDF is open and it's

00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,790
at 9:00 a.m. Pacific and it's unfriendly

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,170
to those let's say an Asian and so

00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,660
there's an open question of like what we

00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:13,880
do about that so at the CDF level that

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,580
the ideas that will hold the meetings at

00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,410
different game

00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,480
it's like a different time so we'll do

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,980
it by weekly but like at 9:00 a.m. you

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,750
know this week and then in two weeks we

00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,490
hold it at 9:00 p.m. type thing so

00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,080
that's an idea at the CDF level to

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,820
address different time zones I have been

00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:32,460
curious and then you had a question so

00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:33,900
I'll let them rip on them so I just

00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,990
learned to clarify you said something

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,760
like a sig that's not the same level was

00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,860
like the other states I think it's

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,260
totally reasonable that we addressed

00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:46,350
that problem and that we would actually

00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,110
love to have people in different time

00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:51,300
zones more diverse participation in

00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:53,760
SIG's so I think that's really important

00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,230
for us too the first time ins come on my

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,230
radar but I'm fairly

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:05,980
and encourage the state leads to get a

00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,960
pulse on who's attending they're saying

00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,040
come up with a consensus with what to

00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,500
make sense with of who's actually

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,450
participating in it so if you're driving

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,090
an initiative that has a big european

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:45,820
attendees attender ship and I can make

00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:49,060
that friendly question to all the

00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,920
nominees I always like your stick the

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,290
confession is kept on Google Docs use

00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,450
Google Hangouts and those are not

00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:58,060
accessible in certain countries

00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:01,030
I asked Mississippi FSM and they want to

00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:04,240
Qatar for the agenda of meeting

00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:07,570
information we have in class obviously

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:14,590
stood encourage or even make it easier

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:17,860
for people to join now that I hear that

00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:20,490
yeah there's there's really no reason

00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,950
process I know on that so

00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,720
need something to make the governments

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,560
more accessible and more transparent

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:33,930
than there's really no reason to do that

00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:35,130
just a great question what what the

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:39,650
science of people hang out would be

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,650
better I mean that's a heavy right here

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,940
keep that money background there is

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,410
Google meat isn't available in China and

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,970
we found out our Google Docs is not

00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,339
available so that the Chinese diets

00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,800
couldn't participate so this is granted

00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:07,410
guys about this up I trusted you still

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:23,940
have that are one of the expectations

00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:25,560
that we're getting out of the CD the

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,420
expectations of the CD on there are to

00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,980
build a better and stronger community I

00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,720
would say the expectations when the

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,490
spinner community is that by joining the

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,339
city if we have a stronger community I

00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:37,770
think it's still too early to say yes or

00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,510
no that it's happening it's worth noting

00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:41,790
that the CDF is still spinning up and so

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,730
we're spending a lot of time as a let's

00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:47,369
say or figuring out what does it mean

00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:49,290
CDSs not a surprise when the slack also

00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:50,460
that's history I'd be surprised at the

00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,290
CDF pick that up

00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,670
that's awesome and then stuff like that

00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,500
is really will grow so it's about from

00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,079
the city s in terms of the then picking

00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,450
up our infrastructure costs if you

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,579
aren't aware you know budding slag and

00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,930
discourse all these cost money and you

00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:06,270
know companies like Google and Netflix

00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,099
up and you know putting up money and I

00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:11,670
gave me the CD if I do that so I'm

00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:14,160
willing to give does he have more time

00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:16,140
so that we could figure out if we get

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,150
all the benefits we wanted but it's been

00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:30,180
a little slow that's I think anyone

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:34,349
would even say that yes what's the best

00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:38,640
way for an engineer to determine the

00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:40,910
current sort of release process in terms

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,440
of like high-level Batista's at 1.15

00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:51,000
1016 how does someone know we're in the

00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:53,750
cadence we are and what tests what the

00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:00,299
types of integration tests have been run

00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:02,660
yeah and a stranger from the macaroons

00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:06,480
didn't answer the question

00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:09,390
hi everyone my name is Travis I am in

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,559
charge of taking the build release

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:13,440
process that is currently on the

00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,920
google.com infrastructure importing that

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,809
into something that is both viewable and

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,400
contributor bull by the community right

00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,440
now we've been running for the last

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,180
three or four years on the build

00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,900
releases we've gone through a very a

00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,960
couple of generations of process on

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,390
Jenkins and that

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,130
growing organically and out of control a

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,980
lot of my college credentials and a lot

00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:38,790
of stuff that we did because it was only

00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:41,230
Google engineers that had access to that

00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:43,660
that is something that I'm working on

00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:46,420
over the next several weeks of trying to

00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,250
get that cleaned up and I could that

00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,609
kicked out the door so that actually had

00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:55,359
external to Google contributors doing

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:57,849
like 90 and like patch releases build

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,680
cop duties just kind of like the general

00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,060
chores and maintenance of the project

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,369
are kind of trying to get that off of

00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:07,210
trying to get back into the hands of the

00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:17,410
exposure for the community so hit me up

00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:19,060
on slack if you want to was address

00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,640
which is you asked like how do we figure

00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:28,060
out where we are in the release process

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:32,560
are the current royalties like seventeen

00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:35,160
I think that's a good opportunity for us

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,349
to go more transparency around them I

00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:42,730
hear that question a lot I think roughly

00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:45,220
is six to eight weeks per release and

00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,380
then we've done a really good job so far

00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,119
like communicating when we kick off the

00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,960
release window but we don't have a

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,630
really good

00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:58,059
like how far into our movies when they

00:42:52,630 --> 00:43:00,460
were into a development timeframe but

00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:02,800
currently on spinnaker dot IO there is a

00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:05,349
release Keaton's page that will list the

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,880
upcoming work for future releases into

00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,470
their target date and that date is

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,240
generally 1 we will cut the release

00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:12,099
branches in each service and then

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,349
generally approximately one week forward

00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:15,880
from that is when we will consider in

00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:18,339
Fable its pass an immigration test and

00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,440
it will be released and additionally on

00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:22,540
that page it will list the latest stable

00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,740
version length of each minor version

00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:29,530
sirs I don't know what you should update

00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:33,730
in each case okay in the last two

00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:35,800
minutes we have speed run priority so

00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,440
we're coming in with the end of 2019 so

00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,000
when you look at 2020 in the context of

00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,619
spinnaker governance and the various

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,780
rules you all play within the community

00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,430
what's the one thing you want to see

00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:52,869
improved what's like what's your big

00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:56,740
party I would love to get just early

00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:59,290
feedback on on new features and then

00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,540
event that just means dropped into the

00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,130
drop in the SIG's voice your opinion

00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,400
there's no right or wrong it's just

00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:08,619
about building consensus so it's much

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,099
better to be proactive about voicing the

00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:15,390
opinion before we start taking the wrong

00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:18,640
hole no matter what the initiative is

00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:21,280
for me it's simplifying the developer

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,059
experience of spinnaker itself that it

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,099
is in two wickets one if you are there

00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:28,869
is a lot of hunger inside the community

00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:31,839
to actually get involved and get started

00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:32,970
with things and it's difficult to get

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,099
started in

00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,140
during the spinnaker so the first part

00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:40,710
is making it easier to get started and

00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:43,109
then the second part is simplifying and

00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,210
standardized more of the development of

00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:47,310
these individual surfaces if you look at

00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,740
any particular service there's going to

00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,359
be a myriad of different testing tools

00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,339
that are languages and that sort of

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,230
thing and when you are trying to

00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:56,430
contribute a larger feature you have to

00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,069
the context switches between the

00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:01,740
services service and that is if economic

00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:04,230
shell gossip is but then in some cases

00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,700
you end up having to context switch on

00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,829
the tooling that you are using to

00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,589
implement these features and that is too

00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:12,000
much context and unnecessary so one of

00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:15,359
the things that I would like to see is

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,609
an improvement we're not going to fix

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:22,800
that us in the weird but I'd like to see

00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:27,119
getting that solved to know what Rob

00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:30,150
said and add that just plug there is a

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,569
current RFC proposal for a mentorship

00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:35,609
program out on the community repo it's

00:45:33,569 --> 00:45:38,369
something that I'm pretty interested in

00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:40,200
Rob and myself and Emily all kind of

00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:43,710
came up with this idea and her a few

00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:46,020
months ago but it's something that we'd

00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:49,940
love to care and new contributors with

00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:53,310
existing kind of more seasoned

00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:55,050
contributors and so if you you're

00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:58,200
interested in that or do you just want

00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,329
like voice here at +1 or thumbs down

00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:05,760
just go check out the proposal and let

00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:07,260
us know this is a little bit bigger it

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,579
covers a lot of things that we've

00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,079
touched over the course of this but I

00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:14,450
just love to see you over the course of

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,450
the next year ice make it a lot easier

00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,230
that are streamlining our mission triage

00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,450
process getting that done and also being

00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:26,250
better about my tiara so make sure those

00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,990
don't steal for as long as people have a

00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,370
good experience when these during this

00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:33,630
community and we have more people drink

00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,160
to those in the membership they need

00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,990
more community involvement and I think

00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,640
specifically one thing that might be

00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:40,170
really cool for spending or some of our

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,460
other meetups in the coming year would

00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:43,530
be having kind of like an in-person

00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,090
community but batch where we've kind of

00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,920
accumulated a lot of big enough friendly

00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,900
issues and you can get in person

00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:55,370
membership membership remember the

00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:57,190
community does all that so let's go

00:46:55,370 --> 00:47:00,869
clause

00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,869
[Applause]

00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:07,020
- rio branco there is another panel

00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:08,490
session on road map so this is kind of a

00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,410
continuation of this discussion so I'd

00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,180
love to see MIT there and I thought this

00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,710
was an amazing conversation and that we

00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,750
actually got some real-time feedback in

00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:17,160
terms of like being more inclusive for

00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,990
our friends outside the United States

00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,450
both in times of us but also different

00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:23,520
technologies so this is awesome please

00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:26,369
keep your questions in comments and

00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,200
feedback you know coming we are we're

00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:30,390
learning as we're going and we very much

00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,760
learners to be an inclusive awesome

00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,140
community and it starts by like you all

00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,470
being warned wrong so thank you very

00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,470
much

00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:42,420
[Applause]
