[Laughter]

00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:21,020
there was a well thank you so much for

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,439
having me I really appreciate being here

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:27,110
as Pete said my name is Sina Brahm and I

00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,939
am here to talk to you about thinking

00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,189
about all users thinking about all the

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:33,949
different types of users that the stuff

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,540
that we create might might you know they

00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:37,460
might encounter and they might have

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,330
differing abilities so what is that what

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,150
does that really mean

00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,540
right but before we get before we get

00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:47,059
started I'd go over this this general

00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,500
rule which is um you know because you

00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,059
some of you saw me coming up here with a

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,129
cane that means I happened to be blind

00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:54,379
so if I ask you some questions which I

00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,730
will do during this talk nodding or

00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:57,920
raising your hand is not gonna really

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,110
work out too well for me or for you and

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,360
so we're going to dispense with that so

00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,680
if I ask you a question just be verbal

00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,050
if you're able with your response like

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,270
yes does that make sense okay how's the

00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,280
tests of the know nodding we're off to a

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,410
good start you'll see some hashtags at

00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,850
the bottom of the the slides one is for

00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,410
the conference of course my twitter

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,979
handle is on there I'll just read it out

00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:23,090
for accessibility best practices si ma

00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:25,330
bah ra em and you'll also notice a a 11

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,259
why is anyone seen this hashtag before

00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,270
alright and so it stands for

00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,849
accessibility it's a numeron em right

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,399
and it's the 11 letters that are removed

00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:37,250
from the word the CCE ssib iolite ii

00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:40,970
i18n is internationalisation alt an end

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:44,000
of localization etc right constraints on

00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:47,300
old file systems have have their effects

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,800
even to this day and so that by the way

00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,440
i just talked about that hashtag because

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,360
it's a great opportunity it's a great

00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,750
group of people and tribe of people

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,940
online to really learn from and if you

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,560
have questions about this stuff to talk

00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,360
about there's a little bit about myself

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,190
I run a company called prime access

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,840
control consulting or pack pac-12 work

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,160
in the inclusive design space and I'm

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,989
gonna be explaining what that is an

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,450
accessibility I'll be talking about all

00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:17,450
of those definitions and we work with

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,360
everybody from museums to startups to

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:24,260
venture funds to to anybody universities

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,610
on any types of issues where we can use

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,980
technology to make thing

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,810
better make physical interfaces better

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,190
for everybody I happen to be blind but

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,380
we concentrate on everything from

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,270
hearing to differences of language to

00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,090
differences of identity and how do we

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,380
make these environments more inclusive

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,570
so that's what we do from mobile

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,310
websites augmented reality blocks based

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,350
programming environments too and 3d

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,940
environments you name it how do we make

00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,010
this stuff more accessible so that's

00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,740
what I get to play with on a daily basis

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:54,830
a little bit of in terms of background

00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,810
when I was very young I lost most of my

00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,130
visions with around the age of 7 or so I

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,290
didn't have perfect vision to start off

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,640
with but I was playing I had a little

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,560
you know I had more than I do now

00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,940
explain tennis against the backboard he

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,070
was practicing serving that kind of

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,070
thing I missed one of the shots my face

00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,959
did and so that you know basically it

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,370
resulted in me losing most of my vision

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,140
in my right eye so you can think of me

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,120
as as mostly blind right I have some

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,860
light perception but I read Braille at

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,630
travel with a cane I have a screen

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,520
reader talking to me in my ear which I'm

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,930
gonna be demoing for you guys in a few

00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,950
minutes I'm not just up here listening

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,260
to music as I give this presentation

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,600
right so it's reading me my slide

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,310
contents as I'm talking to you right so

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,019
long story short went to school for

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,780
computer science so I have undergraduate

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,850
and graduate degrees in income SCI abd

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,280
and a PhD in computer science as I

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,860
decided to leave the ph.d program and go

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,209
off and run the company and work on

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,760
trying to make these various

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:49,160
technologies more inclusive but my

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,440
research concentrated on multimodal ways

00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,410
of exploring spatial information things

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,970
like bar charts maps graphs that kind of

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,110
thing how do you use a little bit of

00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,970
machine learning touch screen

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,880
technologies voice recognition to

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,980
explore that stuff in a multimodal way

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,840
so that if you can't see or you can't

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,570
hear there's other sensors there's other

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,730
modalities we can use to present that

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,290
kind of information and thereby make it

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,690
better for everybody not just somebody

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,590
who needs speech or who need large print

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:22,790
or who needs it zoomed in them except oh

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:23,750
so I wanted to just briefly go over or

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,669
what we're going to talk about we're

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,080
gonna define a few terms you know get

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,840
some definitions out of the way get on

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,250
the same page then go over a little bit

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,650
about just why this matters why are we

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,990
talking about this stuff right go into

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,150
some digital accessibility concepts that

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,770
I

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,330
think is very relevant for everybody in

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,670
the room and and and things that I'm

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,010
very passionate about right and then do

00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,230
the fun stuff right like demo in the

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,520
assistive technology show you some

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,050
things that I think are pretty

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,000
interesting that I hope you are too and

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,610
then conclude with some some some final

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,100
thoughts all right so a couple of

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,080
definitions right the first one is

00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,940
accessibility I've mentioned it a couple

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,250
of times but what does it really mean

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,320
right and so it's the ability of all

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,440
people to use a product a service

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,300
offering right a place independent of

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,580
disability and this is really important

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,250
that the definition of accessibility is

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,680
rooted in this in this reference to

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,050
disability so we should probably ask

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,630
being technical folks therefore what is

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,130
disability right so disability is the

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,020
consequence of an impairment

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,620
this can be sensory like olfactory

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,390
vision like myself hearing mobility the

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,920
ability to use your feet for bipedal

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,140
locomotion you name it right it can be

00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,330
mental or cognitive in nature right

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,690
dyslexia ADHD that side that sort of

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,790
thing it can be emotional or you know

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,220
depression anxiety any of these things

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,790
all of these things can in combinations

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,980
therein can combine to form some form of

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,620
impairments some type of impairment and

00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,080
how we think about this and how we think

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,720
about people who have some form of

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,310
impairment is the the topic that I want

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,920
to talk to you a little bit about today

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,530
so there's two classic ways of thinking

00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,300
about disability but I want to really

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,240
stress something before we get started

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,580
this there's an entire field of critical

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,680
disability studies Wikipedia Reddit and

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,870
Twitter or your friends you know go go

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
forth and and and really deeply you know

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,200
dig deep into this rabbit hole if you

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,120
like I'm not trying to present these two

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,610
as the only two ways of thinking about

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,060
disability but they are two useful ways

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,340
of kind of contrasting some some very

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,230
popular beliefs around it right so the

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,700
first way is the medical model I think

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,380
most of us are familiar with this you

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,810
break your arm you go to the doctor

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,420
hopefully it heals right you get a cast

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,290
that sort of thing what happens and

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,790
there's nothing wrong with that right

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,950
like we have medical science we can

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,830
improve things what happens when that

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,780
doesn't work what happens when

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,669
can't restore the vision or you cannot

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,159
restore the hearing right where you

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:54,409
cannot restore the the spinal cord

00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,409
function right so then we view in the

00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:59,180
medical model as the person having a

00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:02,210
disability we view them as broken or

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,650
impaired in some way right now if we can

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,360
trust this with the social model of

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,860
disability it's it's pretty stark

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,629
because in the social model disability

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,229
we don't consider the individual as

00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:14,690
being disabled we ended we consider the

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:16,310
environment as being disabling right the

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,780
fact that you're juggling crutches and

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,969
can't open the door because there's no

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,340
automatic door opener it's not your

00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:24,710
fault for meeting crutches it is the

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,960
fault of the building for not having a

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,099
door opener does this make sense so

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,110
those are two different ways of thinking

00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:33,229
about disability so how do we make our

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,330
environments less disabling right and

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,800
that's where we get into inclusive

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,830
design some people may have heard of

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,139
Universal Design yes a few there was a

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,330
few and so the inclusive design

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,889
basically is this design methodology

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,409
that we use the beginning this can be

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,759
for software hardware architecture you

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,430
name it anything where we're making

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,860
stuff especially stuff that will be used

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,840
by people right and it puts the person

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,490
at the heart of the design process right

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,039
it's really as simple as that it's

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,039
building in things like being adaptive

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,650
into our interfaces flexibility and not

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,300
assuming a nominal or perfect user not

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,919
assuming my user has perfect vision

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,940
therefore I can use color coding to

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,650
convey information my user has perfect

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,180
reading ability therefore a paragraph of

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,330
highly technical text is appropriate

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,490
right it's allowing us to think about

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,800
how users will have differing needs and

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,409
then making our things adaptable and

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,300
flexible enough to accommodate that does

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:30,529
that make sense okay some common

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,819
examples of this are things like curb

00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:33,440
cuts of course right that's a very

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:34,760
common example that's used you guys are

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,500
familiar with this the little ramp that

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,969
goes down from a sidewalk so if your

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,550
wheelchair user you don't have to hop at

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,440
her but who uses that the most it's

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,060
parents with strollers right it's the

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,589
people with luggage at the airport so

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,079
even though it's critical for one

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:50,209
audience it is helpful or augmentative

00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:51,650
for everybody that that's the kind of

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,470
emergent benefit you get

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,400
it's not just for those people

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,500
quote-unquote right it's not for other

00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,780
people it's for everybody even though

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,940
it's critical for some people and by the

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,410
way quick thing with curb cuts is an

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,000
example of something launching into

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,470
production with a few bugs in it right

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,790
well not I mean would you know we're

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,260
pretty familiar with that I would say

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,790
right so like what is what is the

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,410
consequence of the first curb cuts well

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,640
they didn't have those bumps on them you

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,440
guys have know what I'm talking about

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,000
the little dome the dots that you see on

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,980
curb cuts right sometimes that's

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,210
colloquially called foot Braille right

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,250
there are no hidden messages I have

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,370
checked that is a lost opportunity for

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,500
city planners and so the idea there is

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,030
why are those there well what I was

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,040
happening was they were really smooth

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,690
and imagine like a Parkway like a like a

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,240
driveway in a parking garage kind of

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,890
thing there's a really gentle incline so

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,900
if you're a blind pedestrian you're

00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,340
traveling along and you could be in the

00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,350
middle of the street without knowing it

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,390
now if you combine this with silent

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,880
electric cars it turns out the Tesla's

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,390
hurt when they hit you so what do we do

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,700
about that

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,280
we don't go oh snap guess we're not

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,050
doing curb cuts anymore right we iterate

00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,820
and we fail forward so this is an idea

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,560
of we're not always gonna get it right

00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,750
the first time let's please not let

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,610
perfection be the enemy of the good does

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:06,440
that does that make sense awesome

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:08,390
alright so in terms of why this matters

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,100
I just wanted to quickly go over a few

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,870
things here so the first thing I lead

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,970
off with is it's simply the right thing

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,800
to do right this is a quote from Tim

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,240
Cook CEO of Apple right he says when we

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,440
can make work on making our devices

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,390
accessible for the blind

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,770
I don't consider the bloody ROI I don't

00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,600
consider the return on investment this

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,070
is he was getting needled by an investor

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,290
at one of the board meetings a few years

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,420
back and this was about as out bursty as

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,370
Tim Cook you know guess like this was

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,620
this is this is considered very out of

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,270
the norm fram and so this was a really

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,400
important message though because they

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,140
tend to walk this talk no one's perfect

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,820
but Apple really does tend to walk this

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,850
talk in terms of accessibility there's

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,260
tens of thousands of dollars of

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,450
assistive technology built into every

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,400
single iPhone Apple watch Apple TV

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,930
MacBook etc right they have screen

00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,850
reading built-in screen enlargement

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,440
things for switch face users I'll talk

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,150
about that in a little bit there's a lot

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,770
of stuff built in there and they've been

00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,170
walking this talk up it's the right

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,870
thing to do not an accessibility add-on

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,640
after the

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,900
but let's make the environment inclusive

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,640
so I think that's that's really

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,680
important so that's one way of looking

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,900
at it another way of looking at it is

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,640
the numbers simply don't lie over a

00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,920
billion people in the world have some

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,660
form of impairment or disability 110 to

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,890
190 million of them have a severe

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,750
impairment and these numbers are not

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,370
going down they're going up the Frank

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,200
reason used to be perfectly blunt with

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,420
you is babies aren't dying and as a

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,770
result that's good right but they may

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,220
grow up with one or more disabilities

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,930
and so this is the nature of humanity

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,010
and you want to fast forward a little

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,170
bit from here you can look at places

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,390
like Japan and parts of Asia where they

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,520
have more elderly populations over the

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,830
age of 35 your chances of getting a

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,690
disability is one out of two okay one

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,670
out of two so that's fifty percent so

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,040
this is not something that just affects

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,570
a small portion of the population so if

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,980
you're more of a numbers person this is

00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,620
another way of thinking about why this

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,330
stuff is important and then lastly and I

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,880
don't like to concentrate on this a lot

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,460
there's plenty of other people that do

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,380
it's it's legally mandated especially in

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,840
this country in Europe and Canada now

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,510
Australia this is not something that

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,830
that is that is a light mandate anymore

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,980
right there's things like the ad yeah

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,900
there's 508 there's all of these other

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,650
you know education related legislation

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,690
the cvaa

00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,990
so there's all these legal reasons for

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:21,330
doing it and frankly if you do the work

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,970
of accessibility and making our things

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,100
inclusive you get a lot of this

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,080
compliance for free out of that kind of

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,850
effort and you end up getting a massive

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,250
ROI in terms of more customers and

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,810
everything it's just simply

00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,000
mathematically it makes sense to do this

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,710
now it's not an additional burden and

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,840
every time someone does that proper risk

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,670
analysis it comes out to actually being

00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,260
you know being being profitable and

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,840
being the right thing to do so does that

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,890
make sense okay awesome

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,360
so in terms of digital accessibility I

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,870
wanted to talk to you guys a little bit

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,780
about some different ways that persons

00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,550
that use assistive technologies you know

00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,440
what what are those examples of those

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,540
different ways right so I talked briefly

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,310
about a screen reader and I'll not talk

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,530
too much about that one because I'll be

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,300
demoing that for you in just a minute

00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,610
but there's also things like a Braille

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,529
display right so this is a

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,120
refreshable Braille display is a device

00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,769
that you put in front of you usually in

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,620
front of your keyboard and it has little

00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,360
pins that are actuated up and down and

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,040
so you can make Braille up here under

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,230
your fingers right this is especially

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,260
helpful for somebody who's let's say

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,120
deafblind right who doesn't who has no

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,380
ability to hear the screenreader but

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
they still want to be able to use the

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,700
computer through a screen reading

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,810
software so they can use a Braille

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,310
display it's also helpful for

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,519
proofreading some people prefer it for

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,540
code that sort of thing right for low

00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,220
vision you know there's things like

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,310
screen enlargement text enlargements

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,290
dooming in right color mappings and you

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,300
know dark mode is becoming very popular

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,339
these days right converted color modes

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,680
because all of these things are ways of

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,329
adapting our interfaces so that people

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,070
with various abilities or various

00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,670
requirements can use them this is all

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,350
make sense okay in terms of physical

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,029
impairments you have things like sticky

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,500
keys ever hit the shift key a couple of

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:08,870
times on your keyboard and the dialog

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,399
box comes up about enabling sticky keys

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,500
well that's really important for

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,300
something that very limited dexterity

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,800
because it lets you mash a bunch of keys

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,170
on the way to the one that you're going

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,480
to but it will ignore all of those right

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,970
it lets you use a keyboard with one hand

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,920
only because it gives you enough time to

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,410
do shortcuts like if you want to do ctrl

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,329
C you can press the ctrl key then move

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,769
your finger over and press C if you

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:32,630
don't have the ability to do that with

00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,250
one hand so sticky keys is something

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,829
that's built into our operating systems

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,140
and is really really really helpful for

00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:40,670
people who need that right there's

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,529
one-handed keyboards there's hardware

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,699
keyboards that perform this job those

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,860
are really fun to play with if you've

00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:47,660
never played with one there's things

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,220
like eye tracking voice based

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,320
programming all of these different

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,779
things and the real takeaway from this

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,790
slide is like to show there's all this

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,560
stuff out there in the world we only

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,660
have to necessarily worry about that

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,699
there's other people working on those

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,800
kinds of things what we need to worry

00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:05,500
about is making the web content that we

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,540
create or that our scripts create

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,980
accessible and programmatically

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,870
extensible in ways that all of these

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,029
different technologies can take

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,709
advantage of it and can facilitate we

00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,560
don't have to be an expert in how for

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,450
example Steven

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,210
I used a computer he was a he was a

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,490
switch user so he had a sensor on his

00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,350
jaw muscle he would actuate his jaw

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,080
muscle and he would offer ask for

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,120
physics books by a purser moving across

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,950
the screen and you know he had

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,940
autocomplete before a lot of us did

00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,850
right that's where that kind of

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,950
technology came from suggestions texting

00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,870
on your phone came from deaf people

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,820
communicating over TV why even the

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,770
typewriter Ryan came came out of that

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,820
the dendogram Bell with them you know

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,370
with the phone we have all of these

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,290
examples of technologies that have come

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,120
out of solving problems in the

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,560
disability space we don't have to be

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,089
experts in that stuff well we need to do

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,920
is make sure the code we're writing the

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,510
websites the dashboards the different

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,480
interfaces that we're creating and that

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,550
we're buying are accessible so that they

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:08,640
can facilitate that level of access does

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:11,220
that make sense okay so in terms of web

00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,990
accessibility um who here has heard of

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,140
the web content accessibility guidelines

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,860
or Wieck Agra for short cool all right

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,930
so it's a set of functional requirements

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,460
excuse me published by the w3c and the

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,990
World Wide Web Consortium and it's a set

00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,360
of requirements that essentially lays

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,370
out success right here for what it means

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,160
for a website and also for example for a

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,050
mobile app to be accessible it's not

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,480
everything that can be done there's

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,620
always more but it's a really good set

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,570
of rules um

00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,890
there's plenty of resources on this I

00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,440
spend a lot of time working with

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,970
everybody from developers to you know

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,890
senior management on things like week

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,660
add conformance and how you get there

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,640
and how you make things accessible but I

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,440
just want to mention it because it's a

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,510
good set of rules and I think it should

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,770
be on everyone's radar in terms of

00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,170
somebody saying okay well what is it

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:00,330
mean for something to be accessible most

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,060
definitions eventually all of those

00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,050
roads come back to wick okay so that's

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,720
something that should be on your radar

00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,939
there's what a 2.0 and 2.1 just so you

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,770
know 2.1 is the update it's a full

00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,630
superset of 2.0 so if you're ever

00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,040
looking at something and you see weak

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,280
acupoint one it's simply the more

00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,839
up-to-date tools there's three levels a

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,610
double-a triple-a almost everybody

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,949
conforms to double-a when they're trying

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,709
to to conform that's where it's at so

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,780
weak had 2.1 double-a means that all

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,570
right we're doing most of those things

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,130
that allow our website mobile app etc to

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,560
be accessible to the widest possible

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,910
audience does that make sense okay

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,130
awesome and I'll show you some

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,440
consequences of that when we dive into

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,420
the demo here in a second a couple of

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,890
tips and tricks so I can you know I have

00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,090
a few minutes with you guys I just want

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,160
to make sure I cover some of these

00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,380
because we see a lot of this when we're

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
using you know fonts and colors and that

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,900
sort of thing

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,300
it's perfectly fine to use colors to

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,010
convey information we are visual beings

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,990
we use color all the time

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,510
nothing wrong with that it's just don't

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,700
use color alone to convey information

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,770
when you say the required stuff is the

00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,170
stuff in red that's where it's not cool

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,150
right but if you have a red star or red

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,580
asterisk and you also use the required

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,800
attribute in HTML now we're good does

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,050
that difference make sense okay so

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,430
that's really critical right with images

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,490
and graphics have people heard of alt

00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,890
text yeah use it right so when we have

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,450
an IMG you need to always have an alt

00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,000
wrapped attribute sometimes that off can

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,470
be empty that's fine but always have

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,510
that right it's really really critical

00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,280
these are very little things that we can

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,470
do there's characters of code but it

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,250
will save people hours of use time

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:40,080
things like tables right or do focus in

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,500
the room how many people speak HTML in

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,280
this room yes okay cool so the th tag

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,590
for our tables how many people use that

00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,270
okay so that's really critical because

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,700
when you make that first row of your

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,810
table its he had and you make you use

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,520
those th tags

00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,710
that's what then allows someone like me

00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,720
to come along use that table I can be 30

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,250
rows down but I'll know what column I'm

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,710
in I'll know what row I'm in because

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,420
those table headers matter right so this

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,430
stuff that's like little semantic stuff

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,900
is really really really important

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,150
because sometimes it's just a few

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,020
characters of code it makes all of the

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,700
difference in the world it doesn't

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,140
change the way it visually looks so it's

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,760
easy for us to ignore it right it's not

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,800
out of malice it's just we just

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,080
sometimes forget but it's really

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,060
critical to get that stuff right because

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,650
it makes a significant impact when

00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,420
people are using the interface in a

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,130
different way like with a screen reader

00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,350
does that make sense okay

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,880
and remember golden rule of HTML every

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,070
single thing on the web starts out as

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,270
being 100% accessible it's everything we

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,850
do to it that makes it inaccessible

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,740
right like the that div is excessive

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,450
when you decide to put an image behind

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,100
it and put an on click on it and pretend

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,289
it's a button instead of using an actual

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,690
button tag that's when we have a problem

00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:51,480
right so when we use those semantics

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,610
that HTML provides you're already 90% of

00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,740
the way there does that make sense okay

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,940
so a couple of other things there's an

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,620
accessibility checker when we're making

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,779
office documents make sure to use that

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,090
it's built into Word and PowerPoint it

00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:05,909
gives you some heads some head up some

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,080
some some some call-outs for exactly the

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:09,600
kind of things that I'm talking about

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,519
heading order lists links that sort of

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,580
thing it warns you about that right and

00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,590
lastly with respect to PDF always save

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,779
as a PDF if you can instead of printing

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,759
to a PDF so the text content makes it

00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:22,110
through and consider epub how many

00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:25,049
people are familiar with epub in Israel

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,179
okay that's awesome so you know epubs

00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,830
fantastic it's standards-based you can

00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,360
do things like math ml inside of it

00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,070
which makes the math accessible you can

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,259
do entire textbooks in it it's a

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,059
fantastic format and I really I just

00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:39,720
like to encourage people to use them all

00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:41,669
right so let's dive in to what I think

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,980
is some of the fun stuff so I'm forgive

00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:46,190
me for a second while I escape out of

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,190
this

00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,769
[Applause]

00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:04,870
if I can get some volume there we go

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,630
cool right this is how I use a computer

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:14,880
[Music]

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:31,720
so we can write windows subsystem for

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:33,910
Linux whatever right so pretty

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,760
straightforward really easy to do

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:39,910
however I am told it's a little fast

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,910
[Music]

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,860
how's that we good all right don't be

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,480
shy all right it's important that you

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,150
understand what it's saying so let me

00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,950
know all right cool so this is not 950

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,770
words minute this probably around some

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,300
time it's probably like 120 hundred 30

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,030
words per minute I tend to talk a little

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,410
fast so I I I'm probably up around 150 I

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,530
think valley girls 180 if I'm not

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,910
mistaken so that's that's couldn't

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,020
happen tipsy glue what you're hearing

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,420
here is just a text-to-speech

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,950
synthesizer it's the it's the screen

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,050
reader that I happen to be using and

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,050
it's reading me the screen so if we go

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,059
over like

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,590
there's no pad I'm just using all tab to

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:31,200
navigate around because obviously not

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:33,300
using the mouse right we can right so I

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,600
can do that notice the difference

00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:39,900
between this and this it's a difference

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,300
there right so it's a higher pitch right

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,100
so we're not gonna waste three syllables

00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,130
of my life with the word capital right

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,690
so a multi-modal exploration multimodal

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,970
information is really important here

00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,140
right like I only have so much time and

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,640
I already got to deal with an accessible

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,820
experience is the last thing I need is

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,610
extra words right so that that idea of

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,260
using the audio channel effectively is

00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:06,120
super important right we can navigate

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:11,160
phonetically right we can navigate you

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:12,510
know for the geeks of the room which

00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,100
actually does come in handy we're like

00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:21,720
reading assembler output and stuff so

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:22,920
you know that that was useful and so we

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,510
got a lot of information there cut

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,850
controlled what's ax

00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,140
unavailable T so he told me it was

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,970
unavailable not because I don't have

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,580
anything highlighted nothing to cut it

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,620
told me the mnemonic in the menu T

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,110
that's the letter you press in the menu

00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,350
to quickly do that thing right it told

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,760
me the global shortcut key ctrl X right

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,500
and of course it told me what was cut

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,020
right does that make sense all of those

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,309
pieces of information so that is the

00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,330
kind of stuff this is just needed but

00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:50,610
the person who wrote the notepad

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,530
application in Windows did not need to

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,600
know about screen readers they just

00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,880
needed to know look I populate the

00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,890
following strings and magic happens and

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,330
the magic is accessibility API is and

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,650
all this other stuff that runs in the

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,120
background if you got questions on it

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,340
I'm happy to geek out with it you know

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,510
with you about it but like they didn't

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,030
have to know that they just have to know

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,920
to fill in the appropriate metadata so

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,140
that the interface was accessible is

00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,820
that make sense okay so and notice like

00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,130
you didn't say things like grayed out

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,130
it said unavailable so it's getting me

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,590
the semantics of what I need to know not

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,030
reading me the visual thing right

00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,710
because there's a different than this is

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,420
something HTML tries to bring home to us

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,770
right there's a decoupling between

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,650
present

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:33,780
and content and proper inclusive design

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,130
and accessibility really just hammers

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:43,500
that point home that we should be

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:44,790
coupled these two concepts I thought

00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,020
this would be cute so this like this

00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,420
going to grow rich PDF page right

00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,490
obviously different different concept

00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,320
more around nautical and sailing right

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,970
so I wanted to just highlight a couple

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,580
things headings on the web people are

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,930
familiar with this concept yes okay cool

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:03,380
what are headings used for somebody want

00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:03,380
to shut that up come on guys

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:10,430
say them metadata that's that's that's

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,430
keep going

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,610
structure I heard structure that's

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:18,180
that's that out or headings used to make

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:21,960
text bigger they are

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:24,120
should they be know right and so what

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,920
happens is well sometimes these headings

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,020
make text bigger that's not their point

00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,530
the point is structured like it was said

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,380
over there

00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:33,060
so you know chapter like the title of

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,340
the book that's your head level one

00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,260
heading all of your chapters those are

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,060
your level two headings your h2s

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,160
all those subsections those are your H

00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,410
threes right so the navigation for the

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,600
website could be the h2 all of the sub

00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,010
Navs can be your h3 right you have a

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,320
list view of a fleet of servers that

00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:51,240
you're managing servers is there h2 all

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,040
of the individual servers could be h3 if

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,300
you do that kind of semantic structure

00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,640
we're literally talking about nine

00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,620
characters of code here right less h3

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,930
greater less slash h3 greater right at

00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,120
its most basic form if you can do that

00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,590
then you can allow someone to use like a

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,610
screen reader to do stuff like this I

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,610
can navigate the structurally

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,540
[Music]

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,940
right so all I'm doing is navigating by

00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,550
heading I'm able to jump over tons of

00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:29,800
content just with one key right I can go

00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:31,180
backwards I can navigate by level those

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,860
were these threes let's see if there's

00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,540
any chore around here no more

00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,010
right through there wasn't one at a four

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,410
so you can explore the structure and

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,660
imagine if this was a 500 page document

00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:42,040
I could fly a process if that little

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,450
piece of code is missing

00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,460
it might look okay it might be in a

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,810
bigger font it might be bolded right it

00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,760
looks like a heading but it's not

00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:54,430
actually a heading now we're stuck

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:56,650
arrowing get to the next section right

00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,970
which is really arduous and incredibly

00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,100
frustrating does that make sense

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:04,180
so headings are important right simple

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:08,080
thing all right let's keep going sorry

00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:10,480
well Stadio restoring here we go so

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,570
we'll come back to that let's do yeah

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,650
here's here's a simple Google search I

00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,530
just did something simple melting an

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,300
NTFS and millions right okay so maybe I

00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,800
jump to the mean we'd written with one

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,080
keystroke I didn't have to read all that

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,760
stuff about Gmail and the google search

00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,860
and do I feel lucky or anything right I

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,780
just jump to the main section how did I

00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,450
do that because there's a main tag that

00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,980
they're using here main slash main and I

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,410
was able with one keystroke as my

00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,480
superior gives me that to jump into it

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:38,860
for for the geeks in the room how many

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,680
people here are familiar with VI the

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,960
text editor okay so you know how there's

00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,750
an insert mode and a browse mode in VI I

00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,940
have that on the web that is how I use

00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,050
documents so when I'm in insert mode

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,180
it's just like you're using the computer

00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,190
I can type it type my username I can

00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,050
tighten the types my password but if you

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,090
think about it it would be really nice

00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:00,250
to jump into that username field to

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,770
navigate by heading to navigate by link

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,200
to navigate by button or whatever that's

00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,990
where I can put it in browse mode and

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,540
then every single T on my keyboard has a

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,100
purpose B is but we see as combo boxes D

00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,870
is different element that I'm on right

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,040
now q is the main section

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,280
they were running out of letters at that

00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,050
point T is table navigation G is graphic

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,360
right I have all of these keys on my

00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:24,160
keyboard to fly across a webpage as long

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,870
as the semantics are there and it's

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,360
exactly like the eyes insert versus

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,059
browse mode does that make sense okay

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,190
cool so let's instead of going to sleep

00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:34,540
sorry about that

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:49,450
it must really suck not to be able to

00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:51,220
see the screen example here somebody put

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,690
that in an aria live vision and so I get

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,510
to hear the cookie warning every time I

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,100
load the page which is fantastic so

00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:58,420
little little niceties of the web so I

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,400
what I wanted to highlight here was

00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:05,650
there are some headings on this on this

00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:08,679
page so I can do this cool and then I

00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,059
can jump to the next heading which is

00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,860
awesome so I know there's two answers

00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,330
but here's the deal I don't I can't

00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:17,500
navigate between the answers so if I hit

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:19,270
H again it jumps to that area so we jump

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,220
over all of the answers so to me these

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,140
answers and sometimes this is a simple

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,030
one imagine you guys seen these threads

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,410
when there's like 30 nested comments and

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,410
all right so your arrowing down

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,279
[Music]

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,080
[Music]

00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,520
then you find the next one and then you

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,620
don't know if it's nested because it's

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,540
not a ul that would have been trivial to

00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,090
set up here so a little bit of HTML

00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,850
would have gone a super long way does

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,110
this make sense okay it's like like I

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,460
can read this at a thousand words a

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,190
minute that's not the hard part that

00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,750
problems been solved the problem is it's

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,780
that little bit of semantics is not

00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,760
there I'm spending way more time than

00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,940
you browsing the page okay

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,410
let's quickly go to another example

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,520
here's just the github page I don't want

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,740
to pick on github too much especially

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,240
since in all seriousness guys they're

00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,280
working on making this more accessible

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,380
they've been pushing code actually on it

00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,360
like a bi-weekly basis and we're working

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,100
with them as a client also to like make

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,200
it help more accessible so they're like

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,280
I want to give them props seriously but

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,150
I'm gonna pick on them a little bit and

00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,550
this is something they're already

00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,170
working on we chased that here's an

00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,700
issue this is the project I helped write

00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,770
it's called coyote it's an open source

00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,210
platform for authoring visual

00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,460
descriptions especially in the art world

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,260
so we have thousands of visual

00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,050
descriptions of paintings and artworks

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,220
and it's got Dublin core schemas and all

00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,480
that stuff happy to geek out with you

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,710
here if you're interested in this kind

00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,210
of thing but if we jump by heading here

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:52,030
okay cool so we know like where we are

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,679
but we can't navigate by issue right now

00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,240
it used to be the duty to have a

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,100
checkbox and I would use that as my

00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,660
trick and I would navigate my checkbox

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,460
but if you're not logged in the check

00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,320
boxes don't populate and so therefore

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,660
because this isn't using proper table

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,250
semantics our grid with markup I'm not

00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,640
able to navigate my issue so I have to

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,640
arrow down

00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:22,880
[Music]

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:25,130
found right and that's browsing github

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,020
issues okay it doesn't matter if you're

00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,270
a genius it really it does not matter if

00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,340
you know the answer for what the nginx

00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,050
comp needs to be right

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,030
the one-liner that needs to fix the

00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,790
problem right that's not the point the

00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:40,160
point is that if it's making you 15 20

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,320
30 extra seconds of her little micro

00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,660
tasks like simply finding the issue

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,100
that's where it becomes really

00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,660
exclusionary somebody could be

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,700
absolutely brilliant let's say blind

00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,860
screenreader user but not be able to get

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,970
a job being productive in this space not

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,230
because they don't have the knowledge or

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,270
because they don't they can't do the

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,400
hacking that's frankly the easy part

00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,680
it's the just using the little dashboard

00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,060
or using a little web interface to get

00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,990
some of the project management stuff

00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,910
done does that make sense

00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:11,780
all right let's look at one other thing

00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:14,690
really so here's the setting up a land

00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,850
on EWS something that should be

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,530
relatively easy to start off with I just

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,110
wanted to start with like let's just

00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,910
jump to the main section okay so it has

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:25,840
that that's good by the way not all of

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:30,070
the pages have this I found one that did

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,070
okay okay

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:38,210
we're looking short not really very

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,210
clear but fine we'll go with that

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,390
okay so we jumped from a level one

00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,920
heading to a level five heading so it's

00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,620
not a logical heading structure right

00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:52,350
let's just keep going

00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,970
sure okay oh there's radio buttons well

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:57,480
I know how to navigate by radio button

00:32:53,970 --> 00:33:01,200
so let me navigate by radio buttons well

00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,760
okay but it didn't give me a label no

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,040
idea what I'm checking now I can down

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,360
arrow

00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,550
okay sure and then I have to go back up

00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,610
and maybe check it out all right let's

00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:19,640
just keep going

00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:19,640
okay okay

00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:28,680
what if I want to do stuff with like

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:30,540
speech and then do I DD / tagging but

00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:36,450
cool I don't know what that does let's

00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:38,340
just keep up I'm able to 0 but obviously

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,960
it seems like a pagination control but

00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,280
you know not really knowing what we're

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,280
adding let's just skip this whole

00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,099
[Music]

00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:51,970
and so on and so forth right and then if

00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,980
we want to navigate by these radio

00:33:51,970 --> 00:34:00,190
buttons presumably to find some some

00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:01,779
blueprints that we can use you see no

00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,730
labels right now I can do some advanced

00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:07,720
stuff I know how to use table navigation

00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,470
keys so I can navigate by table so I

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,510
can't do that either

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:12,010
all right so basically you need your

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,240
arrowing down your airing down you're

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:17,169
reading all the stuff you're trying to

00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,879
intuit what is there it's not like the

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:20,260
knowledge might be there but if the

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,540
interface does not have these

00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,429
appropriate semantics this is just a few

00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,690
characters of code effects so rate your

00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,129
button that's missing a label it's

00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,599
missing an aria-label by on an ID

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,510
attribute right this is a few minutes

00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,210
defense but these kinds of things make

00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:37,089
really profound have really profound

00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:39,099
significant impact in terms of what

00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:40,750
people aren't able and not able to do

00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,560
independent of what they know does that

00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,210
make sense

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,560
all right give me one second I'm going

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,560
to switch back to the to the slides

00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:05,820
you'll prevent me I am not used to a

00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:05,820
talking the slow sorry that was painful

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:20,680
much there's this and then what you do

00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:23,020
this and it'll take 20 seconds still

00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,820
being jitter here because screen readers

00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,190
do not like when you play with their

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,420
video input cell just give me one second

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,790
and it will stabilize and I'll be able

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,790
to draft this line together there we go

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,650
and then if you guys give me a visual

00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:40,090
Chuck when they are on the screen there

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,170
I'm cool cool beans

00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,170
give me one second to dismissed

00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:56,439
okay are using perfect okay I'll just

00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:58,179
advance quickly here it lost my stateful

00:35:56,439 --> 00:36:03,209
position but that's okay

00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:03,209
I mean PowerPoint doesn't have any bugs

00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:19,689
almost there okay thank you for humoring

00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:22,869
that okay so we did the demo and so now

00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:24,729
some concluding basically thoughts right

00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:26,140
so just to sum up a little bit about

00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:28,299
what we've what we've been talking about

00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,400
so there's tons of benefits to this

00:36:28,299 --> 00:36:31,869
stuff right when we you know when we

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,369
think about making our stuff more

00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:36,069
inclusive more accessible

00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:37,599
it really has a profound impact it

00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,069
changes the way we think about the user

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,229
experience I cannot tell you the number

00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:42,939
of times we've done something you know

00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:45,069
presumably for one group of users like

00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:46,599
keyboard navigation or whatnot somebody

00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,400
else comes along says I use that feature

00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,079
all the time I can see perfectly fine I

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,429
use that feature all the time people on

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,749
the autism spectrum use audio

00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:54,759
description even though that's for

00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:57,279
someone who is blind I think many of us

00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:59,229
have used captions in a bar or loud

00:36:57,279 --> 00:37:00,249
environment even though originally

00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:02,769
that's for deaf and hard-of-hearing

00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:05,349
audiences so this stuff has emergent

00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:06,969
benefits if we take the time to do it

00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:08,619
right there's regulations that force us

00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:11,890
to do it as well right it's the right

00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:14,169
thing to do and there are a lot of

00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,849
benefits of doing it upfront trust me

00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:17,469
just real talk I invoice people both

00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:19,029
ways it's cheaper when you do it at the

00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:23,219
beginning right that's just that's

00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:26,049
that's reality right so having said that

00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:27,489
kind of closing thoughts decisions

00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:30,219
matter so I wanted to leave us with this

00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:32,259
and hopefully have a few minutes for Q&A

00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:34,269
you know when Maya Angelou's quote is

00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:36,069
when people will forget what you said

00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:37,419
people will forget what you did but

00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:39,939
people will never forget how you made

00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:41,259
them feel and when we make interfaces

00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:42,429
when we make even little like throwaway

00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,109
scripts that we don't think about

00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,359
generates a little dashboard or

00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:48,519
something that that does have an impact

00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:51,050
on people we might not know it right now

00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:52,790
it might impact us 5-10 years now

00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,650
the road right designing for your future

00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,750
self is another concept that comes out

00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,580
of this work so just thinking about how

00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,340
the things that we are creating make

00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,660
make others feel is at the heart of the

00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,240
work and you know what I try to get

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,740
people to think about and you know with

00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,450
that I want to just thank you guys for

00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,460
for listening and for you know just

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,870
thinking about this stuff with me it

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,360
really matters like picking off the

00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,010
speaker / consultant how I benefit when

00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,320
you use proper markup when you use

00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:19,910
proper HTML when you think about

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,620
accessibility so I want to thank you for

00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:25,000
that and if we have time for questions

00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm happy to take anything you got

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,160
definitely so what are some important

00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:35,900
resources online web aim w/e Baim or has

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,010
some good resources on for example like

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,360
if you're interested how do I make my

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,920
PowerPoint accessible how do I make what

00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,900
Word document accessible what are like

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,540
the top five things like headings color

00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,190
contrast that sort of thing there's a

00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,140
list of resources we always send to

00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,400
clients I am happy to email that list to

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,460
Pete if you don't mind distributing it

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,420
to the to everybody here as a link blast

00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,160
that would be awesome

00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,200
so I'll link to on like the wicked

00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,940
guidelines REO which is the accessible

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,790
rich internet applications it's part of

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:04,910
html5 of course now it has a couple of

00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,800
color contrast extension in chrome so

00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,990
you can just click it right there see

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,430
the color contrast issues on any page

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:16,520
you're on the HTML validator at w3c is

00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:19,100
fantastic just use that validator w3.org

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,360
/nu that is a fantastic validator

00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,830
because it warns you about accessibility

00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,080
issues as well does we capture

00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:26,600
everything but it at least is is that

00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,670
low-hanging fruit that you're talking

00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,110
about and I'll again I'll send out some

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:35,710
other links with them you know resources

00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:35,710
on like videos and thank you

00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,050
[Music]

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:48,860
yeah so I was a very impatient child and

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,260
so I kept hitting the faster button and

00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,120
then there was this other blind kid in

00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:56,510
school and he could listen faster than I

00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,910
could and that wasn't cool so that like

00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,520
a few days later I was like great I'm

00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,780
just cranking this and so I just I just

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,980
literally just kept doing that I mean I

00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,450
kept you know I had books on taping

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,820
stuff as a kid I had speed control on it

00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,770
so I kept hitting faster and faster I

00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,510
have an ongoing bet I've never lost with

00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,100
all of my friends which is that drinks

00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,350
are on me if I cannot get you to read

00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:18,320
faster with your ears then with your

00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:21,980
eyes and and it's it's you know proven

00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:24,140
to be I've always want because like most

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,820
people we we can listen pretty quickly I

00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,380
can get most people to 2x with no

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,200
problem at all and if you think about it

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,880
2x is already 300 or 350 words per

00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,710
minute that's basically the reading

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,810
level we expect of a college graduate in

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,180
this country 2.5 x here at 4 to 500

00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:40,580
words per minute it's not that hard to

00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,680
get at a pretty high comprehension rate

00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,030
and high speed rate and you can do it

00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,600
with just like things like podcasts just

00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:49,850
up it a little bit 1.25 1.5 if the guys

00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,560
go no overpass on iOS it's a great app

00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:53,450
like it just it has really good speed

00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,190
controls and I just hope people take

00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:58,100
your favorite podcast don't slow down

00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,470
like be ok with the discomfort a little

00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,990
bit and keep speeding it up you will get

00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,490
used to it I promise and that's that's

00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,890
kind of the trick for for how to do it

00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:08,630
be aware there's a reason I use this

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,420
robotic sounding voice like it felt like

00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,470
it came out of 1985 right and frankly

00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,560
kind of did um

00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:18,020
because this thing is math this is just

00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,940
C code that is generating phonemes the

00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,980
formant synthesized it what that means

00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,450
is I can crank it it can talk faster

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,460
than I can understand I'm not going to

00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,800
be the limiting I mean it's not going to

00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,920
be the limiting factor with human speech

00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,950
you reach some limits after about 2.5 to

00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,120
3x human speech does not maintain its

00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,490
comprehensibility

00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,140
so be aware of that if you want to crank

00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,350
it faster than that then you start going

00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,350
to

00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:54,910
107 yes so there's automated testing but

00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:56,349
just keep in mind and this is just again

00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,759
real talk because there's companies that

00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:00,190
will sell you automated testing tools

00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,390
for accessibility anything that is good

00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,670
and they'll tell you the good ones will

00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:06,880
tell you automated testing captures

00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,349
about 20 to 25 percent of issues that is

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,989
if it's operating at its best

00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:12,640
okay 20 that's a fact of computer

00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:14,410
science when we start getting strong AI

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,640
we throw some really significant machine

00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,949
learning at it we can get a little

00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,180
higher but 20 to 25 percent is what

00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:21,279
automated testing gets you but that's

00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,289
still along that's a lot and it gets you

00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:26,559
a good 20 to 25 percent the important

00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:28,479
stuff so they are in Chrome it's built

00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,920
into that audit tab so you can go in

00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,019
click on accessibility right there in

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,019
dev tools and run the the lighthouse

00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:37,359
tools run the accessibility checker in

00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:39,190
there Firefox you know how there's a web

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,859
inspector like you can inspect elements

00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:44,079
there's an accessibility inspector built

00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:46,719
into Firefox what's cool about that is

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,910
if you inspect an element it will tell

00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:51,309
you the computed accessible name in

00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,739
other words it will tell you how your

00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:55,420
SVG button that's all fancy that's got

00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:57,819
that animation hanging off of it as well

00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,049
will read to a screen reader you can do

00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:01,089
all that stuff just make sure the label

00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:03,160
exists and it will tell you that

00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:05,140
computed accessible name so those are

00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,119
two things and then again running it

00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,849
through a validator validated a markup

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,650
is the number one thing it's so easy to

00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:13,390
do you can put it in a grunt task and

00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,579
Travis in whatever and it's the easiest

00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,319
thing to ensure everybody just writes a

00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:19,150
valid markup I know it's an easy thing

00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:21,519
to say I cannot tell you how much

00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:23,289
invalid markup I come across on a daily

00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,539
basis and that has profound implications

00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:27,249
for accessibility because it means that

00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:29,499
the browser is not operating off of a

00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:31,799
well-formed Dom is that into your

00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:31,799
question

00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,120
thank you so much

00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:43,050
[Applause]

00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:51,270
