hi everyone in this video I'm going to

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,790
talk about how we can deploy spinnaker

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,870
onto kubernetes and then access it via

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,660
ingress now spinnaker is a multi cloud

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,760
deployment platform developed by Netflix

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,520
so it is designed to work with

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,289
kubernetes Google Cloud Oracle cloud and

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,300
AW this now let's see how we can deploy

00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:29,189
spinnaker so in order to deploy

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,399
spinnaker we have to interest all to

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:38,040
call halia so holid is basically a tool

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,370
to come online to do manage spinnaker

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:49,170
lifecycle first we have download the

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:51,360
install halyard Sh by then we have to

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,360
execute that install usage this will

00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:05,880
download the Hal Arden's install it in

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:09,090
our machine after we install halyard we

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,210
have to configure our cloud provided so

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,090
our cloud products basically the cloud

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,670
platform we are we going to deploy our

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,040
application so in this case I am going

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,900
to diplomat occasion to do the

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,439
kubernetes cluster so I'm going to

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,130
configure my cloud communities as my

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,130
cloud Friday

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:54,590
so this will take some time so next we

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,950
are going to add an account so you know

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,470
to do that we need kubernetes concurrent

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:04,430
context and then account name

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:09,100
so first we'll extract kubernetes

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:16,310
current context into a variable then

00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:23,390
we'll be fine account account name then

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:40,430
we'll configure a lot with the account

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:42,800
name and context then we are choose

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,170
environment to deploy spinnaker now we

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,120
have two option one is locally

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,850
installation using Debian packages

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,580
another one is distributed installation

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,580
on kubernetes now it is highly

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,040
recommended to use a distributed

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,950
installation on kubernetes so let's

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:05,150
configure how they are to deploy

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:09,430
spinnaker and to kubernetes so in do

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,320
that we have to execute its come on

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,720
so this will configure disability

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,660
installation now we are going to

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,050
configure kubernetes liveness probe and

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,060
linus probe initial delay second so the

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,270
value for liveness from initial delays

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,620
second should be the longest service

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:39,680
startup time so I'm going to put 600

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:42,739
second thing

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,780
are going to choose a storage service

00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:50,569
for ready for spinnaker for this demo

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,549
I'm going to use readies but it is not

00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,549
recommended in production environment

00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:05,599
then we have to do two important things

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:09,019
first we have to configure spinnaker we

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,049
have to override display UI base URL so

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:16,849
I'm going to use negative / - UI base

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:18,979
URL then we have to configure spinnaker

00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:23,240
a or we have to override display API

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:32,720
base URL so I'm going to use spinnaker -

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:34,849
API dad / - snake API you are ready to

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,250
configure spinnaker version so we can

00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:47,930
get the available version from executing

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:54,550
this comma so I'm going to use vinegar

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,550
one one point sixteen point six

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:14,260
then we are going to deploy spinnaker

00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:16,840
use excusing this command now this will

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:26,050
take some time so it will download all

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:28,690
the images and then deploy now if you

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,330
get a rail like this

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,550
excuse same command again it will solve

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,200
this issue now this is actually bug in

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,200
the solid

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,860
now we are successfully deployed spinner

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:16,130
going into the complaint is environment

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,800
so now we are going to apply this rule

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,270
to access the spinnaker so I have

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,640
already created in this role for

00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:30,730
spinnaker you why so this is that

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:35,270
English row and so I created one for

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:40,600
eighth year so this is so now we are

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,600
going to apply this in this role

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:15,510
now we can access this mega using spirit

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:17,860
prod as you can see spring is load now

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,310
so we can see all the deployed

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:24,610
application so this is how we access

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:27,010
spinnaker using in this role so in my

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,070
next video I will discuss how we can

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,930
enable its pinnacle authentication with

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,930
