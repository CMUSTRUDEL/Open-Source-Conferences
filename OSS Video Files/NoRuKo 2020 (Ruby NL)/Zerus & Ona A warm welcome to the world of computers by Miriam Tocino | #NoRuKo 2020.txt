today

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,240
my name is miriam tosino and i am a

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,240
software developer a programming teacher

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,240
and author of perus and hona

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,119
it is a book series that teaches young

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,600
children about the digital world

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,280
to get them excited about technology

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,479
without the need for a screen and

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
through the power of books

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
the inspiration for this book series

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,680
came three years ago

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,119
when i had my son and i started thinking

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,280
about the way in which i'd like to

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,280
introduce him to the world of computers

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,000
one day sitting in the living room very

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,680
late at night because our baby didn't

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,320
sleep much

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
my husband and i he works also in the

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,920
tech industry

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,680
started saying wouldn't it be cool if

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,720
we're writing stories happening inside a

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
computer

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,439
about how computers do math or graphics

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,360
or how the internet works and

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,880
what if they were told by a zero on a

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,000
one

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,040
these are owners and they live inside

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,759
your computer

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,879
together with millions of others heroes

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,480
and ones

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,480
it is the binary world

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,440
now i'm gonna take it all the way back

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,120
when i was a young kid

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,440
because actually i haven't always been

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,800
this

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,640
passionate about computers in fact

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
my dad always wanted me to go into

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,160
computer science

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
but as a child i thought computers were

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,519
so gray and so

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,519
boring and i wanted to do something

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,440
creative and something colorful

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,640
and something that helped other people

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,680
around

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,400
so instead i went to college and studied

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,400
architecture

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,879
i worked as an architect for several

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,000
years in different countries around

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,800
europe and it wasn't until i met my

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,440
husband

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
so my boyfriend at the time that things

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,879
started to shift for me

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,800
he is a game programmer and he loves

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,840
his work so very soon we started having

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
conversations

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,680
about programming and coding and very

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
geeky stuff

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,959
and i especially remember one time that

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,200
we were

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,800
i think it was also very late at night

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,640
talking about the difference between

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,640
inheritance and composition

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,040
and i remember myself yes loving all

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,239
those design patterns conversations

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,080
so i started seeing how awesome

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
this thing of being a programmer

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,319
actually could be

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,319
potentially

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,720
it was during the summer of 2013 after

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
some

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,840
time living together that i finally

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,159
decided

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
to quit my job as an architect and i

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,840
stayed at home

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,799
for six months teaching myself how to

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,080
code

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,120
through online courses and

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,760
yes i've tried them all

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
i soon became a software developer and

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,280
later on

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,159
a programming teacher where i showed

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
other people

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,840
how to switch careers too

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,720
it took me 29 years to find the creative

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,079
the colorful and the human side of

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,040
technology

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,320
and i don't want the same thing to

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
happen to today's

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,880
children

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,919
this is what happened some weeks ago

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
i attended a conference in the uk the

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,360
weir tech

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,919
women conference and in one of the chat

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
rooms

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,360
this dad reached out to me

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,880
i have a six-year-old girl who i love to

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,440
get more into stem

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,479
which stands for science technology

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,520
engineering and math

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,960
and he said she already sees technology

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,680
as a boy thing

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,479
regardless of how much i've tried any

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,880
ideas on how i can encourage hair into

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,160
stem

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
the first thing that happened was i time

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,479
traveled

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,479
like 30 years back when i was there with

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,479
my dad right and he was not able to

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,039
reach me and

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,080
during my research for paris and ona and

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,039
after speaking

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,840
with many parents and teachers i can

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,080
tell you

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,880
he is not the only one having this

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,960
situation

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,320
at home it seems that still

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,360
many girls see computers the way i did

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
as if they weren't for them and with

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
pedes and ona

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,800
i want to intervene and save those girls

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,560
they are a tool that my dad didn't have

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
years back when i was a child

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,680
this girl here she's four and during one

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,919
of our last events

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,960
i started reading together i started

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,199
reading with her

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,960
players gets a virus which is the first

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,960
book in the series

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,360
and suddenly she went on alone

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,680
and she started telling me all she knew

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,759
about trojans worms and boats

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,759
and how they might have infected terrors

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,160
and all the things they were trying to

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,080
do

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,919
they were trying they were doing trying

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,120
to cure him

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,560
and i was so surprised and then talking

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
with her parents

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
it turns out that she likes to read the

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,039
book several times

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,039
in the week

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,440
but my books aren't just for girls

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,160
it is important that we reach out to

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,440
boys

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,720
too that's why i chose

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,600
two characters for my series a zero and

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
a one

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,600
a boy and a girl to reflect

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,199
an equal relationship between them to

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,639
model collaboration

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,400
and how to deal with computers together

00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:02,479
for both girls and boys to identify with

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,400
the characters

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,039
there is a big reason why i use

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,080
illustration and storytelling to teach

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,479
kids about computers these

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,960
are two of the things that i loved the

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,440
most when i was little

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,280
and when learning something new the

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,000
vehicle of communication

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,000
becomes as important as the topic that

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,039
we are trying to teach

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,919
it enables us to reach our kids

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,639
the medium we use becomes an opportunity

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,639
for connection

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,080
here we can take the new book welcome to

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
our world

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,960
as an example it is a short

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,360
story written in the form of a poem

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,240
it tells the story of how status and

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,000
owner first

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,000
met inside the computer

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,000
i'm working on the last pieces with a

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,479
musician to turn it into a song too

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
and we are using some golden for some of

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,080
the sounds

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,080
really cool

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,840
here's how the whole process would look

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,360
like

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
you could have started reading the book

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,240
with the kids you talk about serious and

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,120
ones and indeed some invites and they

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
get to know

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,960
there's an owner later on they hear

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,360
about the song

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,240
they learn it by heart they sing it and

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,879
dance to it

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,879
for a full week

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,080
once they're singing the song you could

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,800
say

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,839
oh did you know they use code to play

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,479
the music

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
let's see how they do that and then you

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,240
hop onto your computer

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
you show them some code pieces running

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
and making sounds

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,640
and at this moment they are already

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,560
curious about it

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,080
and when it's time to learn some coding

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,080
your kids are already into it

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
not every child needs to become a

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
programmer

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,240
but they need to know that understanding

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,560
computers

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,240
and how they work will give them

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,480
superpowers

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,600
it will become an important part of

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,000
their toolkit

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
to express themselves and create their

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,399
own world

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,399
in whatever way they choose

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,240
and here i want to tell you my personal

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,800
experience

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
you could say that terrors and ona bring

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,480
together

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,480
what i've been learning during the past

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,120
20 years of my life

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,200
the architecture the programming and the

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,000
teaching

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,080
and i love that but here's the thing if

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,959
you'd guessed to ask me

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,320
which of these three things gave me the

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,320
biggest confidence

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,680
to move forward with the project 100

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,320
it was my ability to code

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,279
knowing that i was going to be able to

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,680
build my own quest

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,000
with my own website setting up the shop

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
the domain hosting the email hosting

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,079
customizing liquid templates gathering

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
all those data from those products and

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,600
putting it where i wanted

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,959
and everything that's to come in the

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,360
future

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,800
knowing that i could take care of all of

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,920
that by myself

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,839
it was such a boost i bet you know what

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,279
i'm talking about

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,040
and i think in this case it gave me the

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,680
mind space that i needed

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,240
to be able to focus on the drawing the

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,160
color

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,360
and the stories that's why i believe

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,880
that it is important now more than ever

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,440
that we come up with fresh exciting

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,519
and innovative ways to introduce the

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,800
world of computers to our kids

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,200
to reach as many of them as we can

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,480
and for that we need to make computers

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,480
more approachable

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
friendly and easy to understand

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,760
this picture here it's a whiteboard from

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,640
one of my classes

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,320
this is how my students learned about

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,120
rails

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,000
from my days as a teacher i learned the

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
importance of

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
stories especially when we are learning

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,800
something new and that's why during my

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,680
classes

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,079
we talked about code as much as we coded

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,200
if you talk with some of my students

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,600
they can tell you

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,640
how i often there i very often say

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,279
close your laptops it's time to talk

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,000
and i saw again and again how they

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,040
normally

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,480
felt more confident after they heard

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,680
my stories about stressful apis models

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,720
views and controllers

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,160
and so with perus anona i thought about

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,399
how i could bring some of those elements

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,839
that i learned in my teaching into

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,000
people's homes

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
and help parents open up the

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
conversation

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
around tech

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,959
and for that next to the book series i

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,079
created

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,040
the abc of computers it is free

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,519
newsletter

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,560
to help you create your own collection

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,160
of computers

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,160
stories to tell at home

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,200
all the episodes are also on the website

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,839
and you can check them out

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,839
at terrorismona.com abc

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,079
all the episodes follow a similar

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,639
instruction

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,800
first we start with something that's

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,720
already familiar for the children

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
something from the world something that

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,440
they can relate to

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
in the example of what is the ram you

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,880
could ask them to

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,560
imagine how would it look like to live

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,519
without memory

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
how awful would that be right and then

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,040
you'd say

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,200
okay so computers are just the same they

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,440
need a way to remember information

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,440
and the rom helps them to do that

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,040
then you're ready to dive deeper with

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,480
them

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,800
and learn something new in this example

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
they learned how the ram stores beats

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,920
and bikes

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,600
and they'll hear for the first time

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,600
about megas and gigas

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,040
after that there's always some computer

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,440
science history

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,839
i like to showcase the people and the

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,720
ideas behind computer science

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,440
so we make computers more human and

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,440
unrelatable

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,680
last is exploration time

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,320
i always include unblocked activities to

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,440
take

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,199
all those learnings off the screen

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,040
sometimes there are illustrations to

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,360
color like this one the cpu map

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,279
or crosswords like this one the

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,079
crosswords of there's getsavarus the

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,240
first book

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,040
to see again some of the words that they

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,040
learned with the book

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,839
and of course i needed to have cutouts

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,360
because if you've ever had a

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
three-year-old in the house

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,440
you already know that their their life

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,120
is way more fun

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,360
if they have a pair of scissors in their

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
hands

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,320
this is what happens when you give those

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,959
to them

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,680
i also ask them normally to create their

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,680
own stories

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,760
and this boy here he says he's writing

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,760
the book number two of arizona

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,880
the best feedback though came in last

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,279
week

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,360
out of the blue i got this email from a

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,000
nine-year-old girl in the uk

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,720
hi i love all your stuff harrison owner

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
so cute

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
i've colored the cpu map and cut out my

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,079
series and on a beats

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,399
and i'm making them a cpu home to live

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,680
in my brother gets your emails and he

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,600
forwards them to me

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,279
bye i asked her if she could send over

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
some pictures because i couldn't

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,720
i don't i didn't want to miss that and

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,320
uh look at this

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,959
she'd color her cpu mom she'd make them

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
a lego home

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,199
and look what she did with those kettles

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,839
i think this is amazing and

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,399
especially when i think back that day

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,759
with our newborn in the living room and

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,800
i had my first thought

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,800
for ferros anona

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,959
perez are out on a mission to make

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,800
computer science accessible to every

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,639
child

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,920
if you want to join these are some of

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,920
the things that you can do

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,920
you can sign up for the abc of computers

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,160
newsletter

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,040
and start creating your own arsenal of

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,399
stories

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,399
to tell at home week by week

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
i prepare a pdf for you all to get you

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,240
started

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,240
and you can get it at status

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,240
petersonona.com

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,519
also you can already get there's a virus

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,399
the first book in the series

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,800
the paperback is already on amazon you

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,480
just need to search for perus and honor

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,440
and this book they normally ask what is

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,920
the age range

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
and i can tell you i have readers from

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,199
three years old

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,000
until uh 11 12 13

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,519
and onward because with the little ones

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,040
you can focus on the pictures and

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,560
the illustrations and the characters and

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
it comes with a parent guide and a

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,440
glossary that it turns out

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,800
it's also for the provider ages and i

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,759
have

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,000
readers written it by themselves it is

00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,160
already available in four languages

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,160
english dutch journal and spanish

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,640
and then the new book welcome to our

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,919
world

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,959
if you ask me i tell you

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,760
this is the book that i wish that i'd

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,839
love to see

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,720
in every preschool but

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,520
i can say that because i got so many

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,880
grown-ups

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,240
liking it already and here i want to

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,160
tell you a story that happened

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
in one of the last conference

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,280
conferences that i attended before we

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,080
were all locked down

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,760
and i was signed in books and then i

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,120
normally when i sign book

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,679
books i ask um what's the name of the

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,200
child

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,679
right then what's the name of the

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,840
channel and then i get this one person

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,520
and then i ask him what is the name of

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,919
the child and he looks at me

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,799
like he said like there's no child and

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,080
he said like

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,160
no like okay i'll send it for you yes

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,200

hope to see you soon in the binary world

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,120
and now i'd love to hear from you

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,720
because i think

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,679
we got some minutes left for q and a's

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,960
am i right all right that is exactly

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,400
right

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,080
yeah so we have a minute for q a um well

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,760
one of the first questions i'd like to

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,559
ask you is um

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,960
well i saw that the books are both books

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,120
available in in four languages

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,200
the first one is in four languages and

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,000
the second one for now it's only gonna

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
be available

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
in english because it is a song and it's

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,080
very short and i thought

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,840
actually it's nice that they get it you

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,720
know that everyone needs like a

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,840
universal

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,880
thing right kind of so for now

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
only in english

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,159
let me ask a question because you well

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,320
uh are obviously obviously very

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,679
uh proud of the book uh well of the

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,360
books and

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,039
especially now that you just got news

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,559
that's well what the what the preprint

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,480
will uh will look like

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,400
um did you think about open sourcing

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,200
translations or did you already do that

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,240
or did you try

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,039
the house yourself how did that work

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,400
for the first one i go translators

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,240
freelancers for

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,320
the different versions of the book and

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,240
it was a very nice experience because i

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,960
got to i got connected with a lot of

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,440
people

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,320
and i got a lot of better readers in the

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,320
different countries

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,240
okay i understand um do you consider

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,039
uh open sourcing translations i mean you

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,039
call it a

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,120
book series so potentially you're not

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,480
going to well end with number two but

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,919
continue which i hope would you

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,320
tell me what you mean so tell me what

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,360
you mean i know

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,000
oh i mean i if you want to read this to

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,600
your kids

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,360
it would make a lot of sense to have it

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,280
in well their mother tongue

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,880
and would you be open to open source

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,880
translations or

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,039
only that you know it's like it's one

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,080
step at a time

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,440
right like i i mentioned that conference

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,039
right like in february

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,000
right and then uh i think i got like 15

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,640
different languages in that queue

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,840
and i was like and everyone was like are

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,360
you gonna be there are you gonna be

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,000
doing danish you know like you're gonna

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,360
be doing

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,840
russian and uh so

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,120
that's why it must have been a

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,120
compliment during that question

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,559
well then say

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,600
the book well is being read by children

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,640
from three till 11.

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,200
now i know that you have a

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,679
three-year-old yourself that means that

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,919
the first book has been written while

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,120
you had a baby or potentially a taller

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,039
around how

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,159
how do you write a book with a toddler

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,120
around

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,600
that's a very good question it was a

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,490
very

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,280
chaotic process

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,720
[Applause]

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:46,159
to say that and i i now see

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,799
it was like like it came in phases

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,600
right because of course from the moment

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,640
that i had

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,480
that idea right in the beginning the

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,120
project was like a hobby

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,320
kind of thing right like and also in the

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,720
beginning

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,600
you know there was this idea in the back

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
back of my

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,799
back of my mind that was like medium

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,559
you're just

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,840
you're just drawing zeros and ones you

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,840
know what are you doing

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
you know and i was just spending i

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
actually spent a lot of time to find the

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,919
right anatomy of a zero

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,559
and the right anatomy of a one and be

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,240
happy with

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,720
it you know because i'm spending a lot

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,360
of time with them so that was first

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,360
so the first phase i think it was it

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,760
only started he was six months old

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,720
and i was at home with him and then i

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,440
would only

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,880
draw during nap times i was also so

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,960
sleep deprived you know

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,640
and then naps were very small and i

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,919
needed something to actually

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,640
you know get along with the days and i

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,880
started the

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,000
100-day project 100 days of terrorism

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,720
ona and

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,840
uh that's got got me going and then

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,000
after the 100 days

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,760
project i did 64 or so um

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,520
i was talking with with my husband with

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,559
jose and then we were saying

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,080
look i was telling him this is this is

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,360
getting serious you know i really want

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,039
to do this you know like

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,960
and i cannot do it during enough times

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,480
you know we need to find another way

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,039
and then that's the moment when we

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,120
decided okay

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,480
half of the week he's gonna go to work a

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,200
little bit later

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,600
i'm gonna wake up at 6 30 very early i'm

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,960
gonna

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,520
slowly close the door of the house

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,120
get out of the house go to a coffee

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,919
company there in amsterdam

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,400
next to his work and then i was working

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,600
there

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,480
for three hours in the morning and then

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,720
again

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,279
during the nap time in the afternoon so

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,600
it was this process of okay two hours

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,600
here

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,919
three hours there until finally the

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,039
first book got published

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,559
and now i have a little bit more time so

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,679
for the second one i've been a little

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,039
bit more flexible

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,760
and yeah especially the last months

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,400
it's been very you know i got some more

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,520
focus

00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,240
to work on it but yeah

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,240
complain to that

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
yeah it's not easy yeah it's been quite

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,240
a process i was saying

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,039
yeah yeah but well i have a kid that is

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
just a bit

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,880
uh older than than yours so i can relate

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
to the fact that you will get a bit more

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,400
time

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,200
also i don't think that i mean that you

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
write a book

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,240
doing this is very special but i don't

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,159
think it's very special that you have a

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,000
kit and you get around to drawing ones

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:29,200
and zeros and nothing more this

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,840
thing i can we'll heartily agree to that

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,760
um well i want to thank you very much

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,120
for your

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,159
enlightening us on well how this

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,679
trajectory has been for you um

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,840
thank you and also well that's

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,919
actually the last three years of you
