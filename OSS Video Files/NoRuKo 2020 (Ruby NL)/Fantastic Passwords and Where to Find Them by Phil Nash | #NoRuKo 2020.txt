Description: 
	The humble password is broken. The internet is littered with poor security practices and password breaches, but the world is not ready to go password free yet. So what can we do to protect our users? Let's take a look at how we currently protect passwords, at what we can throw away from those processes and what we can bring in to help strengthen our users' passwords. We'll investigate the tools, practices and APIs that can help us in this endeavour. Together we can move the world from *password1* to *correct horse battery staple* and beyond! 

Phil is a developer evangelist for Twilio and a Google Developer Expert. He's been in the web industry for 10 years building with JavaScript and Ruby. He can be found hanging out at meetups and conferences, playing with new technologies and APIs or writing open source code online. Sometimes he makes his own beer, but he's more likely to be found discovering new ones around the world.

Welcome to the #NoRuKo conference. A virtual unconference organized by Stichting Ruby NL.

um as far as i know

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:11,679
um we have uh phil in our

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,679
in our stream set up phil is a developer

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,680
phil is a developer and an evangelist

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,439
for twilio

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,160
and google developer expert so he's been

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,359
well a web uh development professional

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
for some 10 years

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,840
building with both javascript and

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,200
clearly

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,360
ruby he's a frequenter of meetups

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,640
of conferences he plays with a lot of

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,760
new technologies

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,440
and apis and writing some some source

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,399
code online

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,879
and sometimes he makes his own beer i

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,399
hope

because you're about to speak

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,960
but he's more likely to be discovering

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,879
beers somewhere around the planet

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,719

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,759
i'm a developer evangelist for company

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,560
called twilio i'm coming to you uh

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,960

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,439
so

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
uh it is already just uh just turned

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
over midnight it's the future it's uh

quite nice

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,759
i guess from where i am uh not allowed

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
outside the house right now because we

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,600
are uh we are currently in quite a

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,479
strict lockdown in melbourne so um

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,360
yeah it's good to be with you all of you

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,119
um

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,640
you can find me online at all these

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,000
places i'm basically filmmash everywhere

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,479
except for twitch which i'm

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,640
increasingly on at phil underscore nash

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,159
go find me there come hang out

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,240
if you want to now let's talk about

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,799
passwords i want to talk to you and tell

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,159
you

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,880
about my first uh password um

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
because it's kind of embarrassing uh

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,280
it's uh

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,280
it's it's embarrassing because well

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,440
it was my first password for a computer

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,000
login system at my school so i was young

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
i'm gonna

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,760
start with the caveats here uh i was i

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,520
was young and

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,080
foolish and did not know what i was

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,720
doing with any kind of security

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
um my first password was four characters

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
long it was all in lower case and it was

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,760
my last name

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,360
um which uh you know really should have

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,160
uh keyed me into it not being safe um

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
of course my friends uh eventually kind

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,280
of got

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,640
wind of this and hacked into my account

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
and uh

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,120
well they didn't really do much to it

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
because we were very young and there

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
wasn't much internet around at the time

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
and

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,000
and really it wasn't a problem but it

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,720
should have taught me a lesson

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,280
uh and it didn't really uh because you

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
know

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
my next password was still four

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
characters long still uh all lowercase

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,040
and

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,239
i was just a massive nerd at the time

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,280
and thought atom was cool as a password

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,879
not good times um but do you know what

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,879
um of course i got hacked uh and

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
and that happens to so many people these

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,360
days and this is kind of

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,159
what i want to cover and discuss today i

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
got hacked

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,440
um because uh passwords are terrible you

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,080
know

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,599
actually it wasn't my fault at all i was

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,799
a kid i didn't know what i was doing but

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,799
passwords in general

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,319
are terrible i think we can all pretty

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,280
much agree on that and if you don't

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,599
agree with me

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,680
i'm gonna tell you why first up

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,120
all we have with passwords is a bunch of

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
guidelines

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,599
um guidelines that are mostly wrong

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,400
mostly difficult to deal with

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,000
uh and then just yeah incorrect what are

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,519
those guidelines well i like these

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
ones uh you know your password must

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,799
contain at least eight cat letters a

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,760
capital a plot a protagonist with good

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080
character development

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
a twist and then a happy ending uh if

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,920
you did write a puzzle like that it

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,040
would be pretty secure i reckon

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,319
um and fun and probably somewhat

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
memorable

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,280
uh instead the guidelines we're given

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,680
are things like you must use an

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,720
uppercase letter and a lowercase letter

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,720
and a number and a special character and

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,120
ah then you can't remember what you've

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,280
written

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
and it's not even that much more secure

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
because what do we do with this

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,520
well those guidelines tell us that the

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,720
password password is not secure

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,040
and we know that that we know the

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,880
password password is not secure we know

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
the password nash is not secure as well

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,639
but i

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,479
didn't stop me setting it um but we know

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
the password password is not secure but

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,720
the password

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,080
password one yeah uh that is secure

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,280
right it's got everything it's got an

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,120
uppercase leather it's got all the

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,120
lowercase letters it's got

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
uh oh it's got a number it's got an

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,520
exclamation point that's a special

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,680
character

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,880
we're now in the secure realm of having

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,880
a password that no one will

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,040
ever be able to touch and hack right

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,479
i know you can't answer me or not along

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,840
because i can't see you but i'm i'm

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,520
assuming you're all nodding at your

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,800
screens right now being like yeah

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,080
this is super secure but

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
of course there are other guidelines

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,759
like we better change those passwords

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,840
regularly you know we don't want people

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
having them for too long because then

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,680
then they'll get broken then they'll get

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
hacked into um

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,000
yeah cool so we we have our super secure

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,759
password but at times come for us to

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759
change the password what do we do what

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,720
do we do we can maybe add a number to it

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
i guess

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,160
and this is still incredibly secure

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,600
uh and then the time rolls around again

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
and we do it again and it's all still

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
secure right it's fine we've got

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,759
password one two three

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,400
bang we're all good

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,400
super secure

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,320
i don't know i think that's that's

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,000
pretty guessable

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,400
probably you probably agree with me in

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,280
fact password is a fairly common word

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,880
uh defaulting to the number one would be

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,160
the probably the first thing you'd guess

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
if you were guessing anybody was adding

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,120
a number to a password and i think the

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,039
exclamation point

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
you know it is is right there on the one

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,560
key along with the shift

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,720
uh when you press shift as well so you

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,960
might you might guess at these

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,639
uh in fact like we've just created a

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,840
pattern for ourselves

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,840
um and and that's not a good thing

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,600
that's not a good thing for us it's a

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,400
great thing for people trying to hack

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,560
into or

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,440
or get into our account we've made a

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
pattern

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
uh because this this super secure

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,560
password here really just looks like

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,479
this

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,600
um so it's a dictionary word with an

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
uppercase letter

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
a number of lowercase letters a digit

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
which is probably one

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,479
and a special character which is

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
probably an exclamation point

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,199
so if you were writing some kind of

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
script to guess at people's passwords

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,400
you could use this pattern to absol to

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,639
cut

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,960
down that potential space of passwords

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
dictionary words uppercase letter a

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,800
bunch of lowercase letters

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,319
a number one or or any digit uh and then

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,840
and then a

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,120
and then an exclamation point and you

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,560
know if you don't get too many hits with

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,840
that you can start going through the

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,560
different special characters or the

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,560
different numbers

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,800
so that's not great and remember when

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,599
you are attacking

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,280
if you are an attacker trying to get

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,360
into somebody's account

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,319
it doesn't matter and i am watching the

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
the talk here

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,800
sorry the chat here as well you put the

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,479
number at the beginning nobody thinks of

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
that it doesn't matter if you get it

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,039
right

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,039
you as an individual because there's

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,160
somebody as a developer

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,039
we have users like in our

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
systems using these passwords we as

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,599
developers

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,319
are responsible for protecting

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,680
those people um and we are not

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,639
protecting them by giving them the

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,319
guidelines

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,319
that they need an uppercase letter

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,360
several lowercase letters a digit

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,360
and a special character

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,160
so um i've got an example of this

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,080
actually of how this actually manifests

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,520
itself in real life

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,919
i've got one from around this side of

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
the world you see a couple of years ago

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,319
um might have been three years ago

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,039
actually the western australian

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
government

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,039
did a security audit of the passwords

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,479
used in their systems

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,280
234 000 passwords are assessed and uh

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,120
what do we have

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,479
a quarter of them were deemed to be weak

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,960
passwords

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,240
which uh which is a shame and a good

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,879
1400 of them

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,879
uh where in fact the password

00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,879
password123

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,560
what i really like i've actually got the

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,840
top 20 uh here

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,039
and i think there must have been some

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,639
guidelines in here because you know

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,759
we're not seeing the password

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,280
oh no we are seeing the password

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,159
password it's right down there at number

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,120
nine

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,159
um yeah looking at 184 just straight

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,399
passwords

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
uh password123 that was pretty popular

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,680
but what i really like about this is

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,839
that there was clearly some guidelines

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,680
given to people not just like you must

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,560
use uppercase and lowercase letters

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,240
but some ideas of how to set a password

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
as you can see some patterns in here as

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
well

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
uh so we've got like date and time

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,880
patterns kind of october 2017

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,279
monday 01 spring 17 uh spring 2017

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,440
august 2017 so you can kind of tell when

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,480
the different cohorts of people started

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,920
working

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,640
um and that's uh that's horrifying uh if

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,200
you ask me

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,040
welcome one is great 132 people on their

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,880
first day at work set their password to

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,320
remind themselves to welcome themselves

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,600
in the morning

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,279
um uh and my favorite one actually my

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,080
favorite one on here is number 18.

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,959
98 of them available uh logitech one

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,200
because somebody

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,399
uh or 98 people were like i need a new

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
password and they looked down at their

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,720
desk and they saw their mouse or

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,800
something like that's it

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
logitech what it is i wonder how many

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,160
logitech twos there are in there

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,680
doesn't hit the top 20 but we'll get

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,040
there

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,279
um so this this

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,959
this sucks and we can see this in action

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,240
right here all of these are easily

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,360
guessable passwords

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,200
patterns that we can use to guess at

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,480
passwords

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
all right so once i moved on from

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
writing

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,560
really terrible passwords i actually

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,360
came up with a really good one i thought

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,360
for a while um it's my best password

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,399
right we're in we're in quotes here

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
i'm not actually going to tell you what

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,519
it is in case it does uh still

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,920
exist out there on a um

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,360
on an account somewhere uh i'm scared

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
and i don't want you to know it just in

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
case but i will tell you a few things

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,640
about it because i don't care that much

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,680
it was eight characters long um i was

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
pretty pleased about this eight

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,959
characters it's more it's twice the

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,160
twice the length of my name come on uh

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,959
they were all they were numbers and

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,120
letters

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,640
uh so that's pretty sweet and a mix of

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,880
them and they weren't just all at one

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,040
end or the other although uppercase

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,800
uppercase letters only i was very

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,959
uppercase on this one

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
and it was the model number of a piece

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,160
of hi-fi equipment

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,079
uh in my room which i find amusing

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,040
because uh if anybody was to come round

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,959
to my room

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,800
uh at the time uh there's just my

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,560
password like on display now it didn't

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,760
say password next to it it was just

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,200
there in my room read out um

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,640
it seemed pretty random at the time it

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
seemed pretty good and actually i don't

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,200
think anyone's ever

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,279
like guess it guessed it but

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,040
that didn't stop me getting hacked and

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,720
losing access to

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,640
uh a few accounts actually was i think i

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,760
lost in one day i lost access to my

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,720
spotify account

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,839
and my skype account and nearly my

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,440
dropbox account

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
but i had two-factor authentication set

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,079
up on that so i knew there was a hack

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,279
happening because uh

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,640
because i got a text message saying

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
you're trying to log into your dropbox

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,079
account

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,200
and i was like i'm not trying to oh that

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,040
doesn't sound good um

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,640
this uh i managed to recover both the

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,760
other accounts the spotify and the

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,440
skype account and um i wish i'd saved

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
this the history of what the people had

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,240
done with uh with my skype account

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,519
because

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,519
uh they had used it to

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,959
like propose marriage to a bunch of men

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,040
in french

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,480
which was odd because they hadn't

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
changed the name of the account it was

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,120
still

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,720
like phil nash and then there was a

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,079
bunch of french and i i got really

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
scared and deleted everything and i

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,440
haven't really been back in there

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,560
but i got hacked i got hacked with my

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,160
pretty secure password um but what

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,320
happened

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,440
it's because i was so pleased with said

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,720
secure password

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,040
that i used everywhere um

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
this is this is not smart it's not smart

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,399
right um

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,519
i used everywhere because i thought it

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,519
was secure

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,160
and therefore it was safe to use in all

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,600
of these places all of my accounts not a

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,120
good idea

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,200
not a good idea because even though i'd

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,880
managed to keep my password safe

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,480
that was not the case for people like

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,600
adobe or dropbox or bitly or last fm or

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,040
linkedin or discuss or tumblr all of

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,680
which my password has appeared in

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,680
breaches for

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
and they're just the big companies i can

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,680
name and from of

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,200
quite a while ago you know my passwords

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,240
haven't been dangerously in a breach

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,440
recently but there are breaches

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,480
of user data and plain text passwords

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,519
and poorly

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,200
hashed passwords every single

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
year every single month every single

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,639
week every single day there's another

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,600
breach of data

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,720
where some other site is handing out all

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,959
of our passwords

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,959
to the world that makes me sad

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,399
if you don't already know about it you

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,240
should

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,920
be checking the site have i been

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
pwned.com

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,120
this allows you to plug your email

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
address in and it will

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,200
email you every time one of your user

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,480
accounts and its credentials

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,480
appears in one of these breaches

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,040
yeah so that sucks um

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
and i do regularly i do still get emails

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,639
from the service

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,480
so that's not good either and right i

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,120
think we're just starting to uh

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,639
uh well no no one's suggested yet like

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
what about using a password service but

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,360
again

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
uh there's one of those things like the

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,680
way we solve this for ourselves

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,199
is to use like a password manager right

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,120
and a unique password per

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,680
site and i have three 400 500 accounts

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
or something

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,519
so i can never remember all of them must

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,199
use a new password pair

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,440
a password manager in order to deal with

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,440
this and again

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
it doesn't matter if i use a password

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,320
manager and you use a password manager

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,079
all of our users or 90 of our users have

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
never even heard of password managers

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,480
and are using the same password over and

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,800
over again so if somebody else

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
leaks their password into the world uh

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,680
they're still going to get attacked and

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,000
hacked into on our

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,519
sites sucks so how do we fix this

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,760
this is the most important part right

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,800
how do we as developers protect our

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
users

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,000
and make sure their accounts at least on

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,360
our sites

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,480
stay safe well

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,760
first up the guidelines were wrong those

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,120
horrific oh my goodness ah those

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399
guidelines back at the start there's

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,720
uppercase lowercase

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,240
number special character right those

00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,920
guidelines are actually written by a guy

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,760
in nist that's national institute for

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,720
science and technology in the us

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,279
and he's since apologized for that they

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
were

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,480
they were so wrong he's written an

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,000
apology and said

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,600
we should never have done this we

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,560
shouldn't be changing passwords

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,519
regularly we should not be making them

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,920
uh

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,720
easy to remember for computers um

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,839
hopefully

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,600
you've seen uh this uh xkcd comic it

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,720
really points out the problem right that

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,760
we have

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,160
encouraged people to come up with uh

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,279
these

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,639
sort of hard to remember easy for

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,079
computers

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,639
hard for people to remember uh problems

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,480
and the sqcd comic here suggests that

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,120
maybe just a pass phrase right

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,399
four separate words that have nothing to

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,199
do with each other

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,839
um it makes 44 bits of entropy it will

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,519
take 550 years to guess it

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,040
and who could forget correct horse

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,800
battery staple

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,440
right in fact you've already memorized

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,639
it um this is such a great point but we

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
can do better

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,839
than this well how do we how do we make

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,880
people

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,560
think more about past phrases than we do

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:12,399
about passwords

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:16,000
first up the uh the the security um

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,759
well so guidelines now from the acsc

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,320
that's the australian cyber security

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,880
center

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,000
uh that's here in australia the ncsc

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,959
that's the national

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,639
cyber security center in the uk and uh

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,079
nist the national institute for science

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,040
technology in the us

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,399
uh all agree on these guidelines uh the

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
passwords should be at least 13

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,720
characters long

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,880
13 characters easy um you should be able

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,440
to accept all characters

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,519
uh so stop regexing out things like

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,800
spaces or emojis why shouldn't people

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,199
have emojis in their

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,920
uh passwords and spaces particularly so

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,560
we can do

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,800
passphrases nicely and then don't allow

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,279
insecure passwords

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
that covers a few things uh so those

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,360
guidelines go a bit further into it

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,880
don't allow dictionary words um or not

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,639
like the password isn't just one

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,640
dictionary word a pass phrase of four

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,240
dictionary words is fine

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
uh don't allow repeated or sequential

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,439
characters do not allow context specific

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,520
words

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,880
uh so if you're logging in and you're

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,799
trying to use the same username

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,959
uh the same word for username and

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,240
password it's a bad idea or the email or

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,679
the application name that you're logging

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
into that kind of thing

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,000
and or passwords that have been in a

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,640
breach passwords that are

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,480
uh available online for other people to

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,720
read

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,000
so how we go about this in ruby because

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,000
i haven't actually spoken about the

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,440
language or our or our processes yet and

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,200
so i should get to this

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,120
so i had a little look around i had a

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,640
bit of a look at

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,480
kind of our authentication frameworks

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,640
and what we already provide

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,120
for um password validation

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,600
uh and there's not a lot kind of out the

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,840
box so if you use devise for example

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,080
um device will validate passwords and it

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,039
will make sure that they're between 628

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,679
characters

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,880
six is not enough but you know it does

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,320
this it doesn't actually put any of the

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,039
other guidelines in place on you

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,840
uh but it will do this um so for

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,080
orthlogic

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,080
took this validation out of an old

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,360
version and now just kind of recommends

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,120
it in their readme

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,200
but again this is like minimum eight

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,720
characters length password

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,280
uh and should be confirmed if it's

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,320
required eight characters is

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,360
better than devises minimum but still

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,360
not enough

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,039
and clearance doesn't even have an

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,360
opinion on this which is fine

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,640
uh it doesn't have to it's it's not

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,440
technically its job

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,679
uh and it isn't really for the others um

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,160
so

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,679
i have some suggestions uh first up if

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,320
you're in a rails app just validate that

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,160
the path is

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,440
like the password's like 14 characters

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,400
long why not

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,280
uh we can um humanize this by adding

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,880
into our ui

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,640
things like you know user passphrase or

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,240
suggested password manager but if we

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
just make the password at least 14

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,760
characters long

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,640
then it's least much less likely to be

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,480
repeated

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
an existing password that somebody else

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,960
somebody already has

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,799
uh and then uh these other uh things

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
down about below are um

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,480
some pretty good libraries actually for

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,160
validating passwords

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
in fact what i love is that two of them

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,080
look like a good

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,320
short but good passwords themselves um

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,240
there is where we have n-o-b-s-p-w

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,320
that's the no password

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,720
uh validator strong password and zxcvbn

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,240
um actually zxcvbn looks like it's a

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,760
strong password but if you're sat in

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,760
front of a laptop right now

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,880
or a keyboard and just check the bottom

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,919
row of that keyboard

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,640
you'll find the letters said xcvbn next

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,400
to each other

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,400
so it's as about as secure as the

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,360
password qwerty

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,160
don't use it but it's cool uh and so i

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,799
want to just

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,000
show a couple of bits on these um so

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,200
that

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,640
the no password checker um

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,960
this one's great because that allows you

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,120
to add a bunch of

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,480
um options to it we're not just checking

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
the password but we're checking the

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,200
context as well

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,960
and so in this particular case we can

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
add a name and a username and an email

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,520
alongside the password that we're

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,080
checking

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,440
and uh and then we can say is this

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
strong or is this weak

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,280
and even better like what are the

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,840
reasons for this as well why has this

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,600
been decided that it's a weak password

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,559
um i think this is great uh zxcvbn on

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,760
the other hand

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,320
um this one allows you to provide a word

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,320
list

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,679
uh so this doesn't uh it's not to do

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,080
with whether it's a username or whatever

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,080
but

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,880
you can give it a bunch of words it also

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,400
has a dictionary checker with it as well

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,159
this one gives you a score it gives you

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,200
suggestions it gives you

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,240
uh the time it takes to crack it as well

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,240
and there's one other thing i really

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,280
like about zx cvbn

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,880
is that this the ruby version is

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,760
actually a port of a javascript version

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,679
that was originally written by dropbox

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,840
the good thing about that is that we can

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,919
then use zxcvbn

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,360
on both the front end and the server

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,919
side to give

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,039
users both instantaneous feedback but

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,159
also the same

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,360
password uh validation experience

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,120
whether they're doing in the front end

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,159
or if they skip past that to the back

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,000
end

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,240
um actually i want to show you these uh

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,559
in action because i do think they are

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,360
pretty cool so if we just jump into irb

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,400
right now and

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,240
um we can uh explore things

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,480
and uh if you have passwords you'd like

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,640
to uh you'd like to be checked

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,919
uh live in this talk pop them into the

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,400
youtube chat and i will

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,440
i'll run them through the checker here

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,280
because if we take

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:39,200
no no bspw

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,200
and its password

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,200
that's it a password um what was the one

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,400
i was using film

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,400
rules i like that um but we've passed a

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,679
username as well

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,919
uh nice

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,960
uh i can look at that and i can check uh

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,080
whether it's weak

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,280
uh and it is weak that is weak

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,640
uh no no it's yes well okay

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,760
now i can see that uh some people

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,039
putting their real passwords in and

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,360
that's why we're getting stars coming

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,480
through

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,919
i yeah i see the problem here um is the

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,280
password weak yes it is

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,200
and this is the best thing like we can

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,159
look at the reasons that it's weak and

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,159
in this particular case

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,840
i included the username and the password

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,520
other than that it's quite a long one

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,039
i think um nob spw likes things to be

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,640
kind of

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,640
nine or ten characters long before it

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,919
stops saying it's a short password

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:38,799
um so i really like that uh

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,799
what if we do um whoops

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:47,039
i'll just uh just check out uh oops 123.

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,960
oh i just went up to two um and that one

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,960
is weak because it's too short i think

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
reasons uh possibly too short and too

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,280
common

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,600
so uh it does come with an obs pw comes

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,280
with

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,720
a a bunch of um common passwords with it

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,919
so we can check against that and so

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,840
actually like you know if we did the

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:11,120
same thing with uh

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,120
just the password uh password um

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,559
at that point it's also weak uh yeah and

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,880
the reasons there's gonna be common

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,320
password again uh and that's still the

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,600
same like you know if we have

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,400
password one bang as well it's uh

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,760
weak it's not weak that's right so this

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
one falls down a little actually it's

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,000
not it's not my favorite for that this

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,400
one

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
uh so no psp pw had some good things but

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
it still falls down a little bit

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
on those pattern-based passwords so

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,320
let's take a look at

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:48,400
my absolute favorite which is said xcvbn

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,400
and we can do zxcbn.test

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,720
i can't type now uh we're gonna test

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,159
test like password

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,799
one one bang uh and

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,520
here uh we get like a score this goes

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,840
from uh

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,919
zero to four where zero is terrible and

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,960
um four is unbeatable

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,400
uh so this is zero so we get like the

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,080
crack time uh which is really quick

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,000
uh and actually we can display that and

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,240
it has like instant so you can write a

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,520
message back to your user saying uh this

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,080
is a terrible password

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,600
it'll be instantly cracked uh and it

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,640
comes with like feedback

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,080
i like this so we've got a warning uh

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,960
it's similar to commonly used password

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,039
or it gets a comment

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,120
password and we also have like

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,520
suggestions suggestions is really good

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,320
we've got built in suggestions to say

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,760
hey

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,440
this is how you can make your your

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,360
password better um

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,880
this is just a just a cracking library

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,600
for that kind of stuff

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,159
um i'm going to move on because i

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,840
realize

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,200
i'm i'm talking just quite a lot and

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,400
coding a bit and

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,520
oh where did i put my uh slides there

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
they are

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,440
cool so that was uh that was that but

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
what about those insecure passwords

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,360
now we've seen how we can add dictionary

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,120
checks to things like nobis pw

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,159
or um or uh zlx cvbn

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,799
um but what about those hacked passwords

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,159
um well thankfully uh have i been pwned

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,039
which has been collecting

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,520
all of these password breaches has uh

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,840
what's called the phone passwords api

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
um and so point passwords is now is

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,880
currently

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,880
at last count a list of 572 million 611

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,600
621 passwords that have been previously

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,400
exposed in various data breaches

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,960
whoo that's quite a lot of passwords so

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,159
you know

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,400
good chance you're going to pick one

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,960
that's in there so we should help our

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,720
users out and like i said there's an api

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,960
now you might be worried about this if

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,360
particularly if you're security-minded

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,480
uh that if we have an api where we send

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,640
passwords

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,159
uh to somebody's api to check if they're

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,480
valid to check if they've been

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,720
preached before then we're just giving

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,600
them more passwords

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,520
and that's that's not that's not smart

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,840
but don't worry that's not how it works

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,039
that is not how it works instead uh when

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,440
you get a password that you want to

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,200
check

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,120
against the phone passwords api you take

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,640
the show one hash of that password

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,640
now i know that's not secure but this is

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,520
about numbers it's a number game

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,559
uh rather than a pure security like

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,559
cracking a thing

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,440
uh game so what you do is you take the

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,679
first five characters of that hash

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,559
and then you make the request to the api

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,360
which is at

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,200
uh api to pump and passwords.com range

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,120
that five character prefix

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,240
and that is going to give you a list

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,240
back of

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,880
a bunch of uh remainders of hashes

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,520
and if your last set of characters in

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,000
your hash

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,440
is in anywhere in the list then it has

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
been cracked and you can get the number

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
of uh

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
times it's been breached not cracked

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,559
breached uh before

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,600
and so i wrote a gem for this uh just to

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,279
make it easier because

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,880
i know nobody likes dealing with just

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,760
show and hashes on their own

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,120
uh and so i am going to break that gem

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,720
out just quickly as well

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,720
it is just called boned i believe

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,760
that uh nobody had taken a gem called

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,240
poned yet

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,279
when i wrote this which is something and

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,600
so we can use

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,320
uh pwned and you know it has a nice

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,840
object model where we do password

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:21,840
uh new uh password

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
um

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,480
and we can check if it was phoned uh

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,080
which of course the word password has

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,120
been and then you can be like how many

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,000
times

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,840
how many times have we seen the password

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,159
password in paso breaches

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,840
yes it is 359 315.

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,600
um but there's an easier way to check

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,520
this as well uh we can just do the

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:49,600
phone count of any password so even

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,760
our friend password one bang

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,760
uh has been in uh breaches four thousand

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,960
two hundred and twenty one times

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,720
uh now what were uh um

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,000
we had some suggestions earlier well

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,640
yeah yeah uh

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,720
so actually i thought well hundred seven

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,559
hundred two

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,000
seven seven's been in eight thousand

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,600
five hundred and fifty four times under

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,559
two seventeen thousand

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:17,919
uh times as you can see um my uh

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:21,039
my first password uh apparently

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,960
breached 2192 times which is

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,159
uh mad and i only imagine actually

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,760
that's quite low because there's got to

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,760
be some restrictions on passwords in

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,640
most places that four characters

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,960
isn't enough uh an atom less popular but

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,080
still

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,640
pretty breached um

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,720
somebody asked to check uh in this case

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,679
password or special character right

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,760
there

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,880
one two three uh yeah of course it's

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,200
there 1148 times that's that's

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,520
what you're thinking uh pretty much

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,080
anything with the word password in

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,279
uh has been uh breached a number of

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,520
times

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,480
um and of course i think the most

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,600
important one

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,000
uh to check here is uh correct as

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,080
hannah's

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,120
put it in there i think yeah correct

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,720
horse

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,559
battery staple yes four times

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:15,200
um uh which is slightly less time

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,679
than my supposedly uh strong one has and

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,399
people without spaces 123 times

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,440
so you know um bad times bad times

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,520
everyone

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,799
uh sorry about that um

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,640
i actually haven't found a password that

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,120
wasn't phoned yet what if we put a one

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,360
on there

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,200
11 yep okay and an exclamation point

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,880
we've got a secure password don't use

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,399
that one though

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,960
um so

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,559
that's the phone gem um you can use it

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,679
on its own and it comes with an active

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,360
record validator

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,960
or if you're using device we actually

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,640
there's a there's a plug-in to device to

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,200
validate your passwords with that

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:58,399
as well um so use that

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,000
uh uh one nice thing about the uh api or

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,240
so the uh the gem and the

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,360
and the device plug-in is very much that

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,039
uh um

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,399
because this is an api that sits between

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,840
you and the user sign up

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,240
uh it does allow you to kind of set up

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,200
what what happens if the api fails so

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,600
you won't just uh

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,320
lose access to new users if the api

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,159
disappears

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,320
however the api is also like cached on

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,440
cloudflare uh backed up by

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,080
azure functions and and has a

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,799
super quick response time so it's

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,799
actually really good to use

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,880
and then there's the next level finally

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,760
uh once we've made everyone's passwords

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,279
better

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,720
or if you decide you can't make people's

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,919
passwords better but you want to keep

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
them safe in another way

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,840
and i don't have time to go into it

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
today but a two-factor authentication

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,880
or some sort of multi-factor

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,200
authentication uh

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
will keep your place even more secure

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,760
now that has its own

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,200
uh issues its own um potential problems

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,720
and i'd love to talk to anybody about

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,840
that like get in touch with me at any

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,039
time if you want to talk too fast

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,720
authentication

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:04,480
um because i love talking about that too

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,200
uh so passwords are terrible uh i think

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,039
the chat

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,640
has uh has agreed with me that passwords

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,720
are terrible some people

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,399
have uh become password managers

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,840
themselves for other people i think

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,480
uh which is not a great place to be

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,960
either um so passwords are terrible

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,640
those password guidelines are not only

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,200
worse but they are out of date

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,840
if you are still using guidelines where

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,679
um

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,120
uh where it's an uppercase lowercase a

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,919
number and a special character that has

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,679
to get changed

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,080
uh often it's out of date uh so update

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,440
that guidance uh make the passwords

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,960
longer if

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,559
if you have an application right now

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,559
that has a minimum password length of

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,880
six or eight characters just bump it up

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,720
just bump it up i'd like to see 13 14

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,159
but like if you can get it to 10

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,880
we're to make things better for our

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,559
users ultimately and safer for them in

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,720
our applications

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,640
um checking out those breaches the phone

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,360
passwords api is just an absolute

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,120
um savior of that kind of thing and

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,159
dictionaries and contextual words as

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,399
well

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,200
don't have people using common words

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,240
common

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,919
uh phrases and finally

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,760
implement two facts with education when

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,120
you get to it i promise you you'll also

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,919
make yourselves happy with that that

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,919
is all i've got for you on passwords

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,960
today this evening this morning as it is

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,600
me already

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,640
um it's been an absolute pleasure uh to

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,960
talk with you

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,640
um and thank you very much come find me

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,720
online i'll answer any questions if

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,720
we've got time

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,679
yes well uh yes i hope there is time to

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,000
have some some questions one one moment

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,480
i

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,919
heard myself but if i pull this thing

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,720
out i cannot hear you so this is going

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,159
to be funny

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,240
i'll put this thing back in when i ask

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,679
you a question so

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,760
um most importantly you talk about

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,880
well things that we can fix for our

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,880
users by making sure

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,960
we can fix our users by making sure

00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,799
we'll have some validation

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,919
in place so for me that is just

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,760
one web request too late

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,840
we have authentication in place to make

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,919
sure that our users are

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
well doing the things right that is fine

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,679
but how do we actually

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,559
improve our user how do we make sure

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,480
that

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,519
maybe they don't have

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,000
multi-authentication but how do we make

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,240
sure

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,159
they they they start generating proper

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,919
passwords

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,600
that's a great question uh and it's one

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,320
of the reasons uh like i said that

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,600
um zx cvbn is such a great library to

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,799
use that you can use it on the server

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,360
side and on the

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,279
the client side as well uh and it comes

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,840
with those suggestions out of the box

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,600
i mean there you can build um uh you can

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,200
then also

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,840
zxcvbn had the um uh score that came

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,399
along with it

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,080
so uh that score can give you quite a a

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,880
good idea of um

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,360
how to build like a a password rating

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
thing

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,960
uh you've seen like password strength

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,559
monitors before but they normally are

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,559
trying to they're normally doing that

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,640
kind of regex has it got a

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,000
um has it got a capital letter hasn't

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,919
got a thing uh but

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,799
again zxcb zxcvbn uh is doing that based

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,359
on the entropy

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,079
of the password as well so if we get

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,919
give those

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,839
ideas um as part of the as part of the

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,359
process of putting in the password um

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,960
we are saving the user at that point and

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,520
we're educating them as well

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,879
yeah i think um so i i'm happy to

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,720
suggest as well like

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,839
uh always having like you know 14

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,200
characters at least because that's

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,800
actually what we do at twilio

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,560
yeah i mean i i do understand it's very

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
good idea to to make sure that they

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,919
can't

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,440
enter and well a password is not long

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,359
enough but how do we actually

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,280
instead of using a web form make sure

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,399
our users change instead of our web

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,399
forms get safer

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,320
how do we make sure our users get safer

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,720
by just thinking the right thoughts by

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,720
default

00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:02,400
changing user behavior like that is uh

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:05,760
possibly beyond me

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,400
because beyond most of us i'd have

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,520
imagined

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,240
um it's a long

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,160
it's a long long period uh it's a long

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,880
time

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,160
it's going to take a long time to get to

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,480
a stage where

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,079
uh all users have a better idea of how

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,640
this actually should work

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,800
and it's potentially by that point that

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,320
we can even do away with passwords

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:33,920
uh in general now i'm i'm

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,400
i believe that like passwordless logins

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,119
are

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,320
are very can be really secure and a

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,800
great experience

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,520
and better for users but i also think

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,520
we're not

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,599
in a place yet that we could use those

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,400
things and so that's a potential for the

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,160
future

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,119
with um uh standards like

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,400
uh web authn uh which are gonna bring

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,040
kind of hardware

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,640
and and users together to actually never

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,240
have to use a password again

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,760
that's an exciting future but we're

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,079
we're not there yet but maybe

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,680
maybe that will be the way that we can

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,000
sort these things out

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,440
yeah no no i understand so what you're

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,560
saying actually is

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,720
with all the things you've just

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,079
presented they are not the best thing

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,520
possible but they are so

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,640
better than what we have had until now

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,320
that's the idea um if we can just uh

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,320
move and protect the users that are on

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,960
our sites and

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,800
again like i think by having like

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,079
validations and suggestions based on our

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,560
things that is gonna

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,599
inch uh user behavior on other sites

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,520
over as well

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,359
and uh you know if we can suggest

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,119
password managers if we can suggest

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,560
just saving it in your browser but using

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,760
a uh

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,640
a unique password per site that's a good

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,200
thing yeah

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,839
um i like i'm i use firefox most of the

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,720
time and

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,839
uh uh in a new password scenario firefox

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,280
at the moment is like

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,040
hey would you like this generated

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,560
password this this random one how about

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,079
this i'm like no i'll do the

00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,680
my actual personal manager will do that

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,320
but um

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,280
we have to just edge people to that but

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,599
you just you just know that

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,000
i think that the percentage of people

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,119
using password managers is so low that

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,320
um any any any improvement is

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,560
is something no

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,240
i'm trying to roll out a password

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,599
manager in the organization i'm working

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,119
for at the moment

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,800
with all the struggles that we have had

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,240
there also because well i'm also a

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
developer and also focusing on other

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,640
things

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,320
i think i know what you're talking about

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,240
because well

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,680
a random joe is just not going to use a

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,000
password manager so

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,680
the next best thing is make sure that

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,920
the services they interact with

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,160
uh make the right decision for them

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
without being too obnoxious

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,800
and then your well your other

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,480
alternatives is still like passwordless

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,359
stuff like if you do magic links for

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,800
login like

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,680
like slack does or um yeah or like text

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,599
links to

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,960
sms based links to log in that kind of

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,960
thing can also get

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,040
around things but have their own issues

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,960
as well um

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,359
yeah yeah there there's a thing that i

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,000
forgot just before your talk i want to

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,079
um to

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,839
let the audience pick a developer

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,680
dilemma well thank god my colleague

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,760
floor made sure it was in the chat but i

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,800
have a developer dilemma for you

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,119
it's quite connected to your uh talk

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,400
it is a developer dilemma and you get to

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,920
you get to choose

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,079
i don't know if you if you know the

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,280
developer dilemmas i've not seen this

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,280
before but

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,640
so we're not even showing you them so

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,359
don't worry

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,800
on the one hand you have being hacked

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,359
and you can choose that

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,839
even over or maybe the other way around

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,440
getting

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:44,640
off so uh what is your choice

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,760
uh i'm gonna go with that almost seems

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,119
like an easy one um

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,200
getting ddosed absolutely um

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,160
yeah i would rather i would rather have

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,480
my service or

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,920
whatever is is getting ddosed i'd rather

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,200
have that down

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,000
uh than have people's uh data spilling

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,400
out into the world

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,359
or or getting hacked and you know even

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,320
personally

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,880
like when i lost uh access to spotify

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,240
and skype accounts like i felt violated

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,160
uh especially because my skype account

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,599
was used for such weird things

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,359
um so uh yeah oh no throw

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,359
throw far too much traffic at me

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,359
wherever i am i'm very happy with that

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,400
over being hacked

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:28,000
nice um well the end result is

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:32,079
let me let me give it a second

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,640
only 19 chooses to be had

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,359
rest really likes to be ddos so i think

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,000
um

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,359
yeah you're on to something 19 still

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,240
seems like a

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,480
one in five people are like yeah hack me

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
yes

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,720
i guess it's all a learning experience

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,040
well you have to experience at least

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,040
once

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,400
um thank you a lot for uh for your talk

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,000
educating us making sure that we will be

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,680
safer in the future

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,119
um and uh yeah hopefully we'll get to a

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,240
future where passwords are i think of

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,640
