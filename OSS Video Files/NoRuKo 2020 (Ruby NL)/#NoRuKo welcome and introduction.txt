00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
right over there hello i'm arnaud

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,080

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,760
hey everybody so welcome

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,079
on this wonderful friday afternoon

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,719
there's a lot of people tuning in now

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:39,680

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,680

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,719
there's like uh on in holland we have

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,399
this thing called

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,840
freemibo so have you heard of that ramon

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
no not until now okay so a freemibow is

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
a

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,199
abbreviation for friedrich

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
middaughborough basically which

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,000
literally

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,080
translates to friday afternoon drinks

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,520
so basically i think that a lot of

i'll be giving you a quick tour of what

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,560
you can expect today

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,440
from us week about two tracks

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,959
the main and community tracks on the

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,239
community track

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,519
the emceeing will be headed up by arno

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,840
can you give us a little wave or

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
something arnold i don't know if you're

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,599
there uh

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,159
let me get all my hello and yeah so i'll

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,080
be your

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
mc for the main track sorry for the

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
community trip because you're looking at

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,599
the main track

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,840
you can potentially from time to time

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,519
see me because actually

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,200
this is where we'll be standing to

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
present to you so at least you can have

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,640
a look

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,080
over here if you can't get enough of me

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,280
and if you want to have a look at the

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,720
community track you can clearly see

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,599
the best of writer because we can see

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,599
each other

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,919
so you can see two tricks at the same

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,720
time i think it's so important to show

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,520
both sides at the same time yes

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,400
so what we've got here is as said our

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
main track

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,639
where we'll get presentations from mats

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,160
penelope tatiana

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,520
tom allison yulik and kirk

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
what you can also expect there is a

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,639
musical intermezzo a little bit more on

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
that later

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
let's have a look at the community track

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,680
so

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,280
before the community track starts at

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
four o'clock we'll be having our

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,400
presentation from mats

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,320
so once that presentation ends feel free

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,040
to head over to the community track

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,160

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,440
but what about the venue for us see

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,639
it's very important for us to show that

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,800
we're taking the proper safety

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,960
precautions

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
the cor the core team finds themselves

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
in a position where they're all together

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,680
however they're taking the proper

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
precautions of staying well distance

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
from another

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,919
and wearing protective gear when

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,080
necessary

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,160
they're currently at full stacks office

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,960
which is their center of operations

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,639
of full stack we want to thank full

so you might have no you might have

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,399
noticed that euroco 2020 was supposed to

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
take

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,040
place today but it's not good it's not

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,920
been completely canceled

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,880
on the contrary euroco in finland will

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,920
take place

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,920

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,279
they've also informed us that they've

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,920
opened up a little store where you can

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,000
pick up

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,200
a little bit of swag they've got some

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,640
mass some stickers

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,800
and a eureka pillow that's definitely

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,600
not going to put me to sleep

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,600

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,279

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,320
