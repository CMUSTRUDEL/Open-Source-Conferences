Description: 
	Git is about talking to your team. It’s about talking to yourself, from the future. What about that colleague who hasn’t even joined the team yet? Yes, them too. But how to be "good at Git"?

Tom de Bruijn is a developer at AppSignal, writing in Ruby, Rust, Elixir and JavaScript. Tom writes novels in his free time, which he'll probably publish... one day. Tom helps organize the monthly Amsterdam Ruby meetup, Rails Girls Netherlands events, and previously the EuRuKo 2019 Rotterdam conference.

Welcome to the #NoRuKo conference. A virtual unconference organized by Stichting Ruby NL.
