Playlist: #NoRuKo 2020
Description: 
	We had the honor to perform at NoRuKo 2020 in the 18:00 break and it was very cool. half/byte created most of his sound with Ruby and combined this with some custom audio samples. NERDDISCO had a ruby shader (aka diamond) in combination with a rainbow nebula as the main visual element.
