Title: The struggle for better documentation for Ruby itselfby Victor Shepelev | #NoRuKo 2020
Publication date: 2020-09-11
Playlist: #NoRuKo 2020
Description: 
	Ruby is known to be "complex language for writing simple code" and "designed to make programmers happy". Yet while those principles are fully embodied in the language spirit and logic, the documentation is traditionally more problematic, especially for newcomers who are already programming-literate and expect a quick and deep dive. Let's talk about several aspects of language and standard library documentation, its history, current state, and the future, expectations it should ideally meet and some unfortunate road bumps. 

Victor Shepelev is an Ukrainian programmer and poet with twelve years of programming experience and fifteen years of Ruby programming. Working at Verbit.ai, mentoring students (including Google Summer of Code-2016-2018, as a mentor for SciRuby organization), developing open source (Ruby Association Grant 2015).

Welcome to the #NoRuKo conference. A virtual unconference organized by Stichting Ruby NL.

i think for us it's time to introduce uh

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,080
victor shkelev

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,359
and he's going to have to talk about the

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,120
documentation of

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,840
ruby itself and the word

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,559
struggle in there well that doesn't

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,840
sound good

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,320
anyway he's a ukrainian developer

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,039
sorry he calls himself a programmer and

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,359
poet

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,840
so he's a programmer and poet with 12

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,880
years of experience

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,039
and 15 years of ruby programming so it's

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,000
at 12 years of experience with poetry

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,920
and 15 of

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,600
in in development i don't know probably

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,120
you can you can answer that uh

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,800
later then he is working at the moment

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,120
at uh

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,200
verbit.ai and and he's also

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
mentoring students for well the google

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,840
summer of code

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,440
and he's a he's mentoring other projects

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,399
and he's a developer of open source

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,520
software uh victor

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,239
hi um is that 12 years of experience as

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,320
a poet

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:05,199
and 15 years developing a room

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,760
well it's uh 12 years of programming it

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,960
was c

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
plus plus before ruby and as a poet it's

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,360
probably

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,560
more like 37 because i'm 37 old

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,960
uh yeah okay

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
well i'd like to start with your

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,360
presentation

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,240
tell us about the struggle for the

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,439
documentation of ruby itself

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,640
okay let's start uh so uh

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,960
i'm here to uh tell tell you about the

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,759
documentation of the ruby itself

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
uh as was already told but i'll

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,360
reiterate because

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,040
some of it is important uh i am

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,600
developing in ruby for

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
like real really long time i really in

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,079
love with ruby and i

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,360
wanted to stay my main language for for

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,840
the next year

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
and uh i am also mentoring students in

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,600
ruby for

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,439
maybe last five years and that's when i

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,880
started to notice that

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,200
uh things in our documentation might be

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,920
better and started to doing something

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,880
about

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
talks about the language itself uh so

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,160
you might uh

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
recognize me as the guy who when who

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,640
invented the

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,239
uh kernel zen method which uh is uh like

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,959
uh splitted the community uh and uh

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,239
some some other nice things latest

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,840
versions of ruby

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,920
uh i also added a lot of docs in

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,040
recent versions and i maintain the

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,040
ruby reference site which i'll uh

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,080
talk a bit uh through the course of this

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,800
talk and

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
even was recognized for this effort by

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
fukuoka

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,400
ruby award which i uh honestly

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,920
quite quite proud of uh so

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,480
uh let's uh ask ourselves

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,959
ourselves this question uh how's our

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
docs

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:02,080
like uh i mean not uh

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,959
the tutorial blog posts or books which

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,560
we we know they are quite cool there are

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
a lot of good authors there are

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,599
a lot of helpful people of the on the

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,360
internet but like the base language dogs

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,720
uh to uh dive into this question

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,920
i urge you to uh to ask yourself

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,360
some some like random sample questions

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,879
which all of them uh uh from my

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,720
mentoring experience

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,270
this is questions which uh students uh

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,280
ask quite often and

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,000
[Music]

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
trying to answer them i sometimes

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
stumble

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,799
on to on to the fact that even some

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,760
basic questions about ruby is

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,159
not easy to find in our documentation

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,360
like

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,360
uh if if you go into the question uh of

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,159
file read which is in

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,040
every tutorial and every code piece you

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
will not find

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
the meta description because it's

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,159
actually i o read which

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,280
file uh is uh inherited from and

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,000
for novices it's uh like uh struggling

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,200
point and

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,120
uh there are much more like uh

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,120
what what are blocks and where to find

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
documentation for them

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
in the base language documentation uh

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,079
what are

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
our code documentation conventions and

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,560
how it's

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,560
typically done and

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
what's uh what good things in our

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,080
standard library it is not

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,960
that easy to find if you try to find the

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,759
answers of

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,280
for some some of those like quite basic

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,240
basic questions

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,639
we'll stumble upon this that's a section

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
of

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,880
uh official ruby's site

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,320
regarding the documentation it links to

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,440
some uh

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,960
quite good and adored materials like

00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,560
wise point appointment guide to ruby is

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,080
probably what all of us all the rubies

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,880
started with like uh

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:12,880
there are some some coins ruby monk some

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,240
good tutorials but um it is uh

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,639
not that helpful when you start today

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
uh because on the part of the reference

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,400
documentation

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,600
again on on the same official site

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,120
you'll find like

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,160
quite a lot of links to several

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,120
again good good and helpful sites

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,160
which are so confusing confusing for the

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
newcomers

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,199
for example if you go to for the first

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
link

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,440
in the ruby language uh

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,800
official site uh to the link to official

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,160
ipad documentation

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,440
uh you'll see this that's like docs ruby

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
langork that's where

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,639
everything is and

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,360
i ask you to to look at the left section

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,919
of this

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,840
where like the basics of language is

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,880
described it's not

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,840
uh some structured table of contents

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,639
is just the default rendering of all the

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,520
files

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,240
in docs folders in uh like alphabetical

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,280
order and

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,000
if you start to learn ruby from this

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,319
uh you'll be confused and of course we

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,639
understand that a lot of people start

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,479
with tutorials start with books

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,600
but uh for the

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,880
the base experience the experience to

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
return to their like

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,479
the main documentation for the language

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,319
for experience of

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,479
ex of programmers of other languages who

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,400
tries to switch to ruby or just

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,919
look at it and what's interesting there

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,360
it's not that helpful

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,080
if you look further in this uh

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
table of contents on official docs site

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,960
you'll see like

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,639
all all the classes from uh core classes

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,080
standard library classes

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
everything everything just in

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,560
alphabetical order and

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
it uh it is confusing it is um

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,000
confusing not not just because uh

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
there is a lot of this stuff but because

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,599
the stuff is organized

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,680
in uh in a manner of uh

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,680
like the the default programmers manage

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
just just alphabetical order of

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,440
everything

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,840
we have several different uh renderings

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
of

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,120
uh this core documentation

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,880
like ruby.org uh and so on and so on

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,080
uh they are uh competing uh

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,160
in google for when you google something

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,000
and uh some of them are rendered better

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,280
some of them are rendered in

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,319
in more modern styles but uh in my

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,680
experience

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,000
nasa of them provides the like reference

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,280
experience the experience of

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,479
giving the whole picture and

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,160
another another huge problem uh

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,919
which uh can be found in our

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
documentation especially when you are

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,400
mentoring students or when you are

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,599
helping

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,000
less experienced colleagues uh that uh

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,960
some some of the very core things in in

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,440
the language

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,280
they are documented sparsely uh of

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,520
course it's understandable

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,520
because uh language is evolving because

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,319
lot of people work on it because stuff

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,080
changes

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,720
uh frequently and uh and a lot and uh to

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,080
be honest

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,840
this uh example of uh the pros one

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,680
one of the main concepts on ruby

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,919
documentation and how sparse

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,519
it is uh it is related to uh version 2.

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,959
2.5 and since then it became better

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,640
for for a few versions

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,440
then it became like uh over documented

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,440
if you'll go

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,080
to to the masters version pros

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,080
documentation you'll

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
see something which looks like a book

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,800
about protests like

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,440
uh spanning several several long

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,480
long screens with all the details where

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,880
again for

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,080
newcomer or for switcher from from

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,200
another language it's

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,279
uh hard to find the

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,880
uh like the the essence the call the

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,000
core of this experience

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,800
uh so uh to assume

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,279
to sum it up what what is uh problematic

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,480
in

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:28,880
our current language docs the depth

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,279
it's uh really varying for um

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
even for some of the core classes the

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,959
dogs

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
currently is various parts uh for some

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,800
of them

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,519
they were absent uh uh as

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,519
uh as recently as as for previous

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
previous versions and it was recently

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,560
fixed by

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:52,560
work on a few few deca dedicated people

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,839
and uh some some of those dogs are

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
uh vice versa over doc some of those

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,000
classes

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,480
and methods are over documented uh some

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,040
of those classes are hard to discover

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,360
because

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,040
if you'll go for example to the standard

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,160
library documentation

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,480
it would be a large mix up of libraries

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,160
that

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,519
are convenient for everyday life like

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,079
i don't know past name or json and so on

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
and for libraries that are suited in

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,640
very particular

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,760
purpose some of them are outdated uh

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,440
then uh there are such a

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,920
huge message of docs that some aspects

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,360
uh became contradicting each other if

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,320
you'll try to go

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,800
through the file docs and then temp file

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
docs

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,880
and uh try to understand all the options

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,279
with which you can

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,120
read or write files or temp files and so

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,959
on uh you'll

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,880
most likely be lost and the

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,399
most the the last but not least and very

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,880
important problem is that

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,600
actuality on documentation as my hobby

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,920
project i am working on um

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,800
annotated list of all the changes in

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,320
recent ruby

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,680
versions i started the work at uh

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,839
version 2.6 then i covered

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:19,519
2.7 and went back to 2.4 and 2.3

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,160
uh and uh document uh documenting the

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,800
changes

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,680
in each version in each version even as

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,560
old as 2.3 it's like five years

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,600
uh i found stuff that was in the change

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,480
log which is

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,880
good good useful things but which are

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,000
not in uh current documentation

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,240
uh people are trying to fix it uh

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,560
some of it is already fixed some some of

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,360
the of it is discussed how to fix and so

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,200
on

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:51,279
uh but uh in general

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,639
in general our dogs uh like they they

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,760
deserve more more love uh when

00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:01,839
i started to learn ruby like

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,920
almost 20 years ago the go-to thing was

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,240
programming ruby book by pragmatic

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,560
programmers it was really awesome as a

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,959
documentation and explanation for the

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,240
like

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,120
whole language it started with uh really

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,120
simple stuff

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,200
and went all the way to to reference to

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,920
entire language and reference to entire

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
library

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,240
and it was uh like super helpful it was

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
my

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,639
go to pdf for for several years

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,760
unfortunately

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,320
the book haven't been updated uh for

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
for the next version so the most

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,120
recently available one

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:43,040
it is like for 1.9

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
plus some something from 2.0 and since

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,079
then

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,600
ruby changed it significantly and the

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:52,079
preferred community style

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:55,200
style changed significantly and um uh

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,760
now we have a lot of books

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,040
that are helpful to different aspects

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,920
but we

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,920
seem to not have a good overall

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,120
reference

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,399
can it be better when uh

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:15,120
well we can look at our like

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:18,240
friends our competitors if you'll go to

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,200
python's docs uh you'll see and at the

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,320
documentation

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,519
sites have a helpful list of

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,800
very actual links to

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,200
documents to current versions and uh

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,920
if you go through the reference link

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,440
you'll

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,920
you'll see like the structured reference

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,320
for

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
all the language aspects starting from

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,320
from like

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,519
uh simple exams and and going all the

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,800
way through the library

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,680
if you'll go to uh rust site you'll see

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
the same

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,680
if you'll go to elixir side if you'll go

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,720
to php site

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,880
uh the uh most of the languages

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,240
in existence i'll i'll just stop here

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,800
but uh there's

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,600
more slides with other languages uh what

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,399
can be done

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,760
what is uh let's say humanly possible

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,440
possible to do

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,160
uh so what we want is the uh

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,639
reference reference reference the thing

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,480
that

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,760
covers uh not uh some uh

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,120
interesting aspects not uh like what is

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,959
what is the documentation for this

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,240
particular class i am

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:29,279
working with currently but uh the whole

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
the whole picture and this whole picture

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,920
that can

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,240
can be read like uh can be read from

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,160
from top to bottom or accessed

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,440
uh where you can easily easily find the

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,040
parts you are interested in and

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,000
and uh at this point uh we

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,000
still don't have at least official

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,959
reference for the ruby language

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,760
and uh not not only language and the

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,040
library but

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,519
also deeper aspects like how

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
how do you embed the ruby another

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,240
program how do you

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,240
write an extension and so on

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,279
but we know that we have like a

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,800
great community we know that people are

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,399
super helpful

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,040
on reddit on twitter on uh on official

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,240
mail list

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,839
i was when i was started i was like

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,240
really fascinated when i

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,320
wrote to ruby talk mailing list uh

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,920
maybe like third week my studying of

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,199
rubies

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,079
as i now understand uh very dumb

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,880
question and

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,759
in very bad english even even worse than

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,040
it is now

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,839
and uh i received its answer from matt

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,279
himself

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,480
he he was not like uh too lazy

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:53,519
or too uh

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,519
looking looking from from the top of the

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,199
hill here he just answered no no it

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
works this way and that way you you can

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,040
try this

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,519
and and it would work but uh

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,720
the existence of the reference it is

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,240
important because

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,880
it creates the programming languages

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,040
image

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,959
not in public relations sense

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,600
though in public relation sense sense

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,600
too but

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,440
more in a sense of how

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,759
how we perceive the language how is a

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,399
newcomer starting to work with language

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,839
perceives

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,839
it like uh whether

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,839
whether they they perceive it like

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,959
something they they can

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,800
just read a book about and understands

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,600
uh uh how things are related or they are

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,079
picking up

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,800
like this exact trick didn't did you

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,680
know blog

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,279
blog posts and some random answers on

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,759
stack overflow and they became

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,560
kind of proficient in the language but

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,759
but still

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,800
uh some sometimes um

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,120
falling into a deep piece uh of i don't

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,360
know

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,360
different differences between protests

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,959
and and lambdas or

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,360
uh how how how do you efficiently work

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,679
with enumerators and so on and so on

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,120
but it's not only a newcomer problem

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,120
it's a problem for

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,120
uh pragmatic and pragmatic people who

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,959
start to work uh

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,839
like uh grasp the basics then start to

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,160
work with

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,079
real heart problem and they and they're

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,039
super smart and they're super pragmatic

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,960
and they

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,640
know what they know about the language

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,120
and uh

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
allows themselves themselves to ignore

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,000
the rest but

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,200
uh still those uh like pits uh deep uh

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,320
pizza understanding uh uh

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,520
those huge gaps they they are harmful

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,240
for their work

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,520
uh again we know that uh most most of

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,120
the people nowadays

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,120
come come to ruby to work with rails and

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,320
we know that rails have awesome

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,919
documentation and

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,120
some awesome books but uh that's this

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,200
uh creates uh some community which

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,520
knows uh let's say rails as a

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,640
uh like quasi language better than ruby

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,280
itself

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,640
it's not like a bad thing it's not like

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,679
i'm i'm saying that

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,120
i don't know dumb or not professional or

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,000
something something but

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,880
it's just harmful for their their

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
productivity and

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,360
and ruby's language that is uh helpful

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,640
for for productivity when people from

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:39,000
other languages come come to look at uh

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,440
what what interesting things that those

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,320
rubisc

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,799
where where do i read about those things

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,000
um

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,400
this blog post like it it was cool this

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,640
uh

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,760
i don't know triatic on hacker that i

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,120
saw on hiker news

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,720
it was cool but how it is um

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,000
related to the to the whole whole

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,120
uh ruby situation and uh it leads

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,880
to um discrepancy between

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,760
how we perceive tercel ruby

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,799
uh because because we know that it's one

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
of one of the most

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,919
uh consistent languages that i worked

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,440
with

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,760
let's let let's say this to to not be

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,799
too

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,480
too global uh it has like

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,960
small small small core of

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,760
real really well designed features which

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,280
provide

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,640
a lot of expressiveness but

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,320
when you study such a language without

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,679
super good reference uh just just by

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,080
books even good books and blog posts uh

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,400
sometimes you you find yourself in a

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,760
situation when you know that some things

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,240
work and

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,240
you even know how they work but but you

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,320
don't understand why and

00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,679
uh you maybe maybe not don't can't see

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,280
uh how all how some

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,960
things that uh feel like very different

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,000
they are quite similar and they all

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,919
coming from the

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,120
very very small and consistent

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,559
consistent core

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,880
uh so uh we know that in the

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,840
bigger community we are frequently

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,760
perceived and

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:25,039
as people who are working with some uh

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,679
quite esoteric things that are like

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,520
uh cool and magical about this thing but

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,159
will will better stick to

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,280
uh to another things which are not that

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,640
that magical

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,679
i am not saying that um

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,240
this situation which is uh quite quite

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,760
sad from

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,120
for me personally that uh it's uh

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,640
only due to lack lack of

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,440
good dogs but i believe that

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,200
this this fact it it it contributes a

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,760
lot

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,080
so uh can we do it better

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
obviously we can obviously we can

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,799
because

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,760
we have a nice community we

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,200
want our language to prosper we love it

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,760
we are

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,760
proficient with it we are proficient

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,200
with

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:23,280
explaining things we are proficient

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,080
with uh understanding what we don't

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,720
understand

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,440
and explaining it to each other and uh

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,559
when saying

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,919
saying we here i am not meaning like all

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,880
dinosaurs like me

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,799
who wrote and ruby for like 15 years we

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,360
are so proficient will help you

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,840
i am meaning the whole ruby community

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,520
because

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,559
it's uh um it's so supportive

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,520
it's so helpful to each other uh

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,919
that the ruby community is as a whole

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,039
it's

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,080
uh like uh uh it's

00:21:53,039 --> 00:22:00,480
a a powerful powerful thing that uh

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:04,480
can uh can do better

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,679
so what what exactly can be done

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,000
uh i understand that uh

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,360
writing something about something in

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
personal blog or

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:19,760
at your company's blog it is

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,400
maybe more helpful for for your personal

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,360
image

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,320
more helpful for your personal relation

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,039
with the world but

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:32,080
uh sometimes fine finding stuff

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,039
that is not as good explained in

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,400
official docs

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,679
which is not as good understood by

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,559
newcomers or our colleagues it is good

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,520
to

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,919
uh just just stop writing right then and

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,799
there

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,360
and at least think about how how we can

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,600
better

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,559
describe the stuff to each other and to

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,960
others

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,320
uh it is uh the most

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,200
[Music]

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,159
it is a bit harder than right right just

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,919
blog posts

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,520
but uh make a standalone description as

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,880
a small site maybe

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,320
some just some github pages maybe some

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,200
open repository

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
with uh some markdown documentation it's

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,400
like a really

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,440
really good thing and really easy thing

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,559
to do

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,559
uh a bit harder but uh still uh

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:30,640
still pretty accessible to

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,080
to any of us is expanding uh currently

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,280
existing dogs

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,400
it's just a small pool request to

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,159
to ruby main repository and the the

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:46,080
maintainers they are very acceptive to

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,320
pull requests expanding documentation

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,320
and

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,120
i saw a lot of people doing uh

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,000
doing just just their small part just

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,760
like maybe

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,080
fix syntax of uh one outdated example

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,400
and

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,279
you'll you'll make the life of uh

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,799
everybody around you slightly better

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:12,559
uh another thing uh that that is

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:16,559
probably harder to do but but still i'd

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:20,080
like to see people doing it is

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,400
we have a lot of dogs already existing

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,880
but

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
as i shown and you you can see by

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
yourself

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,640
going to official documentation sites uh

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,840
it

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,240
can be just done better uh meaning

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,799
uh for having the stuff more

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,679
discoverable for having the stuff

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,360
like more more readable uh just for

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,919
having the stuff to look

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,279
more modern so people uh coming to our

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,400
documentation

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,080
would not be like taken aback by oh

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,480
this documentation was right on 10 10

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,799
years ago probably it's all outdated and

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,679
not

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,080
interesting and the last but not least

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,360
uh

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,600
i believe that the whole problem of the

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,720
uh like language documentation in

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,840
general uh

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,200
language language basics uh

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,520
language reference it uh can and should

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,880
be

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,240
handled by the community but like it's

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,919
not easy

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,240
uh why it's not easy uh

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,039
to to handle that documentation as a

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,159
whole

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:26,559
uh because uh uh to be honest

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:29,679
this work is not uh as uh

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,960
as thankful as rewarding as even uh

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,840
contributing to

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,720
language visa like new code new methods

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,279
and new new ideas and so on because

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,840
by by the very nature of documentation

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,760
uh those

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,039
who see it now

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,159
in the current state they appreciate it

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,720
as as it is if you enhance it

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,480
if you work on it and the next version

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,360
will be documented better well

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,000
it would be appreciated as it is uh it's

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,400
uh

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,279
hard to find the point when everybody

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,600
everybody says

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,120
okay this new cool documentation is like

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,159
new and cool

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,320
but uh i believe that uh just uh

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:15,760
making things better is uh some somehow

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,880
rewarding itself and the

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:23,039
last big problem is uh

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:28,159
probably this effort requires some

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:30,880
i don't know working groups uh some um

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,240
guidelines and so on currently it works

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,200
the way that uh

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,679
somebody contributes dogs and if they

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
are

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,520
readable if they are better than before

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,559
they they are merged

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,880
it uh sometimes it leads that uh to

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,080
to fact that dogs for different classes

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
and methods they are

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,960
written in uh really different styles

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,960
with different levels of

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,600
digitalization and so on and the

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,960
core coefficients documentation it's

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,120
hard to contribute to

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:06,159
without uh like uh always

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,760
returning to the to the whole picture

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,760
uh i

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,480
tried to do something about it myself

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,600
uh there is a thing that i am calling

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,880
the ruby reference

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:24,159
uh obviously it is not the reference uh

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,360
in the meaning that it's not official uh

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,679
but uh at least it is a reference

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,840
that exists now on the internet and

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,120
looks more or less like

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,640
as a reference to the whole language uh

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,919
i did not wrote this thing myself

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,799
it is like impossible to

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,320
impossible task for for one person but

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,559
what i found out

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,039
when i started to work on it that most

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,000
of the ruby is already recommended so

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,760
my project was to just gather at all in

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,960
some logical structure

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,399
in some modern looking site uh so

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,679
it would look like the documentations

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,120
that other languages

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,240
have that uh uh

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,760
that i'd like like ruby to have

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,960
uh but uh that's just just one effort uh

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,120
just one aspect of of the things and

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,640
a lot of people working on a lot of

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,799
things to improving it

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,280
uh i'm um it's obviously it's hard to

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,200
name

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,320
[Music]

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,200
everybody obviously it's hard to name uh

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,960
like uh all all the dozens and hundreds

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,760
and hundreds of people who are working

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,039
on but

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,520
uh i'd like to some shout out at least

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,320
to

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,480
to some of them to the guy who maintains

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,679
rubydog.org which is uh just

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,320
the random of the official docs uh which

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,919
is

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,240
uh in my opinion like a bit better than

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,240
uh

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,480
the official rendering which is dogs

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,520
through the land or and maintains its

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,880
three years and and makes it running

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,880
to uh the guy who maintains the new site

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,640
uh

00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,000
rubyip.org it's not the reference but

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,720
it's a

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,919
very handy modern and searchable uh

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,840
official documentation again but uh it's

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,559
much easier to navigate than official

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,640
docs

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,720
to the guy who maintain maintains

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,840
the site documentation the documenting

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,600
the

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,600
situation with the uh

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,760
standard library gamification which gems

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,600
are where

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,000
how to maintain them via water as a new

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,520
efforts what are they state and so on

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,440
to to the guy who who maintains

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:56,240
uh a very uh detailed reference to

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,440
cc api of ruby and

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,960
how how to do uh things when you are

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,679
embedding ruby in your

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,440
cmc program or uh

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,640
how to write your ruby gems in sea

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,520
and like there are a lot of people

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,240
who are really really awesome who work

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,679
on different

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,120
aspects who merge

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,360
new and shiny dogs for standard classes

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,360
one

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,919
i just just stumbled on reddit on

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:37,360
some guy who

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,240
like 77 years old and he

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,440
he loves ruby and he loves documentation

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,640
so much that

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,320
uh he emerged i believe in it

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,679
it would be in uh in a future version

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,480
uh new and uh very helpful and detailed

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,840
docs

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,039
uh to uh for most of the

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,519
core classes with uh uh much much

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,159
more friendly explanations and detailed

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,000
examples

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:09,919
and they they so

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,360
uh like everybody who at least once

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,960
tried to explain something about ruby uh

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,880
to uh everybody else they are just

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,440
just awesome and i urge like all of you

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,640
to

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,679
uh to participate in this uh and

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,399
i especially um it is

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,960
especially important that i am talking

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,799
not

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:38,640
only to like my fellow dinosaurs but

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:42,640
uh if you are innovate your perspective

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,640
is super precious because

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,559
for guys who work with ruby for for many

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,640
years

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,799
for guys who maintain ruby it's

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,039
sometimes really hard to see

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:58,159
um which things are hard to understand

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,519
which things i explained in two

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,880
technical details

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:06,000
so uh the novice's perspective the

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,360
new folks perspective uh

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,480
it's uh uh it's precious

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,039
and it should be shared in any

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,679
in any manner that that you see suitable

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,799
just

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,760
uh like a ticketing uh official ruby

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,640
backtracker

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,360
like saying uh why is this that i don't

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,440
understand

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,519
from the documentation can cannot be

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,880
explained this way

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:34,399
uh it it would be uh

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,519
helpful for all of us so

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,320
yeah yeah i i think that this uh

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,120
it's what what i wanted to say let's

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,840
make ruby

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,720
documented better and let's make it

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,120
prosper

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
thank you

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:55,600
nice um i would say thank you very much

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,399
i think well you made a fantastic point

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,600
um

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,960
and well of course we have a chat people

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,320
can ask questions in there so we're

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,519
always looking there and we are

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,480
listening to the talks and thinking well

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,000
what can we ask ourselves

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,600
and the thing is well it's quite clear

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,760
that you have a thing with poetry

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,720
maybe already for 37 years because well

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,760
you're speaking

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,399
well you're well your verbal skills are

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,880
excellent

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,240
um but not only that and it's clear

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,840
you've been mentoring because the point

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,840
you're raising

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
everybody

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,799
he was just like yeah i'm just i'm just

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,840
nodding all the time and that's exactly

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,840
what i feel

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,960
myself as well so thank you very much

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,720
for that

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,519
thank you and what i also think

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,559
is quite interesting and you raised the

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,640
point that

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,880
well you could write a blog you could

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,159
even improve your company's blog but why

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,519
don't you just improve

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,559
everyone's lives and

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,720
for me that means you're actually making

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,440
sure that everyone can be helped by all

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:07,120
the energy we as developers put in so

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:11,040
thank you very much for that thank you

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,960
and and so i think for everyone watching

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,839
now this is the moment that you think oh

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,159
yeah i've

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,639
had that idea that i should have a blog

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,879
already for the last seven years

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,760
here dinosaurs like you're saying or 12

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,879
years

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,159
like you're saying but that we don't

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,520
need that block that we can actually

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,679
make life better for everyone

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:35,040
especially the people beginning even if

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:37,599
they're beginners of 77 years old

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,480
i'd like to say thank you a lot it was a

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,040

uh enlightening talk um everyone

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,720
for everyone who plays start improving

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,240
documentation for ruby

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,560
really thank you victor
