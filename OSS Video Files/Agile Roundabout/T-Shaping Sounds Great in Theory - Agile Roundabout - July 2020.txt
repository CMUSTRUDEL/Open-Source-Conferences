T-Shaping sounds great in theory, but it's very difficult to make it work practically. Hear how a team at Vodafone UK went extreme with T-Shaping and got more than they bargained for...

hi everybody my name's ben i'm an agile

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,120
coach and a scrum master

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,880
at vodafone uk i'm not talking

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
specifically today about agile and

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
lockdown and such but i think there's a

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
lot of values

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,360
that can transfer across i'm actually

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,720
talking about quite a contentious

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,000
issue which is t-shaping um t-shaping

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,080
cross-skilling whatever you want to call

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,960
it it's basically as an individual

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,640
are you fixed on one skill set or do you

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
have a broad skill set so that in your

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
squad

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,480
you can you can attack lots of different

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,800
uh

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,239
user stories that come into the team um

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,600
i'm going to share with you

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,120
a story about an

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,559
experiment that we ran with some of the

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,079
guys at vodafone uk

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,920
let's see if i can go to the next slide

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,160
there we go um

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,360
this is a real team so and i'm proving

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,079
it's a real team because i've got all

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,600
their pictures

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,520
and there's me at the top of the back we

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
were go-karting i actually won

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,120
um which is a miracle because i'm quite

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,559
a big guy so my power to weight ratio

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
isn't great on a cart but

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,840
um this is a team i've been with for a

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,280
couple of years

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,400
um and i i look at agile from a slightly

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,000
different lens because this

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,799
is a a commercial digital marketing team

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
and so it's not a pure development team

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
which

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,680
you often find using agile these guys

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,720
are a mixture of

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,759
commercial managers big data scientists

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,799
um digital analytics comms

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,560
design front end development you name it

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,159
it's a really mixed bunch

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,840
um and we've seen agile work really well

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,520
um but this team specifically are

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
responsible for retention digital

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,960
marketing campaigns so

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,200
cerberus if any of you are familiar is

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,479
the three-headed dog that guards the

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
gates of hades

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,600
um so read into that what you want but

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,960
that's the name that they chose to give

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
themselves when we formed a few years

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
ago

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,479
um this team uh in a couple of

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,960
retrospectives

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,159
were bringing out that they wanted to

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,560
t-shape more

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
because with those very specific skill

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
sets

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,880
you would not have a lot of crossover

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
naturally between like a big data

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,079
scientist

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,520
and a graphic designer or a commercial

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,080
manager

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,239
and a copywriter so although we were a

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,319
cross-functional collaborative team

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,440
sometimes there did feel like handovers

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
within the team

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,040
and actually on quite a few occasions

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,239
the guy says we quite liked t-shape we

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,280
qualified

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,599
but in reality this team are really busy

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
there's a lot of pressure um almost

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,040
anything

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
that we do as a business and there is

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,239
some kind of aspect in our customer base

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
or we have to send out communication so

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,519
it's high pressure

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
so t-shaping and cross-skilling normally

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,840
got pushed

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,239
to the back of the um of the priority

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
list

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,000
um it didn't make it very far at the

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,319
backlog a lot of times so

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
we were having a retrospective and the

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,519
guys got really fed up and they just

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,840
said we really want a t-shape

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,959
so we came up with an idea to run an

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,640
experiment

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,920
um and i put a bit of a tweak on this

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
experiment because i was fed up of

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
hearing them say again we want a t-shirt

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,080
we want a t-shirt with a t-shape and

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
then it getting deep prioritized

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,879
so i came up with an experiment

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,519
whereby we would spend a couple of days

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,040
doing a swarm around a real epic so it

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,680
was a real piece of work

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,800
um and there was going to be a rule that

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,440
you could not

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,200
work on your own job or your own

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,959
discipline as we call it so

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,480
if you're a big data scientist you can't

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,120
do big data science you've got to do

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
something else

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
if you're a graphic designer you can't

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,400
do graphic design you get the picture

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,000
this was a a tangible real epic

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,120
that we broke down into user stories

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,480
um and using our kind of uh historical

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,879
velocity we

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,120
were able to say fairly confidently that

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,040
this was an achievable epic in a few

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,680
days we should be able to get a tangible

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,319
product

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
increment ready and it blew the guys

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,200
minds a little bit that they weren't

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,480
going to be working on their own jobs

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
and that was quite difficult to get

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,120
their heads around but it was almost

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
like an excited moment where they were

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
looking at me and the product owner like

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
oh you know are we really allowed to do

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,599
this and we were like yes we can do it

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,040
um so we created a backlog

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,040
and we got stuck in

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
this is what most of the swarm actually

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,040
or the mini sprint

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,319
whatever you want to call it this is

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,799
what most of the swarm looked like it

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,880
was

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,320
groups of twos and threes gathering

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,959
around one laptop

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
and the in this instance for example

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
here at the front we've got george and

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
marvin and george

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,520
is a digital analytics manager

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,320
and marvin is a campaign operations

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,560
manager

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
so very different job roles and actually

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,240
george was learning how to do

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,800
campaign operations like sending out all

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,320
the emails to our customer base and

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,840
marvin was learning about how we do

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
digital analytics how we analyze

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,320
customers going through the funnel

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,880
and so on and that happened in pairs and

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
threes

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,720
throughout the throughout the uh the

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
swarm

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,479
now i've got to admit i wasn't hugely

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,320
optimistic about getting everything done

00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
i thought it was a stretch i thought it

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
was going to be really tough

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,759
but actually what we started to see over

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,080
those couple of days

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,440
is the backlog moving pretty quickly

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
across the board

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,199
and into done and we had some great

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,720
moments where we were

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
we're actually having two to three stand

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
ups in a day where we'd have a stand up

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,280
in the morning we'd have a quick stand

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,880
up after lunch just to

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,800
check in and see if the pairs needed to

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,039
switch and who was going to attack

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
which story next we did a stand up at

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,600
the end of the day just to check in

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,759
again around the boards

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,039
um it was really awesome to see it was

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,680
very collaborative

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,240
um but we got to the end of the swarm

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,919
and the team had actually managed to do

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,560
pretty much all of what was in the

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,280
backlog so this was a real campaign that

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
we needed to

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,479
send out and it actually got delivered

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,440
we

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,280
we really did send out this campaign so

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,600
the team felt really awesome

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
we did a fantastic retrospective that

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,720
one of the team members actually

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,440
she t-shaped with me as a scrum master

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,199
and um she delivered a retrospective um

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,960
so sadina you can see her there

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,039
stood with her arms folded and she

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,240
delivered a fantastic retrospective

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
um and the team were really great at

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
understanding

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
that they've developed a load of empathy

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
that they've never had before

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160
you know the struggles that they each

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,759
face um in their roles and actually

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,680
being able to share in that oh i didn't

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,960
realize this system was so clunky to use

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
or i didn't realize you had that

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,080
pressure

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
um from that stakeholder or whatever

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,479
else it was so

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,080
we had a really brilliant reflective

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,440
session and it really did switch the

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,280
mood in the squad

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,639
um in terms of having more empathy and

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
understanding as well as obviously

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
learning a few new skills

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,080
so i was quite proud but there was

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
something that just didn't add up

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,240
because i was a scrum master

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,000
i'm looking at things like velocity um

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,960
love them or hate them we use story

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
points they've worked

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
really well for us um i'm sure i get a

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,240
load of abuse about story points because

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
there's a whole no estimation

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
movement going on but story points work

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,599
for us and they've been good

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,440
so we know our velocity now we took 158

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,400
story points in this little mini

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,599
uh sprint and we took a couple of

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
stories out

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,880
pretty much straight away because we

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,800
realized that we we can actually do them

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,520
um so the 89 represents the amount of

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,080
work that we did versus what we planned

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,440
um

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,639
now 89 by our standards was great we

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,240
normally aim for 80

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,160
or above and i think by most people's

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
standards it's a fantastic result

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
so there was only a couple of things

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,520
that didn't quite make it over the line

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,880
but the mvp was there the epic was

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,680
delivered um

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,720
and we were really happy now i started

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,520
adding up

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
and calculating uh what that meant for

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,120
average

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,319
story points delivered per day now in a

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,000
normal sprint

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
i've got two years of data that shows

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,960
that in an average day

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,599
this squad will deliver about 37 story

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,479
points

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,280
as 37 story points will move into done

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,039
in an average

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,360
sprint day now this same squad

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,960
in the t-shaping days so in these swarm

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,000
days delivered on average

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,080
61 points in a day

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
and i calculated and i calculated and i

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,400
thought i'd made a mistake so i

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,759
calculated again

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,160
but it was accurate they'd actually

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,080
delivered 65 more

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,400
in a day on average during this

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,599
t-shaping sprint than they had

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,599
in a normal sprint and i've got like

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,720
i'll be honest i was really confused and

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,479
it kind of worried me because

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
effectively i was thinking these guys

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,240
are 65

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,440
more productive when they're not even

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
doing their own jobs

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,560
and that really sent me into a bit of a

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,800
panic like we are literally

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,840
proving here that these guys are going

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
to be

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
more effective doing something that

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,279
they've never been trained to do

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
because these guys i was anticipating it

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,080
would be half because you're either

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,320
going to spend your time

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
learning a new skill or teaching someone

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,800
else a skill

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
so in my mind i just thought it's going

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,399
to be roughly half affected but no

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,080
65 more productive when not doing their

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,240
own jobs

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
so we put this back to the team um at

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
the end of the retrospective and

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
actually

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,160
what came out was that the multitasking

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
that this team do

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,440
in a normal sprint um is a real

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,440
detriment

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
now we're normally juggling a few

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,399
different epics there's a few different

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
demands it could be a new

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,160
device launch and we need to send

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,839
marketing out for it it could be

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
a regulatory change and we need to send

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,519
out communications it could be

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,200
ongoing optimization of campaigns that

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,040
we send to customers so there's normally

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
a few different things going on which

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,640
means the squads are often juggling a

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,040
few different epics

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,040
and actually what this mini sprint or

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,000
this swarm enabled the guys to do was

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,800
focus

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,240
on one thing at a time it was one epic

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
everyone in the room regardless of

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,959
whether they were developing the

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
um the content the design for the email

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,800
or whether they were working

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
on um the big data models to figure out

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,160
who we're going to send this

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,360
this campaign to they were all working

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,959
on the same thing so they could shout

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,399
across the room each other ask questions

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,000
and everyone was focused

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
and i don't think i need to explain to a

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,519
room a virtual room full of scrub

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
masters and agile enthusiasts the

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,959
benefits of focusing and doing one thing

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
at a time

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,000
so this was a huge learning not only was

00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,760
there the empathy

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the collaboration the t-shaping very

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,600
practically but there was also this huge

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
revelation for the squad that we need to

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,079
get more

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
focus and actually it shifted the way

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,720
that the team looked at the backlog

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,640
um can we get it down to more of a

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,079
focused backlog can we make sure we

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,399
limit what's in a sprint

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,320
to one or two different epics at tops

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,519
like how can we do that this experiment

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
really proved the point and got them

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,320
thinking differently

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,760
so you might be thinking what can i do

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,680
because not everyone um

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
gets approval to take two or three days

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,720
out with a team and try some wacky

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,399
experiments so

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
but the first thing that i would say is

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,519
experiment and it's easier said than

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,640
done but

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,880
be brave and be bold wherever you can

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,120
take an opportunity to try something new

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,320
we are in a day and age where if we

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,920
don't try new things

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,200
we're just going to fall by the wayside

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,000
and the competition is going to eat us

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,440
up

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
so we need to be bold with our

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,680
experiments as scrum masters

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,640
as agile coaches as agile delivery

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,399
managers

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,519
and we need to get bold with experiments

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,519
i can't recommend it enough

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,800
secondly focus

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,920
oh i've i've nudged the next too long

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,839
okay you're all going to be looking at

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,600
the girl doing her stretches now but

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,959
secondly is focus if you want to win

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,240
five tugs of war with your team and you

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,680
divide up and you eat

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,200
one person in each tug of war you're

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,240
never going to win you need to do one at

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
a time and it's

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,760
it's really the same when we do sprint

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,399
work you need to focus on one thing at a

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,640
time

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,000
get it done get everyone around it it's

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,880
far more efficient and we've

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,760
seen that in our team and thirdly is

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,440
time

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,839
it takes a long time to get comfortable

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,320
running experiments it takes a long time

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
to t-shape it takes a long time to build

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,839
that psychological safety as a team

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
so don't panic thinking that you've got

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,200
to do this all in a day and don't panic

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
thinking just because you

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,040
you know you you run one experiment or

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
one t-shaping session that the team

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,519
haven't quite bought in yet

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560
be patient invest in that team take them

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,240
on a journey

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,000
practice i'm sure this girl probably

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
couldn't do that after a couple of hours

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
i'm sure it's taken her years and

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
i'm going to move along just because

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,120
it's probably freaking some people out

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,000
and finally i'm just going to do a bit

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,519
of a plug really

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
i started a website with a few guys that

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,600
i actually

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,120
worked with at vodafone couple of other

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,920
models cool so

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,240
big up robin cat amy um we were working

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,000
together vodafone we saw agile work

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,839
really well and we decided let's make a

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
website and let's put some great content

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,720
out there to share

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,240
the good stuff that we've seen with

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
other people um

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
so if you grab your phone out and you

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
head to the camera

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,760
and if you point the camera out that qr

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
code it will take you to our

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,279
linkedin page we'd love it if you

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,959
followed us we'd love it if you engage

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,920
with some of our content and

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,800
um and let us know your thoughts on the

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
website

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,360
there is a a much more detailed blog

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
about the extreme t-shaping experiment

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,200
it's got some of the data

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,160
it's got some of the ups and downs and

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
you can read

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,839
more about the extreme t-shaping

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
experiment there

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,279
um love it if you guys get involved love

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,680
it if you uh

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,639
comment on our content and um and let us

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,320
know your thoughts

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,480
i think there's a lot of um

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,639
angst sometimes in the agile community

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,880
and people like to get particular about

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,880
terminology and the agile manifesto

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,639
and actually what we love is just seeing

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,519
a difference in the lives of teams and

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
people because

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,399
agile puts people first and that's

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
fantastic when you've got a team

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,440
that love their culture when you've got

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,399
a team that um

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,000
reflects and they respect each other and

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,360
and their psychological safety it just

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,360
makes work incredible like

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,959
um kind of abdul was saying earlier when

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,079
you've got that culture of looking out

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,839
for one another

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,279
and it just makes all the difference and

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,959
so we really believe in that so we try

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,839
and share content that encourages that

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,519
as well so

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,040
um i'd love to see loads of you guys pop

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,160
up on my phone later following our child

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,519
avengers on linkedin um

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,920
we we post blogs um for scrum masters

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,600
product owners teams organizations

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,959
and we try and share our learnings

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,760
there's a few of us that contribute to

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
the site

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,120
um from in vodafone and outside of

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,120
vodafone um

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,800
and what i find really helpful actually

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
is uh we have a

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,320
section for retrospective ideas so when

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
i was first a scrum master i was always

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,040
scouring the internet for new

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,880
retrospective ideas

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,199
and actually what we tried to build is a

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,199
bit of an archive or a library

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,480
of retrospective ideas that you guys can

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,839
try with your teams

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,560
and there's a few in there that are

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,839
particularly good for remote working so

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,240
they've come out of

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,120
the remote working phase we've been

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,199
through so

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,240
again go through those use some of them

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,880
i'd love to hear your thoughts and

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
feedback

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
on whether they worked or not and how

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,040
they went down with your team

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,639
and then finally i would love to chat

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,079
with you guys i'd love to connect

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
i think it's great when people share

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,440
stuff and share experiments share

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,279
stories

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
share successes failures learning so

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,320
again if you've got your phone out

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,000
scan the qr code it'll just take you

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
through to my linkedin um

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,720
hit connect i'd love to connect with you

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,680
guys i'd love to hear your thoughts and

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,279
feedback

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,199
and again i'd love to see my phone

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,000
popping off with connection requests i

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,000
think it's really good

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
as an agile community we share what's

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
going on um

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,120
so thank you guys for listening um

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,920
appreciate it wasn't fully agile and

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
lockdown

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,839
focused but i hope that it's been

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,519
interesting and i hope that my

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,320
selective use of gifts has given you a

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,320
bit of a smile for a thursday evening

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,480
um john should we do a couple of

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,800
questions

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,480
sure and i'd just like to to stay off

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
i've checked out the agile avengers as

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,880
well

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,639
looked at some content really good and

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
it's it's really useful

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,480
for for people who are just entering the

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,680
the agile world as well

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,920
so yeah really recommend it um

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,600
yeah from i think it'd be good to start

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,920
from from the panelists um

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,320
have any of you guys got a question or

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,959
questions you'd like to ask them

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
yeah let's me again pop it open um so

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,600
yeah i'm

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
i'm really curious actually like how

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,399
this obviously seeing how this works out

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,399
because

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,519
obviously the cliche of d-shaped people

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
is you know you

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,079
need lots of different people and you

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,800
fill up your different bars of your tea

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,120
and stuff like that

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,120
but i've always seen that as being like

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,440
you you hire different types of people

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,880
to

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,880
into your team and you kind of have

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
really diverse hiring and make sure that

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,519
you cover all the bases and you don't

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,399
just have like a load of people that do

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
the same thing

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,079
so i guess it's it's more how how you

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,519
came to the decision to say actually

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,920
well what we're really going to do is

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,040
we're going to ask people to effectively

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,040
step out of their comfort zone which

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,120
obviously isn't for everyone right so

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,160
like whether you've got any resistance

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,759
or

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,279
but also how you kind of came to that

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,600
decision rather than trying to

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,839
maybe make a squad of really mixed

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,160
people

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,560
so i think the thing with t-shaping is

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
that in theory it sounds lovely but in

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,959
practice it's

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
probably never going to happen because

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,000
there's no way that someone can go to

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,279
university and get a master's in big

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,360
data science

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,120
and then come out and be expected to t

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,199
shape with a graphic designer who's just

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,279
been to university and study design

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
and when we're building digital products

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,040
or we're building development products

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,720
often you need those mix of skills and

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,000
if we're going to apply agile to a

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
you know bunch of different companies

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
environments you're going to have those

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,079
different skills so

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,240
i think for us it was less about can we

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,199
you know do t-shaping in its purest

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,720
fashion

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
but more can we get a bit more of an

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,520
understanding and a bit more empathy

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,439
so that when we're building a product or

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
we're looking at a new campaign

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,640
even though you've got two very

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,240
different skill sets when we're starting

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,839
those planning sessions

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
the big data scientists can have some

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,039
empathy with the designer when it comes

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,319
to scoping out what the campaign's going

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
to look like and actually there's more

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,880
of a

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,839
fluid conversation the whole way through

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,280
rather than

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,440
i'm only going to pay attention when

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,640
it's the you know the design part or i'm

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,000
only going to pay attention when it's

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,039
the commercial

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,640
aspect of this build so um that was kind

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,320
of how we viewed it we've recognized

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,559
we're never going to hire

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,120
completely t-shaped individuals but it

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,640
was about the empathy the collaboration

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
and i think we've been looking and

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,280
trying to develop and the right

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,840
attitudes in our

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,280
in our teams that if you want to come in

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,080
and just sit in a corner and do your own

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,360
thing

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,559
you're probably not going to fit here

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,160
because we want people who are

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,320
collaborative we want people who are up

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,440
to learning new things and so that's

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,240
kind of been our approach

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
is that helpful yeah it makes sense yeah

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
can i just

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,520
i'll probably just not question but

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,400
supporting statement to that is um

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,559
it's when i did you find that people

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,280
were just genuinely interested

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,720
in a new area right we've seen that too

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,400
and if they're interested

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,760
they want to learn and they want to take

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,039
on micro tasks

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,960
which means if someone wants to go on

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,240
holiday or someone gets sick during

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,520
covid for example

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,520
you've got that stuff is that the kind

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,760
of what were the kind of i'd like to

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,280
almost know the wow moments when they

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,400
started you had those two guys sitting

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,400
at the front of the table

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,480
do you have any quotes or any eureka

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,600
moments you could share as well

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,360
i think the wow moments i'm just going

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,080
to go back to this slide

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,200
because i think this this probably shows

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,559
it here

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,240
so basically the retrospective we did

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,600
we divided up a big piece of poster

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,360
chart into four

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,520
got the guys to do self portraits for a

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,919
bit of a laugh just to change things up

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,200
and each section was something different

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,039
so it was learn

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,160
change and i think it was surprised and

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,840
recommend so everyone moved around

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,360
and they added in some comments to each

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
other's posters what did i learn about

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,640
your role

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,360
um what would i change about your role

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
what would i

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,679
what surprised me about your role what

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,840
would i recommend and so there was just

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,440
so many eureka moments of like i never

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,360
realized that that system

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,039
was so difficult and that took so long

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,000
to do i wouldn't put so much pressure on

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,840
you if i don't know

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,120
that that thing crashes every half an

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,640
hour you know is the only way i can help

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,160
you is there anything i can do

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,080
to make your life easier along that

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
process that for me

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,840
i think and for the team was probably

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,320
the biggest thing it was the empathy

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,440
and since then there's just been so much

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,480
less tension

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,039
and such more a collaborative um way of

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,400
working

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,840
so i think that was it as honestly

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
that's worth its weight in gold when

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,120
you've got a

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,080
the external climate being like it is

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,000
right and um

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,440
i think it's for all of us something if

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,960
you could add that as an exp or you've

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,720
got an experiment on your website

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,640
i think we all want to try that a little

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,120
bit hopefully most of us are like

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,559
let's try this so people can take a page

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,039
out of dale carnegie's book and say

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,200
right

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,559
how do other people actually feel and

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,520
what's it what's what are they going

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,440
through right

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,080
yeah 100 yeah

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,360
um we just got a few questions from from

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,000
the um

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
audience um so ali asks do you think

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,640
t-shirt

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:32,159
t-shaping would work remotely too

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:35,200
well that's a great question yes

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,960
might be trickier because we're already

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,880
staring at screens a lot and to stare at

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,159
a screen for longer to learn

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,400
someone else's role is going to be

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,679
tricky but absolutely i think you can

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,480
still encourage

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,280
people to collaborate more um in a

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,440
similar way

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,120
what we've ended up with is two people

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,799
sat around one laptop one person's

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,960
teaching the other person's learning

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,640
that doesn't feel very efficient because

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,919
you think well if you just did your job

00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,679
and i did mine

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,280
then we probably get more done but

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,840
actually you have to put an investment

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,200
in to get a long-term benefit

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,960
and that's going to be the same whether

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,320
we're remote or not so if we're remote

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,520
and two people want a t-shape they're

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,200
going to have to block some time out

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,200
where one person is teaching

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,400
and the other person is learning and

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
that's going to be tough

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,400
either way so i definitely still think

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,640
you can do it in terms of facilitating

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,520
an activity or a session like that

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,679
you're gonna have to get a bit more

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,640
creative use a tool like mural which

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,919
uh abdo was demonstrating earlier um but

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
you can definitely still do it it just

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,600
requires that bravery

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,320
for the the initial investment in some

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,840
time

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,720
to get a longer term benefit cool and

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,200
very last question um from from dina um

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,640
she

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,760
asked any idea how we can try t-shaping

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,159
for dev teams

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,559
where you have b fe and test engineers

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
well dina that's a tough one i've not

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,720
actually worked with

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,720
pure dev teams i've been working with

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,320
business teams commercial teams

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,080
and so i probably wouldn't be best

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,600
placed to answer that question actually

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,240
i don't know if jason or abdul has got

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
any thoughts

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,039
um i think from my perspective and i

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,440
actually put it in the chat as well

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,280
and it's obviously really common for

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,039
there to be people that have specialisms

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,720
in certain areas because of course

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,880
you know they they've learned a certain

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,480
uh certain stack and they they've

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,360
they've really specialized in that stack

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,880
and that's really

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,400
really beneficial because it means that

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,720
people can

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,760
do really cool work in those areas but i

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,360
guess

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,440
where i see it it's maybe just a second

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,799
level of tea or some other letter or

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,440
something like that but like

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,799
the the fact that you want to avoid

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,720
handoffs in

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,799
any kind of sort of agile development

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,679
because any a handoff is going to

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,960
cause some kind of delay effectively

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,440
because you're waiting for someone else

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
to take

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,960
a thing on so i think the thing that i

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,200
would really advocate myself is um

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,880
that front end developers learn some

00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,679
back end development they don't have to

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,120
be like

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,240
all of a sudden like the best data

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,919
engineer in the world or something like

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,200
that but that they have some kind of

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,640
knowledge that they can

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,960
use to to tie the front end to the back

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
end

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,320
and vice versa because from my

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,679
perspective the fewer handoffs you can

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,960
have in your development process the

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,360
quicker that process is going to be

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,919
because

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,120
you don't have the kind of the overload

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,320
of having to keep passing stuff

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
backwards and forwards and waiting for

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,799
people to

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,240
be available just fix it yourself it's

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,280
tough because people don't always have

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,200
that

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,559
uh mindset or they don't have the skills

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,280
in those areas or

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,679
maybe you're using this a a library or a

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,080
platform or a language that's just

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,159
different but it just feels really

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,440
it's almost like a sub t of the big t

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,360
you mean i still think that people

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,960
should have business scents new accents

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
and customer sense all that other sense

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
but

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,360
just having that kind of micro sense of

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,880
well different types of the same

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,919
bit of the tea so different types of

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,760
development is really useful

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,200
yeah i just want to build on that really

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,720
quickly um

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,279
we just get our devs to shadow each

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,440
other and call tasks

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,520
and what we tend to do is we give them a

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,120
task just like ben was doing as well

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,559
um it's usually when you release a

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,320
product so

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,159
sometimes when you have a vendor that

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,360
will have a specific skill set

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,679
and we have an internal team that

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,240
doesn't have it a lot of us call it

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,320
knowledge transfer but uh we

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,840
specifically give tasks in order to

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,440
create the knowledge transfer through

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,159
practical experience

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,440
um and also we try to i think we we're

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,640
stepping a bit away from

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,240
terminology like front-end back-end um

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,720
we like this we i use this term

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
personally called unicorn individuals

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,039
where you have a broad-based

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,480
understanding of for example

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,000
object-orientated code

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,480
but then a basis of um design design

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,240
understanding a front-end so if you can

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,039
try to cultivate more of that mindset

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,559
through practical experience and through

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,120
just putting them on some courses as

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,480
well

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,080
i think that will benefit the team

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,039
because then you sometimes only need one

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,039
person

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,320
versus needing two sets of developers

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,320
and we've seen that work well actually

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,360
well thank you very much thanks a lot

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,039
ben for the for the talking some really

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,279
interesting questions there and some

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,640
really interesting discussions um so

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,200
pleasure thanks john

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,200
