Title: The Future of Work - Agile Roundabout - June 2020
Publication date: 2020-06-30
Playlist: Agile Roundabout
Description: 
	This talk was delivered by Robert Ord for a live webinar with Agile Roundabout

In the current environment of distributed working and social lockdown, it is hard to remember and maintain the principles of agile that we use un our daily roles.

This talk reflects on the habits, behaviours and connections we make with colleagues and makes practical suggestions for how we can nurture and grow our relationship.

Health and wellbeing is of paramount importance, particularly now as we face a new normal for modern delivery

yeah thank you to to Bethel and the team

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,099
for inviting me to talk again it's a

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,320
privilege to come and support this group

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,599
so thank you very much for that for

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,820
those of you who were around for the

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,710
last book that I did I did the very

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,630
dangerous move of brewing in my existing

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,789
client who pays my bills on to the stage

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,990
of me risking getting fired giving me

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,510
insights for what was actually happening

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,380
on the ground and it was a case study on

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,849
scaled agile in reality I think the

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,130
interesting aspect it was it was a

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,170
completely business context with very

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,000
little technology input so it's how we

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,370
were applying the frameworks to fit

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,770
within that model the reason I'm saying

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,870
this is the the final part of the talk

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,809
was on the effect that this change was

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,370
having two individuals in the team

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:50,250
though both are an individual psychology

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,989
level and also how the dynamics between

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,239
their teams were beginning to form and

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,239
reform and they weren't used to working

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,920
in groups particularly they absolutely

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,719
were used to working from a common

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,449
backlog it was a very siloed and

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,339
distributed organization so what I

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,260
wanted to do today really is is pick up

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,619
again on that topic because it got the

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,610
most traction on LinkedIn afterwards and

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,650
there was a number of spin-off

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,240
conversation that came from it and just

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,920
focused really on observations I've had

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,680
in the last few months since we did that

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,780
talk on the impact that coronavirus has

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,880
had now that we're all distributed in

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,560
particular and some of the learnings

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,270
i've seen come through not modulus from

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,130
my main client but from across the

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,860
client base that i regularly talk to a

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,880
Catco about making agile work in a

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,200
distributed context so I thought I'd

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,259
start off with a nice statistic for a

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,790
McKinsey which is 62% of executives

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,320
believe they will need to retrain or

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,530
replace more than a quarter of their

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,270
workforce between now and 2020 three

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,680
have you used this quite a few times in

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,600
a number of client pitches if I spoken

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,270
to and it absolutely frightens the life

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,450
out of most of the execs that I get time

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,610
with the it's not just the thought of

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,990
losing some other workforce and you know

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,579
we're all used to colleagues coming and

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,079
going depending on their desires and

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,000
what they're interested in doing but I

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,000
think what's particularly staggering

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,860
about this is the sheer volume of people

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,350
that will have to be retrained as well

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,140
as having to be replaced so we

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,270
we know that working according to the

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,400
Scranton book or to whichever I'll frame

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,310
what we take as a prescribed methodology

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,630
for that but I'm hoping that this most

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,150
of you will resonate also with the

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,800
sentiment that the majority of the time

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,950
taking the book and applying it doesn't

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
work and you have to make allowances for

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,010
specific cultures within the

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,070
organization how people are the dynamics

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,510
between them some of the Q&A questions I

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,160
was just answering then you know it

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,230
could be constraints at the organization

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,760
for how you work and making sure that

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,640
you've still got some autonomy and

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,200
flexibility there is a continual

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,170
learning path in the field that we

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,870
operate in and I think the key thing

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,340
then is this is testament that executive

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,590
is starting to take note that the way

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,330
that we operate as a group is in effect

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,160
the new normal and the majority of the

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,160
organization has to be prepared for it

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,110
some of the challenges that we've seen

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,700
come through there's a good report for

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,050
state of remote working as the race for

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,850
the state of DevOps report state of

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,200
agile reports so if you if you get a few

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,480
minutes I'd absolutely recommend having

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,150
a read through some of these what I find

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,250
particularly interesting I guess and

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,440
surprising for this is if I look at some

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,960
of the some of the elements that would

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,880
probably true pre coronavirus know

00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,640
taking vacation time maybe working in

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,960
different time zones stayed motivated

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,130
they were probably the key factors that

00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,830
were being pulled out prior to

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,630
coronaviruses the main challenges of

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,970
remote working which is facing the jobs

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,090
will stop what has become more apparent

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,220
since then is the the whopping 23% that

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,470
prioritize unplugging from work all the

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,940
20% let's say loneliness you know you

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,470
add those together you're talking almost

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,830
half of the people who respond to the

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,940
survey are finding it a challenge

00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,320
balancing their work life with their

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,290
home life in this current environment

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,970
and who knows when it's going to end

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,290
while it was becoming a topic of

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,000
interest to talk about personal

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,370
well-being and mental health prior to

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,920
coronavirus I think we need to do more

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,450
very very quickly to accept the fact

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,100
that people are struggling right now and

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,520
it's not it's not an easy way to work

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,290
and as practitioners of various

00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,790
different agile theories we are

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,290
absolutely the best place to help people

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,370
make a change and give them the support

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,370
they're going to need from it

00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:29,979
so there are three elements I wanted to

00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,539
talk through on this today the first one

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,699
is building culture in connection with

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:35,289
your team the second one is how you can

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,210
sound commitment to yourself and to your

00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:38,800
team into actual habits and then the

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,229
final one is just a little perspective

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,139
on katka what we're seeing is the key

00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:48,460
dimensions for the future of all look so

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:51,069
culture and connection communication we

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,539
know is absolutely vital important for

00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,860
those of you who ever done any analysis

00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,479
on this you'll also know that the

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,680
majority of communication happens

00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,930
through body language I think it's

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,000
somewhere around seven six to 75 percent

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,300
is usually the figure that people take

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,800
well we've got video conferences and you

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,180
can see people space and you can see

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,250
their empathy without having sometimes

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,740
it's very difficult to do that on scale

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,150
so if I just compare now for example how

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,949
I'm doing this towards you today I'm

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,449
looking at my screen little green dark

00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,280
on my iMac which is where the camera is

00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,630
this time last year when I was doing

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,460
this walk I had a hundred and twenty

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,169
people in front of me I could scan the

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,550
room I could see your interests see when

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,379
you're yawning see if you're stretching

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,360
see if you're engaged by something else

00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,009
and it's that element of communication

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,539
that we've we were beginning to lose

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:34,000
because the environment that we're in

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,620
the long-term and thanks to that are yet

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,889
to be seen I'm sure there'll be some

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,840
wider societal impacts from that but for

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,159
the time being the key thing here is

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,990
that we still need to be able to build

00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,130
trust with people whether that's a new

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,900
team that we've only just started

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,779
working with or whether it's rebuilding

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,219
trust between members who maybe we're

00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:52,270
starting to lose a bit of touch with

00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:54,460
them because of the day-to-day

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,060
interactions being lost it could be your

00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,650
manager

00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,029
doesn't trust you to crack on with a

00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,830
worker now to provide extensive

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,229
visibility over all the stories that

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,580
you're working on every single day so

00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,529
three tips that we found that work

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,330
particularly well is practice real

00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:09,039
empathy so again I'm sure you would have

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,319
heard this before in many many training

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,690
sessions it's not rocket science when

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,599
someone talks to you listen to what they

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,210
are saying actually take in the words

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,250
they use the tone they are using what

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,349
they are saying whether it's clear if

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,610
they're fumbling through it is it a hard

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,919
message they're trying to give you is it

00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,330
a happy message we really listen to what

00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,180
they're saying and use that as the the

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,399
hug for engagement with them to be

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,139
proactive in the way that you ask people

00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,570
how they're doing you know it is typical

00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,289
as the British people when you start a

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,669
conversation

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,529
you ask how was your weekend wasn't

00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,779
weather good that might be sufficient

00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,009
for a face-to-face conversation but when

00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,990
you are engaging with people in this

00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,550
remote environment try and explore a

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,659
little more know you know if you know

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,770
something a little bit about them

00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,300
whether it's you know they have a

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,069
particular favorite sport they don't

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,749
like to do rather than saying didn't you

00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,999
enjoy the weather ask them you know did

00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:00,550
you enjoy you know practicing basketball

00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,020
the weekend something like that show an

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,809
interest in who they are as individual

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,879
and then finally and this one trophy

00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:10,240
absolutely nuts is you do not have to be

00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,219
formal all the time the number of client

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,680
pitches I've done for extremely large

00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:16,240
deals where the resonating feedback

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,520
across all the different consultancies

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,649
is simply you were too formal in how you

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,050
went about your approach remember that

00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:26,619
even if the situation dictates certain

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,749
levels of I suppose decorum for the

00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:30,639
meeting that you're in you are still

00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:33,309
talking to human beings and human beings

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,139
respond to other human beings so find

00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:36,430
out balance between formally informal to

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:41,379
really build the trust for the people

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:43,180
you're talking to the next big bucket of

00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:46,149
challenge that we tend to see is

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,879
productivity in the work environment it

00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,620
is an absolute privilege actually to see

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,939
people on conference calls when they're

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,349
actually within their own home you get

00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:55,360
to learn something about our people and

00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,789
I've chosen the white background today

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,769
just because that's my preferred style

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,479
when I do presentations but when this is

00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:02,889
not here you'll see behind me and a

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,169
library full of different signed by

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,969
books and I don't mind people seeing

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,649
that when I'm in smaller were

00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:10,209
conversations' but it lets them know

00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,949
something about me and it always strikes

00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:14,110
up a conversation with them about Who I

00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,639
am I'm looking enough and fortunate

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,289
enough to be able to do that in my

00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,479
little office and I have my own desk in

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,819
reserved area and that's what I need to

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,639
help me be focused in what I do my own

00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,779
little quiet space that I go to I

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,639
recognize at the same time that's not

00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:30,189
the same for everybody else some people

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,479
prefer to have you know working spaces

00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:33,069
in the kitchens they might be in shared

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,899
houses though suppose you've got

00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:36,550
childcare you will have children running

00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:38,680
around who will answer all your meetings

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,329
or bang on the door you might have pets

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,529
you might be back in the office and be

00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:42,759
the only person there it is you know

00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:46,149
your voice is becoming around the

00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:48,910
corridor there is a variety of spaces

00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:50,470
that people choose to work in and the

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,649
point behind this is you need to find

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,180
the environment that helps

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,920
would make a real change to keep that

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,699
sustainable that you're able to work

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,439
productively there are a variety of

00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,910
methods be able to do this one little

00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,819
one with a third of which is quite cool

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,290
as the Pomodoro Technique and basically

00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:07,819
it's setting yourself a rhythm in a

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,769
pattern where you have a focus a bit at

00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:12,019
a time that you work on something you

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:13,699
take a short break you focus again take

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,439
a short break you focus again and then

00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:18,079
you have a longer break so it breaks

00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:19,579
down your daily work routine either into

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,050
the you know the smaller stories that

00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:22,910
you've got or whether it's something

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,179
bigger it keeps you ticking over on a

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,889
nice pan my biggest flaw with working is

00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,269
I just forget to take breaks because I

00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,579
get so engrossed and involved in what

00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,170
I'm doing and I have to consciously set

00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:36,399
myself timers on my phone to say you

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,399
need to take a screen break

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,819
self-care is equally important again I

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,069
prefer to play music when I'm working I

00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:46,600
don't want interruptions but depending

00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:47,949
on the type of work I'm doing allowed to

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,540
put are having a metal track on or

00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:51,250
sometimes I'll put some classical music

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,829
on and both of them help me thinking

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,120
concentrate in different ways I will

00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:57,069
always get dressed for the day in the

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,779
morning for work and I'll never do it in

00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:00,459
pajamas because Timothy that needs to be

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,279
a step change away from my home life to

00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:04,509
my work like when I come in the office I

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,310
know a lot of people who are much more

00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:08,019
active than me and they take great pride

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,579
in that and they they block out their

00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,519
calendar and there are refusing to do

00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:13,990
meetings before 8:30 and whilst most of

00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,839
us could probably do earlier because the

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,550
can you have gone and I admire them for

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,139
what they do to ring-fence that time the

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,649
diary to say that this is me and what I

00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:22,649
have to do

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,270
there's a lot of ideas here for things

00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,240
that you can do with people to show them

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,890
around I haven't seen all these happen

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,440
but I've seen recipe dares happen on

00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,180
some of my clients sites the MTV Cribs

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,010
style video Tori's a particularly good

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,070
one if you're in a safe team that can

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,870
always be a nice thing to do the chat

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,400
channel with pictures of pets has

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,330
actually been a resounding success from

00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,680
the client account of see might use them

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,920
get wonderful pets that people had that

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,390
I just had never idea you would do I'm

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,920
but I guess the point is if you think

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,400
about who you are as a person how you

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,520
want to reflect that into your work life

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,480
I'm not saying that you have to be 100%

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,180
individual and personable and everything

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,710
you do but it's not a problem to let a

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,870
bit of your true personality and

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,820
character show

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,290
stoat it's all well and good saying that

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,050
but I suppose the challenge is how do

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,279
you actually make it stick and turn

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,510
ideas and interested into a hobby that

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,330
actually makes you work better

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,890
um I've borrowed this wonderful formula

00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,810
from a colleague of mine called there

00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,420
Casey Shafer in the US who does

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,430
excellent presentations on this topic so

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,020
if we think about big things that we

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,190
have to change like it you know I want

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,110
to learn a new language and move to

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,850
France and that is a big goal that is

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,680
unlikely to happen tomorrow

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,690
but what you can do is to make tiny

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,970
habit changes and behavior changes today

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,459
which will stick for tomorrow a lot of

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,660
this is rooted in deep theory to give

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,510
you an example of something that I've

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,100
done for myself with this so behaviors

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,230
are essentially built of three

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,390
components as the motivation to want to

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,430
do something there's the actual ability

00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,050
to be able to do it and then there's a

00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,800
trigger or event that gives you the

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:04,500
impetus to go up and do it so for me as

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,880
I just mentioned with reading I rarely

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,990
get a chance to read at the moment

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,730
because when I get back from work and

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,980
exhausted and I just want to with the

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,959
kids to bed and then go to sleep so I

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,520
have a motivation still because there's

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,620
nothing I like more than going into a

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,660
classic sci-fi novel and they're reading

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,100
the whole thing cover to cover and I

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,839
know I've got the ability to do it I

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,040
might be the best and quickest read in

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,900
the world but I'm able to go through a

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,520
couple of chapters a day but the

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,930
challenge for me was the trigger and

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,850
finding that moment where I would

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,560
actually sit down and do the reading so

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,010
one of the tiny habit changes I changed

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,720
myself my usual routine would be as I

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,400
said come home play with the kids back

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,709
time bedtime and then usually about by

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,150
8:30 and maybe 8 o'clock and I'll be

00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:44,130
able to come downstairs and that's kind

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,540
of Monday finished and I'll always go to

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,820
the capital to make myself a tea or a

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,230
coffee so what I've started doing is

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,700
rather than making that and particularly

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,320
back to the lounge where else to sit

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,670
down and washing thing on TV I've put

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,709
the book that I want to read next to the

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,450
kettle so that when I go make myself

00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,040
that tea as part of my routine my

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,290
trigger is in front of me and I'm like

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,940
okay I'm gonna have a half an hour or an

00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,500
hour window I'm gonna take my book and

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,970
I'm going to read it and just making

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,430
like a slight change to my environment

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,890
and where my things are has let me take

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,930
on this new behavior I would encourage

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,970
you all to think about what that is

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,350
where there is no I drink too many beers

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,029
in the evenings so if that's the case

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,020
take away the coffee table next to yours

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,540
to eat and then you've got nowhere to

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,240
put your cup it is the exercise routine

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,220
and were

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,810
hanging out at 6:30 mind isn't work for

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,399
you you make a note to do it at

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,690
lunchtime you know find the time or

00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,500
something that's going to help you do

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,500
what you want to do

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,089
couple of small ideas there I wouldn't

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:40,410
recommend the ice-cream so that's going

00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:43,259
to help any was in the moment so just to

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,579
wrap it all together from a consulting

00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:46,230
perspective and the majority of work

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,290
that I do dates today is advising

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,880
clients on usually taking small agile

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,380
proof of concepts and working out how

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,360
they can scale that across the business

00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,610
using whichever framework is going to be

00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,180
scale might offering work Spotify less

00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,100
Dada

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,670
you name it it always tends to be a

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,170
blend of it but broadly through the team

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,660
chats of how recently there are these

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:10,529
four buckets that people are thinking

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,910
about for the future of work and the

00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,910
first one is the way of working that

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,410
people actually have lucky I thought it

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,029
was just fascinating listening to your

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,250
talk before about how you made your

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,779
agile team work and function and you

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,149
know the way that you operated in terms

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,440
to lift elements of the agile book and

00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:27,120
adding your own elements to make it

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,610
successful for your context that is

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,680
exactly what this is about find a way

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,569
that works for you in your team even if

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,980
it's slightly against the grain if it

00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,630
works for you go ahead and do it because

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,889
you're going to produce more value and

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:39,560
you're going to step further ahead by

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,910
doing it that way

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,430
fickle space I know we've talked a lot

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,779
about person and environment today but

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,029
if we think more holistically about

00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,250
office buildings for example we could

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:51,750
start to reimagine the way our this

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,610
space is used so if we move away from

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,889
hot desks and just having a co-located

00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,930
team I've heard an increasing number of

00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,329
clients talk about having a single

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,040
collaboration space where people will go

00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:04,529
into London or whichever city is gonna

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,850
divvy to do work together and aside from

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,769
that you have they work from anywhere

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,360
time mantra so we really lose some

00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:11,699
significant changes to the way that our

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,620
offices are laid out as far as

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:15,120
technology is concerned a lot of

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,920
technology to pieces but when it comes

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,180
to doing this kind of work I'm unsure it

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,100
tends to be big that's all I mean that

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,920
works and just get it on as possible I

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,170
get frustrated by hanging on technology

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,670
as the conversation points because to me

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,060
it's an enabler it's not the end of the

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,920
conversation so my steer on this is take

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,870
the tooling that you need to be able to

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,459
fill your job try and make that a

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,750
standard pattern across your team so

00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,300
you're all working from the same hymn

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,010
sheet let them move forward and of

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,329
course the final one is the one that we

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,069
spend a significant amount of time

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:45,089
talking to today and this is about the

00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,069
people within your team

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,199
think about what it's like working with

00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:51,329
it today what you can do to change to

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,949
really lift up people's moods start to

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:55,079
spot and even understand where they are

00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:57,959
at the moment and then as we look to the

00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,379
future and hopefully you know reuniting

00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:03,269
with colleagues across the world in in

00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:04,529
not to disturb you for anyway let's

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,910
think about what that relationship is

00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,529
going to look like in the future and

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,999
undoubtedly things are going to change

00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:10,439
and you might not feel comfortable going

00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,759
up and giving that person a hug anymore

00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:13,529
but you would have done on a Monday

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,209
morning what is the other thing you

00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:17,189
could do you know could you bring them a

00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,569
coffee from pret and leave it on the

00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:20,819
side just to show your token of

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:24,720
appreciation to say is good to see you

00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:27,050
again thank you very much for listening

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,050
today

00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:35,930
thank you very much Rob does anybody

00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:38,449
quickly before you move on does anybody

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:42,370
have any questions do any of the other

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:45,769
panelists have any questions for Rob oh

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,720
yeah I actually have a question for you

00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,160
around this because I think it's very I

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,470
think it's very important and very

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,110
relevant to talk about what's the future

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,129
of how things are gonna look and and I

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,540
think some things will fundamentally

00:16:55,129 --> 00:17:02,420
change how have you ever had any

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:06,230
experience with everything being remoted

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:09,350
online recently with getting that kind

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,579
of magical aha moment when people are

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,140
kind of together when they're like

00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,520
working on a whiteboard together if you

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,409
remember back in the day we were in the

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,709
office people would work on a whiteboard

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:20,709
together and you'd see that interaction

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:23,659
happening have you in your experience

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,909
managed to see or facilitate that same

00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:29,360
kind of feeling happening with everybody

00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:31,520
being remote yeah it is absolutely hard

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,710
it's gets that point but getting that

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,120
aha moment in workshops is actually key

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,490
to the job that I do good day today I

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,260
think the most successful set up I've

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,669
done for this and this you know speech

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,649
the tool you think I just said before

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,899
the one I tend to use is one called

00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:46,640
mural so it's quite cool to be able to

00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:48,559
jump in jump out and around this big

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,360
canvas so you can take people's thoughts

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,280
here there and everywhere what a lot

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,260
about it in particular is you can you

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,580
can basically partition the topics that

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,049
you want to talk to people about them

00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,880
and we always include something which is

00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,289
you know your thoughts - your feelings

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,419
are something that's resonating with you

00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,309
as you go through so if you have like a

00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:07,070
jewel hat facilitator co facilitator

00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:08,780
role co facilitator can constantly keep

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,100
on top of the comments people making

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,630
about what's resonating and you can

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,340
adjust the conversation on the fly and

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,020
constantly John some things that people

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,850
want to know about so if you're a little

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,110
bit more sensitive to the mood in the

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,720
room and what people want to talk about

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,780
it it tends to be either together I open

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,730
my mind okay that's an interesting one

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,740
we literally here at the zone we just

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,500
started trialing we started a trial of

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,159
mural today so yeah I'll give that a try

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:38,390
yeah thanks I don't work from Europe

00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:41,590
otherwise I might be other way not mural

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,590
and not the White Sox either

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,130
