thank you so much and yet you got the

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:08,069
zone right very often some people say

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,230
daisen or Dodson as my father calls it

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,059
but yep the zone the zone

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,490
so thanks thanks good for being here I

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,800
think I think I was at agile round about

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,690
this time last year or maybe yeah

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,970
sometime around this time last year so

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,670
I'm very humbled and honored that you

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,900
guys invited me back so you can endure

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,900
more punishment

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,290
so yeah just a quick little thing about

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:37,950
me so my name is jonathan lucky yep my

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,750
last name is lucky that is my surname if

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,180
you can't tell I'm from the United

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,610
States I grew up in a little city

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,739
actually a big city called Cincinnati

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,930
Ohio so find it on a map it's a it's an

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,210
interesting place where it is for the

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,469
last 10 years I've been working in both

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,160
business-to-business and

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,559
business-to-consumer software I've been

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,619
involved in a wide variety of roles

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,520
ranging from sales to marketing product

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,920
marketing product management and in my

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,210
current iteration of my life I am an

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,880
agile coach so very exciting stuff over

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,430
the years and about two years ago I I've

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,259
been with his own for about five years I

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,409
transferred here about two years ago

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,970
from our offices in Charlotte I'm a

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,000
quick thing about the zone if you don't

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,579
know what the zone is it's we are a live

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,430
sports streaming platform where we

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,740
stream a variety of live sports all over

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,689
the world so we're in several countries

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,840
around the world right now including

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,829
Germany Austria Switzerland Spain Brazil

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,020
the United States Canada Japan so forth

00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:51,329
and our goal is later on this year we'll

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,030
be launching globally so don't be

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,369
surprised if you start seeing the zone

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,579
or you start watching the zone locally

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,070
here in the UK so very exciting to work

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,820
in sports and we're very excited to see

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,929
sports coming back safely this year or

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,760
relatively soon all right so let's jump

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,980
right in one of the things is we're

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,040
talking about the theme of two

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,400
being agnostic agile and you're probably

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,879
doing it already one of the things that

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,890
got me thinking about is about when we

00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,390
often think about framework or think

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,390
about agile we're thinking about the

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:35,160
practices so the frameworks scrum Kanban

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:38,640
XP programmer anarchy safe Nexus scrum

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,959
at scale whatever and one of the things

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,170
I got to think about as I was preparing

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,920
this presentation is that in reality we

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,709
could follow every single rule in all of

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,980
these frameworks we could enforce every

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,760
single practice we could have the best

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,099
daily stand-ups we could have the best

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,540
sprint planning meetings we could have a

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:05,370
really cool-looking well grained backlog

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,069
we could have the very best cycle times

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,680
we could be increasing our velocity a

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:12,450
hundred percent sprint over sprint we

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,390
could be hitting every single deadline

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,549
every day exceed all of our okrs

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,130
objectives and key results for those of

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:23,190
you who don't know what those are beat

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:28,290
every ache every KPI meet every standard

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:31,019
and yet still fail to generate frequent

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,169
value to the customer in a creative

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,870
collaborative environment so that's not

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,849
to say that the stuff above is not

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,280
important I have meetings about this

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,650
stuff all the time but we always have to

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,989
maintain a perspective that this stuff

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,239
all of the the frameworks and the rules

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,549
and all that stuff all those things are

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,160
supposed to serve our primary objective

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,230
which is generating value frequently to

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,540
the customer and how do we how do we

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,489
sustain generating that value frequently

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,290
to the customer it's through having a

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,260
creative collaborative environment and

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,030
so that's really really key sometimes we

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,549
get really caught up in the processes

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,169
and the procedures and stuff we're

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,230
really we need to have our eye on the

00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:16,079
ball which is generating that value to

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,320
the customer so I figured I'd share

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,620
three stories in my experience in

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,810
software development across my career

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,320
that might kind that at least for me

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:32,790
gave me a glimpse of

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,220
what like that really core bit of what

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:39,990
agility is about you know not just

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:42,449
following scrum exactly not just doing

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,000
having nice continuous flow on a Kanban

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,160
board but really that yeah we're really

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,860
hitting that core of what agility is

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,600
meant for to to a team and to a business

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,000
so the first story I want to talk about

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,330
is from a story a very from very early

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,510
in my a Jelani and I and this time I

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:08,250
worked for a company that was a business

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:12,030
intelligence and reporting software

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,250
company so enterprise software and for

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,770
much of the time there the way we built

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,320
software we we really believed we were

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,020
an agile company where some companies

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,419
are on one end of the extreme where they

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,789
have all they have every single bit of

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:29,910
agile bureaucracy that you can think of

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:31,860
from ever having like really really like

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,229
every single kind of meeting refinements

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,200
pre refinements and three amigos and two

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:40,080
amigos and release trains and all this

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,060
stuff we were actually on the other end

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,830
of the extreme where we said we're agile

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,030
so we don't have we're not gonna have

00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,410
meetings even though we're having a

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,960
meeting in this video later on this is

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,240
when we started doing working on our

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,940
agile transformation we sit over agile

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,990
we're not gonna have meetings oh you

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,610
know we're not supposed to bother

00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,800
developers so we'll just give the

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,330
developers you know this vague thing and

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,310
then we'll just kind of let them run

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,900
with it for six months and then we'll

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,180
come back and see what they came up with

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,270
and that's what we thought

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,880
agility was and when we weren't getting

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,750
the results as a business that we wanted

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,940
the engineers weren't happy and we said

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,870
you know we need to make a change and so

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:26,310
we had a photo quote proper agile

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,970
transformation we decided to do scrum

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:33,510
and but we wanted to approach scrum a

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:36,330
little different from how everyone

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,840
traditionally performed scrum and we all

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,659
do this

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,250
my team's do this even today your does

00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:43,470
your sprint plan and go a little bit

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,390
this you look at what the tickets that

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,880
are at the top of your backlog you guys

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:50,460
go okay what do we need to get done you

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,850
drag in the tickets into the sprint and

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,130
JIRA and you go okay guys is this too

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,410
much work can we handle this what else

00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,850
have you got to get done all right I'll

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,860
be happy with all the work that's in the

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,270
sprint is everybody busy does everybody

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,550
have something to work on

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,380
you know that's kind of how you know you

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,000
that's how sprint planning works right

00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,610
and then everybody nods and you could

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,410
hit click start and then go off you go

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,450
on your sprint the engineers pick their

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,980
little pick their individual tasks right

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,950
out of the board and then off they go to

00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,530
do their work we wanted to approach it

00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:25,440
differently from that so what we did is

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,530
we said we're going to just pick one

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,100
user story from the top of our backlog

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,710
just one user story and the entire team

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,010
is going to focus and work on that one

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,040
user story for the Sprint that's it just

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,930
one just one user story for the Sprint

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,180
and what we did is we said instead of

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,550
saying let's try and get all of the

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,430
checklist done that's in the acceptance

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,770
criteria of our user story we said well

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,410
we want to look at that user story and

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,720
say what is the smallest version of that

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,470
story we could potentially deliver

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,790
within two weeks I think in this case I

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,390
think we grant two and a half weeks for

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:09,090
it so we did that and then the team

00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,700
worked on just that story together all

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,169
day long so in some cases they mob

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,970
thought they did some mob and pair

00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,160
programming on those things in other

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,990
cases they kind of broke down st. broke

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,580
down aspects of that story and they said

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,950
hey I'll do I'll take the data layer

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,880
okay cool I'll work on the styling

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,520
whatever by the end of the Sprint we

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,110
also approached the Sprint review

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,630
differently from what a lot of companies

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,390
do so a lot of companies typically you

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,710
review your sprint review ends up being

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:44,820
a demo to your product owner or it tends

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:46,440
to be a demo to stakeholders and that's

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,530
usually what we always do because the

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,630
customer is not necessarily available

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:54,230
what we did is we said actually let's

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,990
bring a customer into our sprint

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,390
years so our sprint reviews were to were

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,460
with the customer and what we did is we

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,380
said that we took that one story we

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,570
worked on which in this case was

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,260
scheduled a crystal report automatically

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,000
via email and we said hey user but we'd

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,100
like you to do with this tool is to

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,530
schedule a crystal report automatically

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,210
with an email now here's where the magic

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:20,330
happened this was where it got really

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:23,630
exciting so we crowd so are we crowded

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:28,160
together when I say we the developers

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:30,530
the designers the people in product even

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,380
stakeholders architects whatever we all

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:37,010
crowded around the monitor because the

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,490
user was on a WebEx and we watched the

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,890
user use what we just built so now this

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:46,880
isn't doing this user testing sometimes

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,980
six months this review six months after

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,140
you've built the thing like we just

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,570
built it we just finished it and we

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,860
brought the user in to give it a try

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:59,570
and immediately the magic happened we're

00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,760
individually the developers started

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,590
noticing something was wrong mmm-hmm

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,570
that's not right or maybe we need to

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,090
change that and then the designer said

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,160
hmm you know the the styling is not

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,190
right there hmm on this breakpoint it's

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,870
not where it needs to be and then even

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,990
the stakeholders who were observing it

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,540
went ah the user finds that valuable hmm

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,330
I wonder how we can sell that so it

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,890
created a whole interesting conversation

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,080
and at the end of the review and

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,030
observing the user use it we gathered

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,440
feedback from the user and we also took

00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,360
our notes and we compared it all

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,030
together and that was our spirit review

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,670
and then we said well based off of that

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,710
and in this case what we found was that

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,320
we gave that users a task which was to

00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,910
scheduler across the report by email we

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,040
realized that the user kind of got lost

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,860
in certain areas so we said well how do

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,470
we how do we help the user not get lost

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,050
and so then we said that's going to be

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,570
the topic of our next sprint so instead

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,160
of saying okay we built the thing okay

00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,930
off to the next user story in the

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,510
backlog no we said okay let's iterate

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:06,140
let's improve on what we've just done so

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,759
we then took that where can we said what

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,989
if we created a

00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,829
checklist and with that checklist we

00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:14,869
will

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:17,480
that'll might help the user guide him

00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:19,299
through through the process so that was

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,869
our next sprint we built the checklist

00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:26,209
so the next Rivas print review was Bree

00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:28,309
brought another user in and we said we

00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:32,540
asked them the same question except now

00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:33,980
the checklist is there and the user went

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,439
through and they saw the checklist and

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,999
then they start we started noticing that

00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:39,379
the user would use the checklist as a

00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:41,929
guide but they wouldn't know necessarily

00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:44,179
where the button was so we said ok great

00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:45,470
so now again we said well how do we make

00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,329
sure that the user knows what the button

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,850
is and that was the user story and that

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:52,429
would be our next to user story so then

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,139
we said what if when the user hovers

00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:55,970
their mouse over the check over the

00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:58,850
checklist item it highlights the button

00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,319
on the screen and that was our next user

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,899
story and we built that in another

00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,160
sprint and then we went that and we

00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,069
brought that to our next sprint review

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,720
the use another user came in we asked

00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:10,819
them the same question schedule a

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,739
crystal report via email and the user

00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:14,600
did it they without any trouble they

00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:16,309
went through the steps they follow the

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,139
checklist a B where the buttons were and

00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:19,850
then after they tried it a few times

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:21,889
they knew exactly what to do it was

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,919
baked in their missile into their muscle

00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:27,230
memory and that was it voila

00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:30,049
we got there you know and we got there

00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,910
in just a couple of Sprint's and we got

00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:35,329
something that works and works

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,730
incredibly well and then we moved on to

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:39,799
the next story at the top of the backlog

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,869
so that's really powerful

00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,779
I'm very often we tend to just go down

00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:46,999
this long path of building this thing

00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:48,649
even when we're working in in quote

00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:51,439
unquote agile but we don't necessarily

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,079
do that important bit which is really

00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:56,689
evaluate is is the thing we're building

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,419
is it actually solving the user problem

00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:04,239
and answering that question as soon as

00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:08,029
possible so the next story I'll share is

00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:10,039
when I've worked with a website called

00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:13,970
Sporting News which is also a part of

00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:16,759
the zone some years back while still

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,100
living in the United States and it's a

00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,430
sports media website where we have all

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,920
kinds of sports news and

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,350
sports contest right so one of the

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,860
things we found was we got very weary of

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,630
what I'd like to call the backlog slab

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,910
where you're just going through ticket

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:36,870
after ticket after ticket after ticket

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,640
in the backlog and we realized that yeah

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,800
we're delivering and yeah we're

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,089
delivering a lot of software but it was

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,700
beginning to feel like we're just

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,089
turning out lots of code right so we

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,290
said well let's take a break from that

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,480
not saying that doing that is

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,670
necessarily inherently wrong but we

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,620
wanted to take a break from that to

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,080
actually try and let's see if we can

00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,180
solve a problem solve some sort of new

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,190
problem so we did is we created a

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,649
one-week sprint and we based this

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,410
one-week sprint on a book called sprint

00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,510
by Jake nack definitely a book I would

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,500
most certainly recommend you all read

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:14,850
and give a try and what we said is we're

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,370
going to pull all the right people in

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,440
the room all the right people and not

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,779
just the developers the designers who

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,680
all exist in disparate departments in

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:28,650
this case developers designers you know

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,750
the product people and we even had

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:34,290
executive level stakeholders you know

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,300
VPS EVPs and we all gather together in

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,940
the same room and like as you see in

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,459
these pictures here and we wanted to not

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,860
spend the next 6 months doing upfront

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,300
requirements analysis and architecture

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,190
and all these other things we didn't

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,070
want to do that we wanted to say we want

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,870
to identify a key problem that executive

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,540
stakeholders were really frustrated with

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,180
and said we want to spend a week and try

00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,310
to really give solving that problem that

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,100
they're experiencing or that need that

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:04,620
they have a shot and it was awesome the

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,180
firt on day one the executives really

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,670
talked about the things that they really

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,140
wanted and what they needed and we

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,700
really kind of tied that into the

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,660
product about what we what we could

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:18,540
potentially do and again following Jake

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,630
Knapp's book everyone kind of did a

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,279
little bit of a design clinic where we

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,839
came in sketched up a bunch of ideas

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,390
that's one of the pictures that you see

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,220
there now and everybody participated in

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,620
this so the engineers participated the

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,699
execs participated the product of

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,309
designers everybody and

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:38,619
we ended up coming up with an idea that

00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:40,299
we all really really liked that work

00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:42,609
really really that we thought could be

00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:44,529
really work really well that we could

00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:47,139
potentially build with in a very very

00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:50,889
short amount of time and so we did that

00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:51,999
and we built a working feature though

00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,220
very bare-bones

00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:57,309
within a week when I say bare-bones

00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,429
there was boilerplate some stuff just

00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:02,379
had basic styling there were all kinds

00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:03,879
of things that you know it was a little

00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,139
bit janky here and there there might

00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,660
have been some mistakes there were

00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:09,339
definitely some bugs but that didn't

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,589
matter we just wanted to get this thing

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:13,419
built in a matter of a couple of days so

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,579
we could her even validate whether this

00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,169
would work or not instead of spending

00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,359
months and months and months and months

00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:21,609
and months and months doing all of these

00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:23,859
meetings trying to just trying to plan

00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:27,519
out whether we think it might work or

00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:29,499
not we just built it and we reviewed it

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,230
at the end of the week everyone loved it

00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:33,879
the user we tested it on we just kind of

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,919
did a hallway test with some people that

00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,449
weren't involved in it and it worked

00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,609
really well and so then we turn to the

00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,379
executives who were involved this entire

00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:43,539
week because they sat there right with

00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,029
us we said hey is this something that

00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:48,220
you want to continue should we should we

00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:49,689
try to productionize this and they said

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,579
yeah this is great

00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:53,139
so we didn't even have to go back and

00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,389
try and spend the extra time and energy

00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,009
trying to sell it to executive

00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,109
leadership because they were already

00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,269
involved they were already there and

00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:04,779
part of that that thing was their idea

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,299
anyway and it was directly connected to

00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:10,120
a specific pain that the executives

00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:12,339
really wanted to see resolved and so

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,230
they said yeah so we ran I mean just to

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:16,990
traditional Sprint's to productionize it

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:19,569
and it currently is a live feature on

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,720
Sporting News even today in fact I

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:26,110
believe it's also on the on some

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,089
editions of nba.com as well and that was

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,850
was powerful we created a brand new

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:33,010
feature that we that we didn't spend six

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,870
months trying to figure out within just

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,630
a couple of weeks and we immediately

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:41,139
reaps the value out of it right then and

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:45,519
there the final story I'll share with

00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:47,040
you guys is something way more recent

00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,160
and this is with

00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,140
my current teams here in London in the

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,200
zone and this is the in case you're

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,450
wondering the video playback team so

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,270
they're the people we're the team that

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,490
builds the the player the thing you see

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,830
when you're watching the game so pretty

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,590
important and one of the things with

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,330
this team they said guys they say came

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,340
to me and they're very mature team they

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:14,310
had been running scrum long before I had

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,710
joined them as as their scrum master and

00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:20,040
they they said you know lucky we're

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,230
really tired of scrum you know the

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,820
meetings I think they kind of they kind

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,070
of suck the way how we're doing the

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,350
tickets and refinements and this that

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,630
and the other story points they're

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,960
killing us all that kind of stuff and

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,060
they just got really weary of doing that

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,800
and they wanted to go to Kanban and

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,170
you've probably had this happen where

00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,970
your teams are you yourself go we're so

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,620
tired of all this overhead let's just go

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,990
to Kanban and everything will be easier

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,030
if we just do that and so I said you

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,450
know fine let's just go to Kanban let's

00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:53,100
just do that so we did and we stripped

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,600
away everything so we stopped having

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,340
refinement because we said we'll just

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,930
refine as we go we stopped having

00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,190
planning because we said we'll just plan

00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,770
as we go we don't need to have that

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,930
meeting we stripped all of that all of

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,180
our normal overhead in framework and

00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,820
process away when we were doing Tam ban

00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:11,700
but an interesting thing that happened

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,450
there was that the same underlying

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,460
things that the team was extremely

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:21,270
extremely frustrated about still

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,240
remained so that means that it wasn't

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:27,150
strum that was the source of the team's

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,830
frustration and it wasn't Kanban that

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,170
was going to magically make the team

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,900
feel better either because those are

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,990
just tools that merely that merely

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,850
reveal your challenges you really it

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,190
doesn't really matter what kind of

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,080
framework you're using even when you're

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,020
talking about at scale in an

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,200
organization of having 30 40 50 teams

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,050
across your enterprise if you don't

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,200
address the underlying problems and

00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:57,600
challenges that your team or your

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,850
collection of teams are encountering it

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,700
doesn't matter how well you

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,580
- - their process it doesn't matter how

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,830
well you run your strum it doesn't

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,110
matter how fast your engineers can type

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:13,010
if they if you don't address the

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,419
underlying problems that the team has

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,809
you're not going to get any better than

00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,919
you already are so at some point at the

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:21,630
beginning of this year the team

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,000
approached me and said hey lucky you

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,010
know we think we want to go back to

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,809
scrum that's not my idea now I never

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,750
suggested to them to go back to scrum

00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:33,299
this was entirely the team's idea and no

00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,280
this is not me championing scrum or

00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,730
putting down Kanban or anything like

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,590
that

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,140
the team said you know what we want to

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,750
use scrum but we want to use scrum to

00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,090
make sure we reinforce certain practices

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,650
and use it as a tool to reinforce

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,200
certain practices and that was really

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:53,039
key and the team voted unanimously to

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,440
return to scrum but with new features so

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,530
we iterated on our process our

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,539
frameworks just like you would software

00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:03,120
and we said okay well well here are the

00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,490
problems that we used to have how can we

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,159
use different things in scrum to make

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,980
those problems not exist and so we did

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,559
that and we made sure that the meetings

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,080
ran better we made sure that the

00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:18,870
teamwork was a lot tighter we made sure

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,580
we held the engineers to the right level

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,400
of accountability but we also made sure

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,390
we held the business to the right levels

00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:30,750
of accountability if we used scrum as a

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,580
tool to give us the outcomes that we

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,710
wanted and we've been doing this for the

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,809
last six months now and the team has

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,610
generally been pretty happy with it and

00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,340
a lot of the transparency and the things

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:43,289
that it created will the team want to

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,760
change this yeah they may come back and

00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:47,280
say hey lucky we want to go back to

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,380
Kanban for X amount of reasons but

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,320
before it wasn't just we don't feel like

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,600
doing refinement so let's do or doing

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,030
sprint planning so let's do let's do

00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,130
Kanban instead it's we're gonna switch

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,380
frameworks because this framework is the

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,900
best framework for this outcome or this

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,700
practice that we want to reinforce and

00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,070
they will likely change it again and

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,010
that's okay we will likely modify it

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,290
some more and that's okay take the take

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,650
the core of what something is and then

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,600
just

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:19,980
holy layer on what you think is useful

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,870
and it's going to work for you okay so

00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,010
to wrap up with some tips makes a match

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,990
don't be afraid to mix things together

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,440
and you're probably already doing that

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:34,320
very often we find people already mix

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,780
scrum and Kanban together already very

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,330
often people mix things mixed scrum and

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:43,380
extreme programming together but also

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:47,880
try to find more exotic mixes like scrum

00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:50,220
and program anarchy or mixing Jake naps

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,690
sprint model into there or maybe come up

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,210
with your own framework it doesn't

00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:56,130
matter it just has to work towards your

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,100
primary goal which is just generating

00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,850
that or that value frequently for the

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,950
customer

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:05,070
whatever practice you decide to pick

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,020
just learn it and practice it well

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:09,870
enough so that when you decide to

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,530
deviate from it you know why you know

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,150
exactly why you're deviating from it so

00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,650
that's really key it's not about just

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,720
abandoning it because you just don't

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:20,070
feel like doing it you're doing it

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,870
because there's a very specific reason

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,990
and it's giving you something by

00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:27,270
deviating from it is the same thing with

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,340
your again going by modifying for the

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,220
rights reasons the same thing it needs

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,640
to reinforce the outcome that you want

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,850
if there's a rule or a pattern or a

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,610
practice or something that is not

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,950
reinforcing the primary objective which

00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,060
is frequently generating values then

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,930
maybe it needs to change

00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,430
beware of extremes balance is key if you

00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:54,000
you don't want to be too authoritarian

00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:56,370
and have too much process but you also

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,080
don't want to have zero process or zero

00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,730
things and you know having too many

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,680
meetings is a problem but have not

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,710
having any meetings at all is also

00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:07,170
another serious problem and when in

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:10,020
doubt just let the agile manifesto just

00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,730
be your guide if you're following the

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,070
four lines of the manifesto if you're

00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,710
aligned with the 12 principles as well

00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,600
you're probably going to be okay even if

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,000
you're not following something perfectly

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,190
let that be your guide and follow it and

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,810
just remember just keep your eye on the

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,300
prize which is the most important part

00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,490
is generating frequent valley

00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,260
to the customer right if that's not

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,750
happening then you need to reevaluate

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,970
your entire delivery model at a team

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,710
level at an organization level if that's

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,140
not happening you need to re-evaluate

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,480
that and you need to and how do you

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,670
sustain that is having a creative

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,290
collaborative environment so if you

00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,270
don't have a creative collaborative

00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,190
environment any frequent value that

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,470
you're trying to generate is not going

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,470
to last very long

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:59,490
so I thank you all very much I hope you

00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:01,170
found these experiences useful and I

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:05,400
guess at this point I will have

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:07,860
questions right yeah thank you by the

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,990
way I'm Robin Nick if you want to jump

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,809
in or ask any questions

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:16,590
then feel free so the first question was

00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:18,630
from Prem Kumar and it's two questions

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,570
so firstly what was your team's velocity

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:24,300
and the next question was what technique

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:27,210
did you use to prioritize items from the

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,830
backlog good questions and I'm assuming

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:32,040
velocity was probably talking about my

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,480
first example with with the team we only

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,750
worked on that one story at a time

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,120
so our first velocity for our first two

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,670
spirit couple of Sprint's was like one

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,000
one ticket one user story

00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,740
and in that particular case how we did

00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,140
estimation because estimating and

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,200
velocity sometimes go hand in hand we

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,480
did an initial story points estimate

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,010
across all of the major user stories we

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,440
wanted to do so it was like twenty or

00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,240
thirty of them and then we didn't really

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,130
worry about points after that because

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,840
they have served their purpose we did an

00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:07,320
estimated and every once in a while we

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,360
would really but in terms of velocity

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,270
the first few Sprint's it was literally

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,370
one story but as we kept going we got

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,280
better right so we got better at

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:19,679
delivering one story and so then we

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,720
started being able to say okay we can do

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,820
delivery if we were able to deliver one

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,980
story we were able to get that done

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,780
within the first two days at Sprint we

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,460
didn't of course sit on our thumbs we

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,809
went we were then said okay we're a

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,790
little bit more confident now we can

00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:34,770
pick the next story at the top of the

00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,870
backlog and work on that together but

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,200
only after the first one is 100 is done

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,190
right so that's how we scaled our

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,549
velocity is

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,409
as we got better and as we got better at

00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:49,229
solving the users problems we got more

00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:51,239
confident at completing a story early

00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:53,340
and literally enough in the sprint to be

00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:56,070
able to start a new start on a new story

00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,919
in the spread again that not necessarily

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,710
100% scrum compatible but we found it

00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,799
was very effective at us managing what

00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:08,039
we could handle and every single time

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,349
we've always had not just a working

00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,989
working story at universe sprint we had

00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:16,220
a working product at the end of every

00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:19,739
sprint which was very powerful of course

00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,720
ok I've got another question from Adam

00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:24,749
and he said how do you get buy-in from

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,450
management frequently I've seen that the

00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:28,769
immediate team are able to change but

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,529
the management they're supposed to

00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:36,899
travel to accept the change will that

00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:40,049
value uh for me I find that the only way

00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:42,720
to get the buy-in is to get them to see

00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:43,919
the results of it because if you you

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,639
could come up with all kinds of

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,289
proposals and data and stuff and and the

00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:51,359
optimist in me would like to say yes

00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:54,899
stakeholders would buy into that but in

00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:57,539
my experience you usually have to give

00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:59,879
your stakeholders something to point to

00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:02,399
so you got to create a success story

00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:04,169
sometimes that involves asking for

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,999
forgiveness rather than permission and

00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:07,259
say hey we just went ahead and did this

00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:09,979
and look we'll see what we got you out

00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:12,989
of that we can do more of that so

00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:16,470
sometimes you just gotta just do and

00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:18,269
just do it and and then and then let it

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,849
be successful and then now you have

00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:22,559
something to point to to your

00:28:20,849 --> 00:28:24,090
stakeholders to say hey if we do more of

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,849
this you're gonna get more of what you

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:31,859
want next question is from Vivek and

00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:33,479
dimensioned in the third example what

00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,039
was the underlying issue that was

00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:39,059
finally addressed when you went back to

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:44,879
scrum yeah oh man there were quite a few

00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:48,029
underlying issues well mainly it was it

00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:49,049
had to do with a making sure we one of

00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:50,940
the biggest things for us was

00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:52,229
prioritization and actually that was I

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,149
think the second part of someone else's

00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:56,240
question so that actually reminds me to

00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,900
answer the two together

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,080
prioritisation was one of the

00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,820
fundamental issues because many many

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,070
companies like the zone were growing

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,960
very fast we want to be able to do a lot

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,750
of things and do a lot of things fast

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,550
but guess what happens is the magic word

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,870
had the magic sentence happens when you

00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,420
say oh what's in what's the most

00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,180
important thing and someone requires

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:21,390
everything is important so we started so

00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:25,530
we had to address that by a making sure

00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:27,750
we really empowered the product owner to

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,060
be able to make decisions about what

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,160
comes first and what comes next and the

00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,370
second thing that we did is we regularly

00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,740
had these guess you could say seminars

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,930
or workshops but we laid out all the big

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,850
programs of work we brought in all the

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:46,440
stakeholders together and we almost kind

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:48,060
of did a poker game to decide what what

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,720
was more important than the other

00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,610
and we always emerged out with an actual

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,590
prioritized list the final thing is is

00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:57,810
again kind of getting sponsorship for

00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:59,760
saying let's work in this better way as

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,830
we said okay guys let us work on just

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,560
this first thing this first program and

00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:06,630
let us deliver it and then you'll see

00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:09,180
that we'll get that one program done

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,820
faster than if we were to try to work on

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,620
all 15 programs simultaneously and and

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,630
they let us do that and they saw the

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,550
results of that and it worked very well

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,350
so that's why we addressed that was one

00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,000
of the underlying issues we had we had

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,130
others even just kind of inside the team

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,200
but yeah you got to address those kind

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,000
of issues and scrum Kanban none of that

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,300
stuff's gonna save you from those types

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,300
