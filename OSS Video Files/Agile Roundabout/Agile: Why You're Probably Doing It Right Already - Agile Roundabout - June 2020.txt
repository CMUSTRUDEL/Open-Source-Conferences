	00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,890
we hear kind of talk about like why

00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,750
you're probably doing this right already

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,730
so first of all I'm Nick Walker I'm here

00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,230
because I love to give presentations of

00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,910
course and from the safety of my own

00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,410
home it's even easier but what I kind of

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,810
want to focus on a little bit today is

00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,519
not just about some of the things that

00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,050
you know Robin and Jonathan that have

00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,699
been talking about but also how to

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,800
develop you as a person like we're all

00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,869
agile ists and something that I've spent

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,730
a lot of time thinking about the past

00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:32,739
couple years is I've kind of got into

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,800
more leadership positions and and so on

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:39,280
is how to help all of you become much

00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,629
better at what you do so you can find me

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,430
an ego Walker and of course you can

00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:47,859
always stalk me on LinkedIn okay um now

00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,390
the topic of agnostic hi-jon kind of why

00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:51,160
you are probably doing this or I already

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,170
like why does that even matter like why

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,260
are we talking about it so I want to

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,320
share with you some some examples of

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,789
things of why probably does matter

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,089
so let's talk about jobs basically wool

00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:06,390
now there is a bit of a silver lining I

00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:09,730
think sometimes to companies like mine

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,230
fully remote and can recruit I'm sure

00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,090
there's a lot of people out there that

00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,440
are currently looking for new work so

00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,000
let's kind of imagine the scenario for a

00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,300
second that you're looking for a new

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,400
scrum master job and you know your

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,380
interpretation that was gone master hits

00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,060
a certain criteria but I was looking at

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,240
LinkedIn today and I came across a

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,970
couple of job specs the first one here

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,210
take a couple of first bullet points

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,470
okay cool looks good right

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,880
responsibilities yeah okay this is

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,790
another one my litter pulled again a

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,820
couple of them out what I want to be

00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,010
focus on is these two in particular one

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,110
facilitate scrum events to be purposeful

00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:50,230
effective encourage continuous

00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,640
improvement second one responsibilities

00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,070
all planning around effectiveness

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,900
repeatable sprinting for a long running

00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,190
team prime and sprint panning sprint

00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,250
ceremonies loyalty

00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,900
and deployment and I appreciate you know

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,250
some of the wording in there is kind of

00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,270
whatever but that essentially implies

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,800
the us that scrum master will be

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,090
facilitating running those ceremonies

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,750
and I think for a lot of us that would

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,090
be pretty common right but if you look o

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,890
scrum dog and you look at the official

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,840
what a scrum master does and what it

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,450
does for development team so this is

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,340
kind of the text taken from from the

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,680
scrum dog website you know the founders

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,280
of scrum they talked about facilitating

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,750
scotland's and it's requested or needed

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,830
let me say it's a mandatory thing they

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,430
don't say something that you should be

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,420
doing and it's requested or needed I

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,760
think it's a really important

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,130
distinction to make how you know even

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,100
something that is you know specifically

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,960
called out as a specific job role such a

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,600
scrum master has such a different

00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,820
distinction in terms of what it is going

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,440
to do and what it isn't going to do and

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,700
I think the reason why I'm kind of

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,410
pointing this out you always because

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,570
depending on your organization and the

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,640
way that it defines what that job role

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,680
is and what the job specification is it

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,620
can massively change kind of actually

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,760
how that kind of affects you all kind of

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,050
customer impacts from the way that

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,180
you're working your philosophy that your

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,510
values just purely or something as

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,630
simple as that so let's kind of think

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:20,320
about some of the questions of why that

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,020
has an impact what the expectations so

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,970
hands on rolls hands off role do you

00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,000
facilitate do you coached you guy do you

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:32,160
leave don't but what's actually

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,540
important is it a process or an outcome

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,790
you're neither of those first job specs

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,100
did it talk about what the purpose or

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,680
the why was you're gonna facilitate

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,750
these ceremonies great they're going to

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,980
be wonderful ceremonies and much like my

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,420
kind of presentation fellows you know

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,980
saying very similar things it's like

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,070
what's it actually about like what is

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,570
the kind of importance for this and

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,310
something that Ken Schrader's wrote and

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,130
I love this because it uses the word

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,660
flaccid usually this would be the crowd

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,880
and as Rob said you kind of hopefully

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,040
engage a bit of a reaction and a bit of

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,960
a laugh but there are many instances of

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,700
flaccid scrum teams whether using the

00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,540
scrum vocabulary but weren't able to

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,579
create a potentially

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,459
shippable increment of functionality

00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:17,079
within a single spring I think that's

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,699
really really important I think that

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,769
that quote is lovely not just because of

00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,810
the flaccid part but because you've got

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,430
a job spec where some of us will be

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,350
going to apply for these jobs you have

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,210
organizations that say we're going to

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,710
track this talent we're going to have

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,030
these people that are going to be join

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,460
us and they're going to do these things

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,930
but actually don't necessarily mine up

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,789
with the original intention of what it

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:42,639
is but it's also about what they don't

00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:44,139
say something kind of as part of doing

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,419
this talking you know having done this

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,370
for a long time now you know people look

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,770
at the you know even the agile manifesto

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,720
and you know the millions of books and

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,190
the you know dozens and dozens and

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,590
dozens of organizations that provide

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,180
training and how they do this but with a

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,660
lot of it is about what they don't say

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,970
so will it kind of shake some some

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,780
perceptions maybe and talk about scrum

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,759
and Spotify so this is another thing is

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,530
like when I wrote this I didn't kind of

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,880
necessarily consider I can't have

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,570
people's hands up so you have to come

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,930
bear with me here

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,630
but on scrum dork so this is Ken

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,919
Schreiber and Jeff Sutherland websites

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,349
to vote for those who don't know or

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,849
unfamiliar with the names they found in

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:26,380
scrum they kind of come up with that

00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:28,659
scrum and they make millions and

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,330
millions of dollars kind of on this but

00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:32,680
they've got a community forum and I love

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,380
this because I looked into it it's

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,880
something so so simple in the scrum

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,530
guide it talks about the optimal

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,690
development team being three to my

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,400
members I was talking to someone about

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,190
this and they said it was seven plus and

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,110
minus two and then I replied he's three

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,060
to nine and apparently I was wrong

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,740
because that's not what the guide says

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,690
the guide says it should be this and I

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,310
said this and I was told that it's wrong

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,830
so what is the correct size for a team

00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:00,010
and it kind of made me chuckle a little

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,380
bit because there's always that argument

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,840
if like why does it even matter by why

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,729
someone having the conversation about

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,800
what size team works and what size team

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:10,270
doesn't by an arbitrary rule that

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,310
doesn't have the context of the problem

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,750
they're trying to solve and again

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,940
thinking about those job specs for a

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,220
second it doesn't think about what the

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,560
overall purpose is why do you need a

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,690
team of plus or minus but seven plus and

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
minus two in the first place is because

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,780
you're trying to do something really big

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,820
is it because you're trying to meet a

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,500
certain goal or an outcome who knows

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,360
it's not even part of the conversation

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,860
it's just an arbitrary rule because the

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,139
guide says that you need to do this or

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,970
you need to do that or you know Jeff

00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,560
Bezos says that you need to have you

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,960
know teams that can be fed by you know

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,310
no more than two pizzas like actually

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,050
what's the context in that we kind of

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:49,150
look at these things and and hold them

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:51,160
up as this really almost biblical text

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,440
that is kind of guiding us in the ways

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,050
that we do things and actually even kind

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,730
of here in the scrum dog website you are

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,720
someone having you know discussion about

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,640
team sizes really really kind of odd but

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,900
I also kind of know I mean it's going

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,660
quite well as I'm sure that many of you

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,010
do but any guest is into and again the

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,210
ordinance participation things not going

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,810
to work okay so I'm going to fit in for

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,430
you but what is it not mention you think

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,380
you scrum you kind of go yeah we run the

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,120
scrum so many companies out there say

00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,640
yeah we're a jar we run scorn

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,440
we do that we kind of we have stand-ups

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,870
we have this we have that but did you

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,510
know that in the scrum official scrum

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,950
guide so if you go and trained by Jeff

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:32,080
Sutherland who are known kind of spoker

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,910
agile roundabout last year was actually

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,180
fantastic I've got huge amounts of

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,970
admiration for him doesn't mention user

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,419
stories once and the whole guide doesn't

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,419
talk about user stories not in there

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,860
it also doesn't mention velocity or any

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,010
productivity metrics for that matter

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,500
doesn't talk about them and yet I'm sure

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,080
that many of you are the through

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,750
personal experience or talking with

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,180
colleagues or anything like that will

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,470
take yeah we run scrum where you go for

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,360
an interview yeah we run scrum we're

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,310
agile we have a user stories that's part

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,539
of your job spec that's part of the

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,550
thing that we have and kind of the

00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,200
artifacts that you have and we talk

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,260
about velocity we care about glossiness

00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,840
with scrum wasn't mention it so good

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,700
through a bad thing I'm not quite sure

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,760
but what it does kind of highlight is

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,250
that most the time that these guides or

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,039
these you know official certifications

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,050
these you know things that we kind of

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,880
look to to help shape our teams and help

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,169
show up the way that we worked don't

00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,209
necessarily have all the answers

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,530
I'm much like I think both Rob and

00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,180
Jonathan are kind of a loser

00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,080
you know bringing in that mix match of

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,220
things

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,900
they're going to help us achieve this is

00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,250
actually the right way to do it and

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,180
hence the kind of site that's all you're

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,140
probably doing this right already

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,690
Spotify model I think is another

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,390
fantastic example and it's something

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,740
that I've been fortunate enough to have

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,960
hands-on experience with you I've been

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,150
to a few talks by people that you know

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,720
we're agile coaches from the very early

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,310
days of Spotify I've also met and spent

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,590
time with Jimmy German who is you know

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,360
now 7u himself and and doing very very

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,160
well as the consulting kind of places

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,670
I'm sure you're all very familiar with a

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,650
Spotify model essentially for those that

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,350
don't know it's an organization and

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:20,080
management system for how we should be

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,960
structured it talks about tribes squads

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,330
chapters guilds as a way of organizing

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,690
people around work and functions within

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,480
a company for a lot of years it was very

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,250
much considered to be the Oh m'god

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,900
Spotify is growing and scaling and it's

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,390
doing wonderful and it's kind of going

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,310
on to the stock exchange and people are

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,070
making lots of money we should copy them

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,360
and the Spotify model was kind of seen

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,350
as one of those ways that they could do

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,350
that because they published a white

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,540
paper about it but here's a lovely quote

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,270
from from your kin syndrome who's an

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,000
agile coach from 2011 to 2017 at Spotify

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,100
he said even at the time we wrote it we

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,680
weren't doing it it was part of an

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,120
ambition part of approximation people

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,940
have really struggled to copy something

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,950
that didn't really exist and I find that

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,990
absolutely amazing and I've been

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,430
fortunate enough to spend time with some

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,320
people from Spotify and they've said

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,800
this all along it was never intended to

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,420
be something that people should copy it

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,680
was meant to be something to attract

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,050
talent and it was meant to be something

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,820
to kind of let some light into what was

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,560
going on inside the company and kind of

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,350
expose some of that and you know there

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,890
are people out there that will sell you

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,980
the Spotify model and it didn't take too

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,180
much time to find kind of training

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,620
institutes and I'm sure there's kind of

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,360
many more consultants out there and and

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,560
thankfully it's drifted off the past

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,940
kind of couple years but there were

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,760
people out there that will sell you this

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,640
Spotify model yeah you have people from

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,110
Spotify some of which probably were

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,970
quite instrumental in creating the model

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,350
in the first place telling you that it's

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,780
not something that you should do and

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,790
there

00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,710
Consultants out there that will will

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,240
sell you it I think definitely in the

00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,770
wrong wrong job for me because I'm sure

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,200
they've been a ton of money doing

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:04,850
it were the two things that again code

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,260
for two examples or any of you is you

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,200
know you've got this kind of scrum

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,390
master job roles that are coming about

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,740
the scrum guide saying not necessary the

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,570
same thing and I realize that there's a

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,180
bit of interpretation in that but kind

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,950
of different things in there and then

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,350
you have you know two very clear

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,000
examples of something that you know

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,820
sometimes get bundled together like

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,380
scrum user stories velocity not the same

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,510
doesn't actually it's not part of it

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,800
Spotify model people look to it as a

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,530
thing that they should be aspiring to

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,090
trying to achieve trying to perfect not

00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:39,560
really a thing not something that people

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:41,030
should be doing so probably why and one

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,250
of the things where this is I want to

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,950
you know back to my original point about

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,450
why I want to push this point to all of

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,800
you is I'm sure but for a lot of me

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,290
you're probably doing this right already

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,110
you are successful people in what you

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,760
were doing you're you know doing very

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,010
well you're kind of helping your team's

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,360
achieve things but there's still that

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,700
kind of strive and I see this in a lot

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,230
of people I've interviewed dozens of

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,270
people over the past month as my team is

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,410
growing and you kind of meet people that

00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:11,410
talk about trying to perfect that

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:13,820
process trying to perfect you know that

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,350
methodology or framework because they've

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,850
been trying to achieve and really forget

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,040
the essence of what this is all about in

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,790
the first place it's about being

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,740
contextual and agnostic I think but

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,810
actually none of this matters for a

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,250
second right because even me talking

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,680
about all of this and preaching about

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,230
how Spotify isn't right and scrum isn't

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,880
right is feeding into all of that you

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,590
know I'm talking about how Spotify is

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,150
they're seeing a lot of theory and scrum

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,440
isn't seeing another thing and I'm

00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,240
actually kind of feeding into that

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,200
because I'm not emphasizing what's

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,660
important in the first place so this

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,060
thing about this are you're helping your

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,710
customers is your team delivering again

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,850
the audience-participation thing I

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,950
should have thought about this a lot

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,690
more before I wrote it but I'm sure if I

00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,360
was to ask every single one of you face

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,890
to face and say are you helping your

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,900
customers or your team is your team

00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,220
delivering I'm fairly sure all of you

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,200
would say yes

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,790
because in some capacity you were

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,590
helping make that happen

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,440
and in some capacity you're achieving

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,970
that whether it's fantastic or you kind

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,220
of give yourself an 8 out of 10 9 out of

00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,800
10 10 out of 10 of how you're doing that

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,950
different thing but are you helping your

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,870
customers probably great wonderful is

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,700
your team delivery yes it is we are

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,580
delivering something could be better

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:32,390
absolutely but are we delivering yes we

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:34,690
are are you providing value and I think

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,680
you know again kind of both my

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,090
compatriots in kind of presenting today

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,280
and talking about that value is your

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:44,030
business working you know are you

00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:46,100
hitting those KPIs okay ours kind of

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,520
whatever it is like are you working

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,050
towards that yes probably in which case

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,610
why are we going to get so wrapped up as

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:57,200
kind of practitioners in our in our

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,760
craft about why we're trying to strive

00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,830
towards scrum or why we're trying to

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,030
drive strive towards these things that's

00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,580
really what I want to challenge all of

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,380
you today to really think about what the

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,210
essence is of what you're all actually

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,410
doing and not only that but certainly

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,020
you know as a question before about

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,940
senior management what is it that we're

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,440
trying to do what we're trying to

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,180
provide value to customers we're trying

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,290
to make a business successful well then

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,570
why are we trying to hit certain

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,820
methodologies or talk about scrum in

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,680
certain ways it's about these things and

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:28,520
you can achieve that in a million

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,160
million different ways the state of

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,600
agile 2020 I think is really a great

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,160
report and I think what kind of really

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,490
just some of these it's been going for

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,420
about 14 years now and the the 2020

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,120
report came out earlier this year it

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,230
talks about lost different things but

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,820
one of the things it talks about is

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,610
agile adoption some of the reasons

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,170
behind that and so giving you all an

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,690
idea this isn't just a kind of a small

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,760
sample size it's about 40,000 agile

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,950
executives and practitioners you know

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,020
across the globe primarily Europe and

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,950
North America but also increasing the in

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,600
Asia and but I really love this metric

00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,120
because it's how success is measured

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,730
with agile project business founded it

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,520
with customer user satisfaction 46 and

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,110
45 percent of people responded said that

00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,499
was the thing that we're using to

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,569
measure successor projects

00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:21,749
it's amazing but third on the list

00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:24,749
unfortunately is velocity and who gives

00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:26,969
a about velocity oh really it's a

00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:28,829
great metric to help make drive your

00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,359
team's and make me kind of help them

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:32,759
understand their work a bit more but the

00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:35,279
essence of it business value delivered

00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,719
customer user satisfaction and that's

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,819
how we should think about these things

00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:40,889
it should give us away from the idea

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:43,409
that we have to follow scrum or scrum

00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:45,119
sayers or Spotify do this and we should

00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,159
follow Spotify because they've had

00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:49,919
success what's useful for us what's the

00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,869
context for us and how can we be

00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:56,129
agnostic in our approach to best achieve

00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:57,989
that so let's do something else as a

00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,759
group as our job practitioners let's do

00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:02,729
something else because it's never going

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,289
to be perfect and I think that I

00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:07,429
personally suffer from this quite a lot

00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:09,989
is you know you kind of look for those

00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:12,599
absolutely perfect processes I've got

00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:14,549
this idea in my head I love any kind of

00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:15,689
board and flow chart and it's going to

00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,009
look like this and I'm gonna have all

00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:18,659
these artifacts and things that's going

00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,459
to happen and then two weeks in it

00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:22,679
doesn't work or something has to change

00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:24,899
or something kind of goes awry it will

00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,339
never be perfect but what actually is

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,039
the point of you doing it in the first

00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:32,189
place to achieve that customer values to

00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,779
achieve that you know business value is

00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:35,699
to please your customers is to make a

00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,479
difference to to those things that

00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:40,189
you're going to do that it's going to

00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:40,189
outline your kind of business's success

00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,119
one of the things and I've used this a

00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:49,229
couple of times to infuse me favor

00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:51,720
you're not a bit because people may have

00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:53,789
probably heard about Kaizen it's the

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,229
idea of you know continuous improvement

00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:57,179
but I really love this in a common where

00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:59,549
I found it from but I've kept it up my

00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,529
desktop is kind of a quick quick

00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:03,029
referral but it's the idea of making the

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:06,240
rule follow the rule improving the rule

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:07,799
and you know writing Rob kind of refers

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,299
this is got or maybe Jonathan was

00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:10,860
talking about the agile manifesto and

00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,409
actually if you look in there there is

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,699
and the same with scrum it's not about

00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:17,399
what they say it's about what they don't

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,829
say a flexibility that you have that

00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:24,419
autonomy that you have that context that

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,799
you should try and follow about what it

00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,629
is you're trying to achieve and how

00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,870
you're going to achieve that and how you

00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,340
should continually adapt and innovate on

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,290
techniques and frameworks that you have

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,210
and look not Ovilus are going to be

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,610
lucky and fortunate enough to come up

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,230
with a next spot afire model they know

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,480
for as much as they're committing it or

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,850
or found a new methodology and have a

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,740
huge industry behind it like scrum and

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,059
the certifications that kind of go with

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,670
it and let me tell you that is a

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:51,500
multi-million dollar industry but

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,270
certainly for our context and we know

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,400
this better than most people because

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:58,670
we're the ones working in it what works

00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,559
for us what works for our customers how

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,390
best we tie those two things together

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,570
and actually I think that the idea of

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,550
taking something following it improving

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,700
it that's something that we should

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,990
really kind of learn from so I want to

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,240
kind of leave you with a with a kind of

00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,590
a few things that I think are really

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,000
challenging I kind of personally like

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,860
talks that are always very tangible

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,360
towards the end so I want to kind of

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,800
leave you with these with these thoughts

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,410
if there was ever a screen shot that you

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,750
can take this is it

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,010
challenge are we it will go away and I'm

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,590
going to make sure that you challenge

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,809
the people around you so when someone

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,850
defines agile as a tool or a process or

00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,590
a framework or use the phrase or well

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,210
scrum says or I read this article the

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,140
top me this that and the other I want

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,840
you to challenge it

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,580
I'm going to make sure that you ask the

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,410
question is that right for us is that

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,300
right for our customers is that going to

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:51,710
be the best way that we were able to do

00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:54,140
something I'm going to learn are we need

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,880
to keep attending meetups obviously our

00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,620
waiting to read books watch videos take

00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,900
courses go to conferences I never want

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,900
you to stop as our job practitioners

00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,679
about how you can learn how you can grow

00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,900
how you can keep innovating yourselves

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,390
we need to experiment I want to try new

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,760
things are we need to innovate and I

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,130
really and really know why one thing is

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,110
better than the other one thing that I

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,390
got challenged on quite recently and I

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,000
thought this is it kind of certainly

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,860
shook my view is why can we estimate in

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,620
time rather than estimating in the story

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,330
point and I was shocked I like no

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,650
way you couldn't like time is evil it's

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,500
horrible my experience telling me this

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,600
but actually if they were to experiment

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,060
them one was better than the other like

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,560
what if I'm wrong the kind of that

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,730
experimentation and having you know

00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,860
proof is in the pudding I think he's

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,299
very valid

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,340
the data kind of behind it in trying

00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:47,860
different techniques you know to figure

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,179
out what works for you in the context of

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,250
your team in the context of your

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,980
customers in the context of what you're

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,730
trying to achieve don't kind of fit you

00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:00,279
know one size doesn't fit all certainly

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:02,019
keep an open mind you may have your

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,490
favorites but being open to other ways

00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:07,149
of doing things I think is incredibly

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,340
important even in the you know state of

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:12,730
agile kind of report it talks about how

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,460
you know safe and scrum is kind of 80 to

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,860
85 percent of the overall respondents

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,809
preferred methodology you know that

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,970
means that somewhere out there there's

00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:24,820
85 percent of those forty thousand

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,159
people are doing scrum probably not

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,899
quite how the original book was intended

00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,950
or how it kind of lays it out because

00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:33,360
I'm sure they're using lots of other

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:36,309
methodologies but it means that they're

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,110
identifying as scrum but what if there's

00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:40,000
something better what if there's a tweak

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,409
in there that they have made and they're

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,440
not kind of calling it out which is

00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:46,149
better afraid of being you know not

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,120
fitting that checkbox on the recorded

00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:50,919
report I'm really interesting so keep an

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,539
open mind think about the different

00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,450
things that are going on think about the

00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:57,789
opportunities that you have be agnostic

00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,620
I mean this is probably the the most

00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,299
important one for this is agile as a

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,760
culture and a philosophy and it's

00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,769
ultimately a set of values if you think

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,750
about the original agile manifesto it is

00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:10,350
a series of values it doesn't talk about

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:13,000
any specific methodology and that

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,529
ultimately implies that there are lots

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,179
of different ways of being able to do it

00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:18,039
and it should be about the context that

00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:19,570
you're in there are lots of ways to

00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,690
achieve the things that you're trying to

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:26,470
achieve don't be limited by a single

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,909
methodology or more and lastly and

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,419
probably equally as important as the

00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:32,889
last one think about the context what

00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:34,750
does your team need what does your

00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:36,460
company need but most importantly what

00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,190
does your customer need and how best can

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,830
you achieve that something that it took

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,230
me a quite a few years after discovering

00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,789
you know agile and scrum and Kanban and

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,200
lean and no all the other kind of

00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:50,830
wonderful methodologies that we're all

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,870
here kind of around about you know was

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,850
there is a place for waterfall there are

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,360
projects that waterfall is more suited

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,860
to

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,870
and actually there are things that I can

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,300
take from waterfall and scrum and agile

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,300
and most of them all together and find a

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,650
really incredible way of doing things

00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,870
but I didn't think about the context for

00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,430
quite a few years was I oh no I comment

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,170
I can't use that it's it's old it's

00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,000
horrible it's nasty it like we don't do

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,740
that anymore we're jar but it's kind of

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,540
feeding into that thing of you know

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,550
perception rather than about need and

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,340
about context so think about your

00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:24,250
context what it's going to change

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,930
between now and in six months time in

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,610
six months time you shouldn't be doing

00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,960
the same thing anymore should be

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,090
different because you're certainly not

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,040
working on the same thing your customers

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:37,990
have evolved and changed and their needs

00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,430
have changed why haven't you change and

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,370
last thing I wouldn't you ought to think

00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,010
about your skills as very much as a

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,500
toolbox how do you build it and how do

00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:50,380
you use it one of the analogies that I

00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,900
love to use coming from people that kind

00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,950
of part of my team is you know imagine

00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,210
you've got a toolbox

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,930
you've got wrenches you've got hammers

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:01,420
you know kind of these evades lean scrum

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,610
agile Waterfall kind of whatever it is

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,930
how do you use them and how do you gain

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,480
that experience and how do you keep

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,490
filling your toolbox because the context

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,620
is always going to change change is

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,330
always going to come so how can you

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,640
always kind of keep that toolbox full

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,670
how can you try new things and how can

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,190
you keep evolving that think about your

00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:25,270
skill set very much as a toolbox how you

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:28,120
keep building thank you very much

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,030
so I think that's me two beers in so

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,730
I'll stop talking now and pass over to

00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,320
Jonathan thanks thank you definitely

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:40,150
promoting some healthy discussions in

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:42,400
the in the chat I was reading it and so

00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,960
by the way other panelists if you wanted

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,300
to jump in at any point and ask some

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,760
questions and but we have a question for

00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,700
Mohammed he thinks do you think agile is

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,300
still relevant in the age of scrum yeah

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,690
absolutely

00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:58,780
I think agile if you imagine in your

00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:02,530
head kind of like layers our job is at

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:06,190
the very bottom it's that philosophy the

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,720
philosophy values the frameworks that

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,070
they're on top are the ways that you

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,669
achieve that

00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,950
I think that that bedrock of agile

00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:16,990
customer first no thinking about value

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,509
and even batch that original quote about

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,950
you know flaccid scrum you know the

00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:22,899
emphasis in there is not about

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,090
necessarily the process and doing the

00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:28,480
process wrong although I'm sure it was

00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,500
definitely a way of you know ensuring

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,649
that there was plenty of people that

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,929
signed up to scrum training courses but

00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:36,789
the emphasis in there is about the

00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,019
customer the value that you deliver the

00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,149
iterations that usually the

00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,309
experimentation so absolutely I think

00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:47,169
agile the core of it is that's what it's

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:49,120
representing so yeah I really do and

00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:51,100
just before we wrap up just wanna make

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,809
sure and no more questions do any of the

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:58,269
panelists have any questions last night

00:24:52,809 --> 00:25:00,580
I could throw one question out there for

00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:04,840
you Nick is you know with a lot of those

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:06,970
types of practices that get that are out

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,629
there like for example story points I

00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:14,019
often with a lot of organizations run

00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:15,850
into where where many organizations want

00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:18,730
to start codifying these things like

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:21,159
story points or are scrum or certain

00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,779
things as a matter of corporate policy

00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,509
to say oh let's standardize a story

00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:29,019
point or let's say all teams must have a

00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:30,730
daily stand-up or things like that how

00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,970
in your experience have you kind of

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,190
coach two organizations away from

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:40,659
codifying those practices as a matter of

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:46,740
corporate policy I also very precious

00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:46,740
something that comes up a lot she like

00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:52,880
what's minimum

00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,290
and that when you kind of build these

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,090
things and I'm fortunate enough to work

00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:00,980
at a company that isn't in a very strong

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:02,420
arena of growth for the moment so what

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,100
we're kind of building new teams and we

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,460
kind of build those who's that like what

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,980
is minimum yeah think about well is that

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,270
user stories is that this is it that how

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,790
do we kind of codify some of those

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,500
things but it's very much I think the

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,120
intention and the motivation behind it

00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,610
like is it a very broad kind of

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,050
foundation to involve from you know is

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,000
that way than a place to kind of get

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,100
started from and I think he's about that

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,010
kind of culture of motivation around it

00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,300
that kind of hinges for that so in some

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,370
companies that have worked in the past

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,960
and so names right now we think about

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:36,290
what's the minimum that you start from

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,240
and then how do you evolve from that and

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,920
I think that you know ultimately at the

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,360
core of it always what's going to work

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,410
for the customer well we know these kind

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,600
of things work because that's the

00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,070
cadence and scale and kind of so on but

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,860
also it's about that customer and

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:52,700
forcing that contextual change really

00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:57,020
helps to shake off that being kind of

00:26:52,700 --> 00:27:00,290
stuck on things so I think in summary

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,850
it's about what's your minimum what kind

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,770
of works what doesn't work does that fit

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,770
into your you know cadence rhythm

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,750
Governance kind of pick your poison

00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:11,140
foreign language for the company and how

00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:13,370
do you make decisions regarding

00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,890
but then after that I think it's about

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,900
how do you get the leg up for teams how

00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,820
do you get them started and then post

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,470
that how do you keep the you know

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,530
culture of innovation and culture of

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,910
change you know thinking about context

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:29,750
how do you kind of put that into all the

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:32,900
teams so it's almost like to kinda have

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:36,530
a play a play on the term a Minimum

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:40,310
Viable process as it were absolutely

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,930
it's interesting because you're Kim who

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,330
I've met before talks about the idea of

00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:47,300
Minimum Viable angel' or been a bit a

00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,280
lot viable process yeah and I think you

00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,440
know if we were to be really honest with

00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,960
ourselves for a second there is minimums

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,790
you know the idea of autonomy I think is

00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,350
a really interesting one because you

00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,910
know a lot of teams and a lot of people

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,430
aren't set up to be autonomous

00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:02,900
they're not capable of doing it so how

00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,210
about we give them a helping hand and

00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,039
say

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,240
here's where you start from and then you

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,149
evolve from there because you'll

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,710
understand the context of I totally

00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:14,990
believe in the idea of kind of a minimum

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,990
