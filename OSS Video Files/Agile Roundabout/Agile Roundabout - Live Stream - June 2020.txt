About:

Hello community - We have really missed you!

We're delighted to announce that the Agile Roundabout will be returning this month after a short break.

The theme of the event will be 'Agnostic Agile- a lesson in why you are probably doing it right already' and we will be hearing 3 talks. The speakers we have lined up are 3 speakers who have all spoken for the Agile Roundabout before! So we're thrilled to have them back for our first online event.

First up, we will hear from Johnathan Lucky, Scrum Master at DAZN.

Next up, we will hear from Robert Ord, Managing Principal and Agile Coach at Capco.

And our final talk will be given by Nick Walker, Head of Agile Delivery at iTech Media.

And there will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions throughout the webinar!
