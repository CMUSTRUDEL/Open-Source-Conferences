About:

Hello community - We have really missed you!

We're delighted to announce that the Agile Roundabout will be returning this month after a short break.

The theme of the event will be 'Agnostic Agile- a lesson in why you are probably doing it right already' and we will be hearing 3 talks. The speakers we have lined up are 3 speakers who have all spoken for the Agile Roundabout before! So we're thrilled to have them back for our first online event.

First up, we will hear from Johnathan Lucky, Scrum Master at DAZN.

Next up, we will hear from Robert Ord, Managing Principal and Agile Coach at Capco.

And our final talk will be given by Nick Walker, Head of Agile Delivery at iTech Media.

And there will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions throughout the webinar!

to welcome so many of you back I've had

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,069
messages today from people saying that

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,900
they'll be watching in the gardens part

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,879
being one person mentioned and they'll

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,979
be watching it from the beach so hope

00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,270
you can see from my face that I'm not

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:15,129
jealous and so today we're quite lucky

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,629
to have three Mason speakers lined up

00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:19,509
all of whom will be discussing their

00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:21,400
experiences of agile practices within

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,530
their workplace so first up we have

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,080
Jonathan from do zone hopefully I

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,719
pronounced that correctly then we have

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,340

the day jobs recruitment however we're

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,490
all passionate about the markets that we

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,349
recruit for and we hope these meetups

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,469
serve as a way of giving back to the

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:47,379
tech community as per normal any social

00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:50,380
media correspondence please can you use

00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:52,090
the hashtag agile roundabout and the

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,270
observant ones amongst you will notice a

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:58,060
Q&A and so you can ask any questions to

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,310
the panelists however just like a Boris

00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,199
Johnson press conference you won't have

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,659
any follow-up questions

00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,509
and so I'm sure all you guys are fed up

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:13,440
of hearing my voice now so I'll catch

00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:16,360
you over to Jonathan thank you very much

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,219
thank you so much and yep you got the

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,909
zone right very often some people say

00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:25,029
Daisy or Dodson as my father calls it

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:27,099
but yeah the zone zone so thanks thanks

00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:28,719
good for being here I think I think I

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:31,330
was at agile round about this time last

00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:34,270
year or maybe yeah sometime around this

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,159
time last year so I'm very humbled and

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:40,740
honored that you guys invited me back so

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,740
you can endure more punishment

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:48,130
so yeah just a quick little thing about

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:51,760
me so my name is jonathan lucky yep my

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,440
last name is lucky that is my surname if

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,020
you can't tell I'm from the United

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,939
States I grew up in a little city

00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:02,649
actually a big city called

00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:04,709
Cincinnati Ohio so find it on a map it's

00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:07,419
a it's an interesting place where it is

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:09,309
for the last ten years I've been working

00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:12,999
in both business-to-business and

00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:15,399
business-to-consumer software I've been

00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:18,459
involved in a wide variety of roles

00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,359
ranging from sales to marketing product

00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:24,759
marketing product management and in my

00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:29,049
current iteration of my life I am an

00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:31,720
agile coach so very exciting stuff over

00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:34,299
the years and about two years ago I I've

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,099
been with his own for about five years I

00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:39,249
transferred here about two years ago

00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:40,809
from our offices in Charlotte I'm a

00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:43,839
quick thing about the zone if you don't

00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:46,269
know what the zone is its we are a live

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,269
sports streaming platform where we

00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:51,579
stream a variety of live sports all over

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,919
the world so we're in several countries

00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,679
around the world right now including

00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:59,699
Germany Austria Switzerland Spain Brazil

00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:02,859
the United States Canada and so forth

00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:05,169
and our goal is later on this year we'll

00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:07,869
be launching globally so don't be

00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:10,209
surprised if you start seeing the zone

00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:13,419
or you start watching the zone locally

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:15,909
here in the UK so very exciting to work

00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:19,659
in sports and we're very excited to see

00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:23,769
sports coming back safely this year or

00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:25,599
relatively soon all right so let's jump

00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,149
right in one of the things is we're

00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:31,209
talking about the theme of tonight being

00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:34,449
agnostic agile and you're probably doing

00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:38,199
it already one of the things that got me

00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:39,879
thinking about is about when we often

00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:41,799
think about framework or think about

00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:45,129
agile we're thinking about the practices

00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:49,119
so the frameworks scrum Kanban XP

00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:52,599
programmer Anarchy safe Nexus scrum at

00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:53,799
scale whatever and one of the things I

00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:57,009
got to think about as I was preparing

00:10:53,799 --> 00:11:00,759
this presentation is that in reality we

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:03,819
could follow every single rule in all of

00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:06,819
these frameworks we could enforce every

00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:09,600
single practice we could have the best

00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:11,649
daily stand-ups we could have the best

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,009
sprint planning

00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:18,220
we could have a really cool-looking well

00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:20,829
grained backlog we could have the very

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,649
best cycle times we could be increasing

00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:25,449
our velocity a hundred percent sprint

00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:28,119
over Sprint we could be hitting every

00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:31,089
single deadline every day exceed all of

00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:32,199
our okrs objectives and key results for

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,339
those of you who don't know what those

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:36,519
are

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:41,319
beat every ache every KPI meet every

00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:44,199
standard and yet still fail to generate

00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:47,740
frequent value to the customer in a

00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:49,509
creative collaborative environment so

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,360
that's not to say that the stuff above

00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:54,579
is not important I have meetings about

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,129
this stuff all the time but we always

00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:59,589
have to maintain a perspective that this

00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:01,449
stuff all of the the frameworks and the

00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,819
rules and all that stuff all those

00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:06,129
things are supposed to serve our primary

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:08,589
objective which is generating value

00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:10,809
frequently to the customer and how do we

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:12,819
how do we sustain generating that value

00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:14,319
frequently to the customer it's through

00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,569
having a creative collaborative

00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:19,059
environment and so that's really really

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,980
key sometimes we get really caught up in

00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:23,529
the processes and the procedures and

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,050
stuff we're really we need to have our

00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:29,679
eye on the ball which is generating that

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:33,160
value to the customer so I figured I'd

00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,529
share three stories in my experience in

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,649
software development across my career

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:43,660
that might kind that at least for me

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:47,800
gave me a glimpse of what like that

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:51,009
really core bit of what agility is about

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,790
you know not just following scrum

00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:56,889
exactly not just doing having nice

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,139
continuous flow on a Kanban board but

00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:01,480
really that yeah we're really hitting

00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:07,059
that core of what agility is meant for

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:09,100
to to a team and to a business so the

00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:11,589
first story I want to talk about is from

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,860
a story a very from very early in my a

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:17,679
July and I and this time I worked for a

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:22,899
company that was a business intelligence

00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:25,330
and reporting software company so

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,850
enterprise software

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,459
for much of the time there the way we

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,980
built software we really believed we

00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:34,720
were an agile company where some

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,630
companies are on one end of the extreme

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,000
where they have all they have every

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,519
single bit of agile bureaucracy that you

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,620
can think of from ever having like

00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:46,750
really really like every single kind of

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,050
meeting refinements pre refinements and

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:52,540
three amigos and two amigos and release

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,730
trains and all this stuff we were

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,920
actually on the other end of the extreme

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,390
where we said we're agile so we don't

00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,290
have we're not gonna have meetings even

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,850
though we're having a meeting in this

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,100
video later on this is when we started

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,709
doing working on our agile

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,870
transformation we sit over agile we're

00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:09,519
not gonna have meetings oh you know

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,380
we're not supposed to bother developers

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,240
so we'll just give the developers you

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,740
know this vague thing and then we'll

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,690
just kind of let them run with it for

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,519
six months and then we'll come back and

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:22,630
see what they came up with and that's

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:24,399
what we thought agility was and when we

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,890
weren't getting the results as a

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,459
business that we wanted the engineers

00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:33,850
weren't happy and we said you know we

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:37,260
need to make a change and so we had a

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:42,820
photo quote proper agile transformation

00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:44,620
we decided to do scrum and but we wanted

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,160
to approach scrum a little different

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,800
from how everyone traditionally

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,529
performed scrum and we all do this my

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,029
teams do this even today your does your

00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:57,220
sprint plan and go a little bit like

00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:59,230
this you look at what the tickets that

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,720
are at the top of your backlog you guys

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,300
go okay what do we need to get done you

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,690
drag in the tickets into the sprint and

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,970
JIRA and you go okay guys is this too

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,250
much work can we handle this what else

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,690
have you got to get done all right I'll

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,699
be happy with all the work that's in the

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,740
sprint is everybody busy does everybody

00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:19,390
have something to work on you know

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,220
that's kind of how you know you

00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,839
that's how sprint planning works right

00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,449
and then everybody nods and you could

00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,250
hit click start and then go off you go

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:29,260
on your sprint the engineers pick their

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,820
little pick their individual tasks right

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,790
out of the board and then off they go to

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:36,370
do their work we wanted to approach it

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,800
differently from that so what we did is

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,860
we said we're going to just pick

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,250
one user story from the top of our

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,709
backlog just one user story and the

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,950
entire team is going to focus and work

00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:53,200
on that one user story for the Sprint

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:55,930
that's it just one just one user story

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,360
for the Sprint and what we did is we

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,880
said instead of saying let's try and get

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,820
all of the checklist done that's in the

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,950
acceptance criteria of our user story we

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,170
said well we want to look at that user

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,480
story and say what is the smallest

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:14,110
version of that story we could

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,880
potentially deliver within two weeks I

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,240
think in this case I think we grant two

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,370
and a half weeks prints so we did that

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,670
and then the team worked on just that

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,560
story together all day long so in some

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,510
cases they mob thought they did some mob

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,700
and pair programming on those things in

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,470
other cases they kind of broke down st.

00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,180
broke down aspects of that story and

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,790
they said hey I'll do I'll take the data

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:40,720
layer okay cool I'll work on the styling

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:42,360
whatever by the end of the Sprint we

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,220
also approached the Sprint review

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,470
differently from what a lot of companies

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,230
do so a lot of companies typically you

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,550
review your sprint review ends up being

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:58,660
a demo to your product owner or it tends

00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:00,279
to be a demo to stakeholders and that's

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,370
usually what we always do because the

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,470
customer is not necessarily available

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:08,169
what we did is we said actually let's

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:11,110
bring a customer into our sprint reviews

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:13,510
so our spread reviews were - were with

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,760
the customer and what we did is we said

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,949
that we took that one story we worked on

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,230
which in this case was scheduled a

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:23,470
crystal report automatically via email

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,449
and we said hey user what we'd like you

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,550
to do with this tool is to schedule a

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,590
crystal report automatically with an

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,910
email now here's where the magic

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,150
happened this was where it got really

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:37,059
exciting so we crowd so are we crowded

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:42,010
together when I say we the developers

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:44,470
the designers the people in product even

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:47,200
stakeholders architects whatever we all

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,860
crowded around the monitor because the

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,190
user was on a WebEx and we watched the

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,310
you

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,740
sir use what we just built so now this

00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:00,490
isn't doing this user testing sometimes

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,770
six months this review six months after

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,990
you've built the thing like we just

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,420
built it we just finished it and we

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,710
brought the user in to give it a try

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:13,420
and immediately the magic happened we're

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,610
individually the developers started

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,420
noticing something was wrong hmm hmm

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,280
that's not right

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,650
or maybe we need to change that and then

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:23,260
the designer said hmm you know the

00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:25,410
styling is not right there hmm on this

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,000
breakpoint it's not where it needs to be

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,670
and then even the stakeholders who were

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,920
observing it went ah the user finds that

00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:36,220
valuable hmm I wonder how we can sell

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,960
that so it created a whole interesting

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,510
conversation and at the end of the

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,520
review and observing the user use it we

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,140
gathered feedback from the user and we

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,880
also took our notes and we compared it

00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,640
all together and that was our spirit

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,190
review and then we said well based off

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,900
of that and in this case what we found

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,670
was that we gave that user two tasks

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,310
which was to scheduler across the report

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:59,590
by email we realized that the user kind

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,780
of got lost in certain areas so we said

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,900
well how do we how do we help the user

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:07,240
not get lost and so then we said that's

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,880
going to be the topic of our next sprint

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,920
so instead of saying okay we built the

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,330
thing okay off to the next user story in

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,190
the backlog no we said okay let's

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,660
iterate let's improve on what we've just

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:23,550
done so we then took that where can we

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:27,250
said what if we created a checklist and

00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:29,050
with that checklist we will that'll

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,600
might help the user guide him through

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,240
through the process so that was our next

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,750
sprint we built the checklist so the

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,030
next reverse sprint review was where he

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,160
brought another user in and we said we

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:46,360
asked them the same question except now

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,830
the checklist is there and the user went

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,320
through and they saw the checklist and

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,850
then they start we started noticing that

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,230
the user would use the checklist as a

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,510
guide but they wouldn't know necessarily

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,700
where the button was so we said okay

00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,960
great so now again we said well how do

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,430
we make sure that the user knows what

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,080
the button is and that was the user

00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,780
story and that would be our next two

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,640
user story so then we said

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,740
what if when the user hovers their mouse

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,330
over the check over the checklist item

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,240
it highlights the button on the screen

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,610
and that was our next user story and we

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,320
built that in another sprint and then we

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,510
went that and we brought that to our

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,510
next sprint review the use another user

00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,070
came in we asked them the same question

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,350
scheduled a crystal report via email and

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,030
the user did it they without any trouble

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,320
they went through the steps they

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,000
followed the checklist they did where

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,500
the buttons were and then after they

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,570
tried it a few times they knew exactly

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,570
what to do it was baked in their missile

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:40,750
into their muscle memory and that was it

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,090
voila we got there you know and we got

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,730
there in just a couple of Sprint's and

00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,150
we got something that works and works

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,550
incredibly well and then we moved on to

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,650
the next story at the top of the backlog

00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,750
so that's really powerful

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,760
I'm very often we tend to just go down

00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,640
this long path of building this thing

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,320
even when we're working in in

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,570
quote/unquote agile but we don't

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,450
necessarily do that important bit which

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,850
is really evaluate is is the thing we're

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,040
building is it actually solving the user

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,060
problem and then answering that question

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:19,090
as soon as possible

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:21,880
so the next story I'll share is when

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,890
I've worked with a website called

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,820
Sporting News which is also a part of

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:30,610
the zone some years back while still

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,950
living in the United States and it's a

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,900
sports media website where we have all

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,690
kinds of sports news and sports content

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,970
right so one of the things we found was

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:43,300
we got very weary of what I'd like to

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:45,580
call the backlog slab where you're just

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,780
going through ticket after ticket after

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:51,520
ticket after ticket in the backlog and

00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,320
we realized that yeah we're delivering

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,330
and yeah we're delivering a lot of

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,190
software but it was beginning to feel

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,130
like we're just turning out lots of code

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,130
right so we said well let's take a break

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,320
from that not saying that doing that is

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,510
necessarily inherently wrong but we

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,460
wanted to take a break from that to

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,920
actually try and let's see if we can

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,020
solve a problem solve some sort of new

00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,030
problem so we did is we created a

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,250
one-week sprint and we base this

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,950
one-week sprint on a book called

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,050
sprint by Jake knack definitely a book I

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:27,160
would most certainly recommend you all

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:28,570
read and give a try and what we said is

00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,210
we're going to pull all the right people

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:33,280
in the room all the right people and not

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,620
just the developers the designers who

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,520
all exist in disparate departments in

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:42,490
this case developers designers you know

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,650
the product people and we even had

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:48,100
executive level stakeholders you know

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:50,140
VPS EVPs and we all gather together in

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,780
the same room and like as you see in

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,300
these pictures here and we wanted to not

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,700
spend the next 6 months doing upfront

00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,140
requirements analysis and architecture

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,030
and all these other things we didn't

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,910
want to do that we wanted to say we want

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,740
to identify a key problem that executive

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,440
stakeholders were really frustrated with

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,020
and said we want to spend a week and try

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,180
to really give solving that problem that

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,940
they're experiencing or that need that

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,460
they have a shot and it was awesome the

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,750
firt on day one the executives really

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,510
talked about the things that they really

00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,980
wanted and what they needed and we

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,540
really kind of tied that into the

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,500
product about what we what we could

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:32,380
potentially do and again following Jake

00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,470
Knapp's book everyone kind of did a

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,120
little bit of a design clinic where we

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,680
came in sketched up a bunch of ideas

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,230
that's one of the pictures that you see

00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,060
there now and everybody participated in

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,910
this so the engineers participated the

00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,790
execs participated the product designers

00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:51,850
everybody and we ended up coming up with

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:53,650
an idea that we all really really liked

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,290
that work really really that we thought

00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:58,060
could be really work really well that we

00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:00,940
could potentially build was in a very

00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:04,090
very short amount of time and so we did

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,830
that and we built a working feature

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,050
though very bare-bones

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,960
within a week when I say bare-bones

00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:14,290
there was boilerplate some stuff just

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,210
had basic styling there were all kinds

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,710
of things that you know it was a little

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,970
bit janky here and there there might

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,490
have been some mistakes there were

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,200
definitely some bugs but that didn't

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,420
matter we just wanted to get this thing

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,860
built in a matter of a couple of days so

00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,840
we could hurry even validate whether

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,640
this would work or not instead of

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,720
spending months and months and months

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,600
and months and months

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,490
doing all of these meetings trying to

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,919
just trying to plan out whether we think

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,950
it might work or not we just built it

00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,710
and we reviewed it at the end of the

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,210
week everyone loved it the user we

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,769
tested it on we just kind of did a

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,750
hallway test with some people that

00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,250
weren't involved in it and it worked

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,440
really well and so then we turn to the

00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,210
executives who were involved this entire

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,460
week because they sat there right with

00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,769
us we said hey is this something that

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,049
you want to continue should we should we

00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:04,450
try to productionize this and they said

00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:06,190
yeah this is great so we didn't even

00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,960
have to go back and try and spend the

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,480
extra time and energy trying to sell it

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,399
to executive leadership because they

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,649
were already involved they were already

00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:17,889
there and part of that that thing was

00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:20,529
their idea anyway and it was directly

00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:23,169
connected to a specific pain that the

00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:25,629
executives really wanted to see resolved

00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:27,220
and so they said yeah so we ran I mean

00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:29,590
just to traditional Sprint's to

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,649
productionize it and it currently is a

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:36,159
live feature on Sporting News even today

00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:39,279
in fact I believe it's also on the on

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,830
some editions of nba.com as well and

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,440
that was was powerful we created a brand

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,570
new feature that we that we didn't spend

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,429
six months trying to figure out within

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,500
just a couple of weeks and we

00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:53,950
immediately reaps the value out of it

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:58,360
right then and there the final story

00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:00,970
I'll share with you guys is something

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,000
way more recent and this is with one of

00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,980
my current teams here in London in the

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,039
zone and this is the in case you're

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,289
wondering the video playback team so

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,110
they're the people we're the team that

00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:16,330
builds the the player the thing you see

00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,669
when you're watching the game so pretty

00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:21,429
important and one of the things with

00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:23,169
this team they said guys they stay came

00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:25,179
to me and they're very mature team they

00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:28,360
had been running scrum long before I had

00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:30,549
joined them as as their scrum master and

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,879
they they said you know lucky we're

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:36,070
really tired of scrum you know the

00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:37,659
meetings I think they kind of they kind

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,940
of suck the way how we're doing the

00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:42,190
tickets and refinements and this that

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,500
and the other story points they're

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,520
killing us all that kind of stuff and

00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,190
they just got

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,170
really weary of doing that and they

00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,540
wanted to go to Kanban and you've

00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:54,310
probably had this happen where your

00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,870
teams are you yourself go we're so tired

00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,490
of all this overhead let's just go to

00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,950
Kanban and everything will be easier if

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,050
we just do that and so I said you know

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:05,410
fine let's just go to Kanban let's just

00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,940
do that so we did and we stripped away

00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,440
everything so we stopped having

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,180
refinement because we said we'll just

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,770
refine as we go we stopped having

00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,030
planning because we said well just plan

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,700
as we go we don't need to have that

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,770
meeting we stripped all of that all of

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,020
our normal overhead in framework and

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,660
process away when we were doing tam ban

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,540
but an interesting thing that happened

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,290
there was that the same underlying

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:31,300
things that the team was extremely

00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:35,110
extremely frustrated about still

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:38,080
remained so that means that it wasn't

00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:40,990
scrum that was the source of the team's

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,670
frustration and it wasn't Kanban that

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,010
was going to magically make the team

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:47,740
feel better either because those are

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:50,830
just tools that merely that merely

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,660
reveal your challenges you really it

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,030
doesn't really matter what kind of

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,920
framework you're using even when you're

00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,860
talking about at scale in an

00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:03,040
organization of having 30 40 50 teams

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:05,890
across your enterprise if you don't

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:09,040
address the underlying problems and

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:11,590
challenges that your team or your

00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,050
collection of teams are encountering it

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,870
doesn't matter how well you optimize

00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:19,930
their process it doesn't matter how well

00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,900
you run your strum it doesn't matter how

00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:24,550
fast your engineers can type if they if

00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,030
you don't address the underlying

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,620
problems that the team has you're not

00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:32,980
going to get any better than you already

00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,480
are so at some point at the beginning of

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,270
this year the team approached me and

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,980
said hey lucky you know we think we want

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,900
to go back to scrum that's not my I

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,880
didn't know I never suggested to them to

00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,550
go back to scrum this was entirely the

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,430
team's idea and no this is not me

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:50,590
championing scrum or putting down Kanban

00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,480
or anything like that the team said you

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,580
know what we want to use scrum but we

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,790
want to use scrum to make sure we

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,990
reinforce certain practices and use it

00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,610
as a tool to reinforce

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,040
certain practices and that was really

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:06,880
key and the team voted unanimously to

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:09,280
return to scrum but with new features so

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,370
we iterated on our process our

00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,380
frameworks just like you would software

00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,960
and we said okay well well here are the

00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,330
problems that we used to have how can we

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,000
use different things in scrum to make

00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:24,820
those problems not exist and so we did

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,400
that and we made sure that the meetings

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:29,920
ran better we made sure that the

00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,710
teamwork was a lot tighter we made sure

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,420
we held the engineers to the right level

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,240
of accountability but we also made sure

00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:40,840
we held the business to the right levels

00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:44,080
of accountability and so we used scrum

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,330
as a tool to give us the outcomes that

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,550
we wanted and we've been doing this for

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,620
the last six months now and the team has

00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,450
generally been pretty happy with it and

00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:55,179
a lot of the transparency and the things

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,130
that it created will the team want to

00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:58,600
change this yeah they may come back and

00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,150
say hey lucky we want to go back to

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,220
Kanban for X amount of reasons but

00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:06,130
before it wasn't just we don't feel like

00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,440
doing refinements so let's do or doing

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,870
sprint planning so let's do let's do

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,970
Kanban instead it's we're gonna switch

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,220
frameworks because this framework is the

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,740
best framework for this outcome or this

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,540
practice that we want to reinforce and

00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,910
they will likely change it again and

00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,850
that's okay we will likely modify it

00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:27,100
some more and that's okay take the take

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,170
the core of what something is and then

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,340
just slowly layer on what you think is

00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:37,360
useful and it's going to work for you

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:39,610
okay so to wrap up with some tips makes

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,080
a match don't be afraid to mix things

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,350
together and you're probably already

00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,900
doing that very often we find people

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,510
already mix scrum and Kanban together

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,250
already very often people mix things

00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:54,250
mixed scrum and extreme programming

00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:59,020
together but also try to find more

00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:02,620
exotic mixes like scrum and program

00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,330
anarchy or mixing Jake naps sprint model

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,790
into there or maybe come up with your

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,650
own framework it doesn't matter it just

00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,510
has to work towards your primary goal

00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,730
which is just generating that or that

00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,310
value

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,160
frequently for the customer whatever

00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:19,980
practice you decide to pick just learn

00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:22,440
it and practice it well enough so that

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,170
when you decide to deviate from it you

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,120
know why you know exactly why you're

00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,950
deviating from it

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,540
so that's really key it's not about just

00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,550
abandoning it because you just don't

00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,380
feel like doing it you're doing it

00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,700
because there's a very specific reason

00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,820
and it's giving you something by

00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,100
deviating from it is the same thing with

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,620
your again going by modifying for the

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,890
rights reasons same thing it needs to

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:49,470
reinforce the outcome that you want if

00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:51,680
there's a rule or a pattern or a

00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:55,440
practice or something that is not

00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,810
reinforcing the primary objective which

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,770
is frequently generating values then

00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:03,030
maybe it needs to change

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:04,260
beware of extremes balance is key if you

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:07,830
you don't want to be too authoritarian

00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:10,200
and have too much process but you also

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,000
don't want to have zero process or zero

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,590
things and you know having too many

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,330
meetings is a problem but have not

00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:18,540
having any meetings at all is also

00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:21,000
another serious problem and when in

00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,850
doubt just let the agile manifesto just

00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,560
be your guide if you're following the

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,900
four lines of the manifesto if you're

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,540
aligned with the 12 principles as well

00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,430
you're probably going to be okay even if

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,890
you're not following something perfectly

00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:37,020
let that be your guide and follow it and

00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,670
just remember just keep your eye on the

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,580
prize which is the most important part

00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:43,410
is generating frequent value to the

00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,140
customer right if that's not happening

00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:48,240
then you need to re-evaluate your entire

00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,010
delivery model at a team level at an

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,320
organization level if that's not

00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,270
happening you need to re-evaluate that

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,850
and you need to and how do you sustain

00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,100
that is having a creative collaborative

00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,960
environment so if you don't have a

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,640
creative collaborative environment any

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,050
frequent value that you're trying to

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,060
generate is not going to last very long

00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:11,400
so I thank you all very much I hope

00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:15,030
you've found these experiences useful

00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,200
and I guess at this point I will have

00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:21,180
questions right yeah thank you

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,540
by the way I'm Robin neck if you want to

00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,530
jump in or ask any questions then feel

00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,400
free so

00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:31,710
the first question was from Prem Kumar

00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,320
it's two questions so firstly what was

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:35,850
your team's velocity and the next

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,930
question was what technique did you use

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:41,670
to prioritize items from the backlog

00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,080
good questions and I'm assuming velocity

00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,840
was probably talking about my first

00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,520
example with with the team we only

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,280
worked on that one story at a time

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,140
so our first velocity for our first

00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:56,940
two-spirit couple of Sprint's was like

00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,830
one one ticket one user story and in

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,600
that particular case how we did

00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,970
estimation because estimating and

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,030
velocity sometimes go hand in hand we

00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:08,340
did an initial story points estimate

00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,750
across all of the major user stories we

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,179
wanted to do so it was like twenty or

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,070
thirty of them and then we didn't really

00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,960
worry about points after that because

00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,700
they have served their purpose we did an

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,940
estimated and every once in a while we

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,950
would re-evaluate but in terms of

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,409
velocity the first few Sprint's it was

00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:28,230
literally one story but as we kept going

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:31,110
we got better right so we got better at

00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,510
delivering one story and so then we

00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,550
started being able to say okay we can do

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:37,620
delivery if we were able to deliver one

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,840
story we were able to get that done

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,640
within the first two days at Sprint we

00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,320
didn't of course sit on our thumbs we

00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,820
went we were then said okay we're a

00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,010
little more confident now we can pick

00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,020
the next story at the top of the backlog

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,890
and work on that together but only after

00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:55,200
the first one is 100 is done right so

00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:58,440
that's how we scaled our velocity is as

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,270
we got better and as we got better at

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,060
solving the users problems we got more

00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:05,070
confident at completing the story early

00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,170
and the early enough in the sprint to be

00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,900
able to start anew start on a news story

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:12,810
in this brand again that not necessarily

00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,540
100% scrum compatible but we found it

00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:18,660
was very effective at us managing what

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,870
we could handle and every single time

00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:24,180
we've always had not just a working

00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,820
working story at universe sprint we had

00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,080
a working product at the end of every

00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:33,840
sprint which was very powerful for us ok

00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,580
I've got another question from Adam and

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,610
he said how do you get buy-in from

00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,390
management frequently I've seen that the

00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,369
in

00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,109
Media team are able to change but the

00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:48,390
management players though struggle to

00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:52,019
accept the change will that value uh for

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:54,660
me I find that the only way to get the

00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:57,029
buy-in is to get them to see the results

00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,279
of it because if you you could come up

00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:02,339
with all kinds of proposals and data and

00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:04,109
stuff and and the optimist in me would

00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:07,559
like to say yes stakeholders would buy

00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:10,289
into that but in my experience you

00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:12,539
usually have to give your stakeholders

00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:14,760
something to point to so you got to

00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:17,010
create a success story sometimes that

00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,200
involves asking for forgiveness rather

00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,609
than permission and say hey we just went

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,740
ahead and did this and look see what we

00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:26,460
got you out of that we can do more of

00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:30,269
that so sometimes you just gotta just do

00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:32,099
and just do it and and then and then let

00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:34,650
it be successful and then now you have

00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:36,450
something to point to to your

00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,920
stakeholders to say hey if we do more of

00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:42,710
this you're gonna get more of what you

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,690
want next question is from Vivek and

00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,309
dimensioned in the third example what

00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,720
was the underlying issue that was

00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:52,920
finally addressed when you went back to

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:58,740
scrum yeah oh man there were quite a few

00:36:52,920 --> 00:37:01,890
underlying issues well mainly it was it

00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,910
had to do with a making sure we one of

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,769
the biggest things for us was

00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,059
prioritization and actually that was I

00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:07,980
think the second part of someone else's

00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:10,890
question so that actually reminds me to

00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,539
answer the two together prioritization

00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:15,839
was one of the fundamental issues

00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:18,000
because many many companies like the

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,980
zone were growing very fast we want to

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,779
be able to do a lot of things and do a

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,299
lot of things fast but guess what

00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:26,099
happens is the magic word had the magic

00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:27,509
sentence happens when you say oh what's

00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,109
in what's the most important thing and

00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:33,720
someone replies everything is important

00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:37,890
so we started so we had to address that

00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,049
by a making sure we really empowered the

00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,420
product owner to be able to make

00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:44,369
decisions about what comes first and

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,210
what comes next and the second thing

00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:49,470
that we did is we regularly had these

00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,569
guess you could say seminars or

00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,520
workshops we laid out all the big

00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:55,170
programs of work we brought

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,110
all the stakeholders together and we

00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:01,260
almost kind of did a poker game to

00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,920
decide what what was more important than

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,650
the other

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,440
and we always emerged out with an actual

00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,420
prioritized list the final thing is is

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,250
again kind of getting sponsorship for

00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,590
saying let's work in this better way as

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,600
we said okay guys let us work on just

00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:18,390
this first thing this first program and

00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,460
let us deliver it and then you'll see

00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:23,010
that we'll get that one program done

00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,650
faster than if we were to try to work on

00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,450
all 15 programs simultaneously and and

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,460
they let us do that and they saw the

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,410
results of that and it worked very well

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,180
so that's why we addressed that was one

00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,830
of the underlying issues we had we had

00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,960
others even just kind of inside the team

00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:39,060
but yeah you got to address those kind

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,860
of issues and scrum Kanban none of that

00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,430
stuff's gonna save you from those types

00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,480
of challenges okay thank you very much

00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:49,050
Jonathan we're gonna have to

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:53,760
unfortunately move on but so yeah next

00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:57,210
next talk is from Rob and he's going to

00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,780
tell us about his his experiences at

00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:04,370
Catco Thank You Jonathan

00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,370
can you locate them

00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:12,950
yep can hear you fine okay next one it

00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,330
caps not obligatory by the way just so

00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,640
happens that lucky and I are really cool

00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:18,560
and we both work it out I'm also not

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,970
related to the Chicago White Sox I just

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,860
went on a holiday there once and I like

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:24,980
the cap so I bought it I was totally

00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:27,500
gonna ask I was there

00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,610
I'm a football guy unfortunately man

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,440
city of plains nights have become

00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:37,250
overrun okay yeah thank you

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,010
to to beth fill the team for inviting me

00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,450
to talk again it's a privilege to come

00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,480
talk to this group so thank you very

00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:46,730
much for that for those of you who were

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,770
around for the last book that I did I

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,360
did the very dangerous move of bringing

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,640
in my existing client who pays my bills

00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,090
on to the stage and the risk and getting

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,320
fired

00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,700
giving the insights for what was

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,730
actually happening on the ground and it

00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:01,880
was a case study on scaled agile in

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:04,430
reality I think the interesting aspect

00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,530
was it was a completely business context

00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,090
with very little technology input so

00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,850
it's how we were applying the frameworks

00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:13,250
to fit within that model the reason I'm

00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:15,350
saying this is the the final part of the

00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,470
talk was on the effect that this change

00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:20,060
was having two individuals in the team

00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:22,940
though both are an individual psychology

00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,590
level and also how the dynamics between

00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,900
their teams will begin to form and

00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:29,900
reform and they weren't used to working

00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,580
in groups particularly they absolutely

00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,410
were used to working from a common

00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,110
backlog it was a very siloed and

00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:38,000
distributed organization so what I

00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,950
wanted to do today really is is pick up

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,280
again on that topic because it got the

00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,270
most traction on LinkedIn afterwards and

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,100
there was a number of spin-off

00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:47,900
conversations that came from it and just

00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,730
focused really on observations I've had

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,340
in the last few months since we did that

00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:54,440
talk on the impact that coronavirus has

00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,540
had now that we're all distributed in

00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,460
particular and some of the learnings

00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,710
I've seen come through not just from my

00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,270
main client but from across the client

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,520
base that I regularly talk to a Catco

00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:08,540
about making agile work in the

00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,860
distributed context so I thought I'd

00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,010
start off with a nice statistic for a

00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:14,450
McKinsey which is 62% of executives

00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,980
believe they will need to retrain or

00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:18,350
replace more than a quarter of their

00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,960
workforce between now and 2020 three

00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,130
have you used this quite a few times in

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,170
a number of client pictures that I've

00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,240
spoken to and it absolutely frightens

00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:29,690
the life out of most of the execs that I

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,370
get time with the it's not just the

00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,810
thought of losing some other workforce

00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,430
and you know we're all used to

00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,450
colleagues coming and going depending on

00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,160
their desires and what they're

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,940
interested in doing but I think what's

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,200
particularly staggering about this is

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,300
the sheer volume of people that will

00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,140
have to be retrained as well as having

00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,850
to be replaced so we we know that

00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,440
working according to the scrum book or

00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:54,290
to whichever idabelle frame what we take

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,330
as a prescribed methodology for that but

00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,800
I'm hoping that this most of you will

00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,590
resonate also with the sentiment that

00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,060
the majority of the time taking the book

00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:04,610
and applying it doesn't work and you

00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:06,320
have to make allowances for specific

00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,770
cultures within the organization how

00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,090
people are the dynamics between them

00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,380
some of the Q&A questions I was just

00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,240
answering then you know it could be

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,370
constraints of the organization factor

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,020
how you work and making sure that you

00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:21,140
still got some autonomy and flexibility

00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:23,480
there is a continual learning path in

00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,730
the field that we all operate in and I

00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,920
think the key thing that is this is

00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,330
testament that executives are starting

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,520
to take note that the way that we

00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:32,990
operate as a group is in effect the new

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,730
normal and the majority of the

00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,730
organization has to be prepared for it

00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:42,800
some of the challenges that we've seen

00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,270
come through there's a good report for

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,740
state of remote working as the race for

00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,510
the state of DevOps report state of

00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,860
agile reports so if you if you get a few

00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,140
minutes I'd absolutely recommend having

00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,810
a read through some of these what I find

00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,030
particularly interesting I guess and

00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:58,100
surprising for this is if I look at some

00:42:56,030 --> 00:43:00,620
of the some of the elements that were

00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,570
probably true pre coronavirus you know

00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,670
taking vacation time maybe working in

00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,620
different time zones stayed motivated

00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,790
they were probably the key factors that

00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,490
were being pulled out prior to

00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:12,290
coronaviruses the main challenges of

00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,450
remote working which is facing the jobs

00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:17,780
full-stop what's become more apparent

00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:19,880
since then is the the whopping 23% that

00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,160
prioritize unplugging from work all the

00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,600
20% let's say loneliness you know you

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,130
add those together you're talking almost

00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,490
half of the people who respond to this

00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,600
survey are finding it a challenge

00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,760
balancing their work life with their

00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,980
home life in this current environment

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,140
who knows when it's going to end while

00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,520
it was becoming a topic of interest to

00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,830
talk about personal well-being and

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,900
mental health prior to coronavirus I

00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,940
think we need to do more very very

00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,380
quickly to accept the fact that people

00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,020
are struggling right now and it's not

00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,750
it's not an easy way to work and as

00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:52,550
practitioners of various different agile

00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,530
theories we are absolutely the best

00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,520
place to help people make a change and

00:43:54,530 --> 00:44:00,620
give them the support they're going to

00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,090
need from it so there are three elements

00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,740
I wanted to talk through on this today

00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,750
the first one is building culture in

00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,280
connection with your team the second one

00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,780
is how you can send commitment to

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,760
yourself and to your team into actual

00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,220
habits and then the final one is just a

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,570
little perspective on caprica what we're

00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:19,900
seeing is the key dimensions for the

00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:22,310
future for work so cultural connection

00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,170
communication we know is absolutely

00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:25,760
vital important for those of you who

00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:27,080
ever done any analysis on this you'll

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,490
also know that the majority of

00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,290
communication happens through body

00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:33,140
language I think is somewhere around 70

00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:35,540
to 75 percent is usually the figure that

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,610
people take while we've got video

00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,020
conferences and you can see people's

00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,460
face and you can see their empathy or

00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:42,740
they're having sometimes it's very

00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,510
difficult to do that on scale so if I

00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,130
just come here now for example how I'm

00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,780
doing this towards you today I'm looking

00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:49,070
at my screen with a little green dot on

00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,020
my iMac which is where the camera is

00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,970
this time last year when I was doing

00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,950
this work I had 120 people in front of

00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:56,240
me I could scan the room I could see

00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,770
you're interesting when you're yawning

00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,170
see if you're stretching see if you're

00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:02,030
engaged by something else and it's that

00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,410
element of communication that we've we

00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,510
were beginning to lose because the

00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,340
environment that we're in the long term

00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,510
effects to that are yet to be seen I'm

00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,630
sure there'll be some some wider

00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:13,910
societal impacts from that but for the

00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,110
time being the key thing here is that we

00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:17,000
still need to be able to build trust

00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:18,350
with people whether that's a new team

00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,970
that we've only just started working

00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:22,550
with or whether it's rebuilding trust

00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,900
with the team members who maybe we're

00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,950
starting to lose a bit of touch with

00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,110
them because of the day-to-day

00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:29,030
interactions being lost it could be your

00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:30,260
manager that doesn't trust you to crack

00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,150
on with a worker now to provide

00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,350
extensive visibility over all the

00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,900
stories that you're working on every

00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:37,940
single day so three tips that we found

00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,950
that work particularly well is practice

00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,270
real empathy so again I'm sure you would

00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,740
have heard this before in many many

00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,280
training sessions it's not rocket

00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,710
science

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,560
when someone talks to you this

00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,810
into what they are saying actually take

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,030
in the words they use the tone that they

00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:54,740
are using what they are saying whether

00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,720
it's clear if they're fumbling through

00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,670
it is it a hard message they're trying

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,140
to give you is it a happy message we

00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,510
really listen to what they're saying and

00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:05,390
use that as the hug for engagement with

00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,220
them to be proactive in the way that you

00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:09,859
ask people how they're doing you know it

00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,180
is typical as the British people when

00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:12,619
you start a conversation now you'll ask

00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,720
how was your weekend wasn't the weather

00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:16,550
good that might be sufficient for a

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,930
face-to-face conversation but when you

00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,760
are engaging with people in this remote

00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,589
environment try and explore a little

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,089
more know you know if you know something

00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:24,140
a little bit about them whether it's you

00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:26,000
know they have a particular favorite

00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,260
sport they don't like to do rather than

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,839
saying didn't you enjoy the weather

00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:31,490
asked them you know did you enjoy you

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,710
know practicing basketball the weekend

00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,630
something like that show an interest in

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,520
who they are as individual and then

00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:39,530
finally and this contrived leave

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,890
absolutely nuts is you do not have to be

00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,900
formal all the time the number of client

00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,359
pitches I've done for extremely large

00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,890
deals where the resonating feedback

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,200
across all the different consultancies

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,300
is simply you were too formal in how you

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,910
went about your approach remember that

00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:59,300
even if the situation dictates certain

00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:01,400
levels of I suppose decorum for the

00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,930
meeting that you're in you are still

00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,960
talking to human beings and human beings

00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:07,820
respond to other human beings so find

00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,080
that balance between formal informal to

00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:14,030
really build the trust for the people

00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:15,859
you're talking to the next big bucket of

00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:18,800
challenge that we tend to see is

00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:21,560
productivity in the work environment it

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,300
is an absolute privilege actually to see

00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,560
people on conference calls when they're

00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,000
actually within their own home you get

00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,099
to learn something about how people and

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,349
I've chosen the white background today

00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:32,450
just because that's my preferred style

00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:34,130
when I do presentations but when this is

00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,780
not here you'll see behind me and a

00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:38,150
library full of different side by books

00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:40,609
and I don't mind people seeing that when

00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,170
I'm in smaller were conversations we did

00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:43,700
it lets them know something about me and

00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,400
it always strikes up a conversation with

00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,750
them about Who I am I'm looking enough

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,430
and fortunate enough to be able to do

00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,080
that in my little office and I have my

00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,660
own desk in reserved area and that's

00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,400
what I need to help me be focused in

00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:58,040
what I do my own little quiet space that

00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,599
I go to I recognize at the same time

00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,029
that's not the same for everybody

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,709
some people prefer to have you know

00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:05,719
working spaces and kitchens they might

00:48:03,709 --> 00:48:06,440
be in shared houses those of us who've

00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,670
got childcare

00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,529
you will have children running around

00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:11,630
you will ins Rob your meetings or bang

00:48:09,529 --> 00:48:13,039
on the door you might have pets you

00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,420
might be back in the office and be the

00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:15,829
young person there it is you know your

00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,519
voice is acting around the corridor

00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:22,279
there is a variety of spaces that people

00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,839
choose to work in the point behind this

00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:25,579
is you need to find the environment that

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,499
helps you and make a real change to keep

00:48:25,579 --> 00:48:31,369
that sustainable that you're able to

00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:33,109
work productively there are a variety of

00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:34,549
methods be able to do this one little

00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:37,519
one with a third of which is quite cool

00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:38,959
is the Pomodoro Technique and basically

00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:40,489
it's setting yourself a rhythm and a

00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:42,440
pattern where you have a focused bit at

00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:44,690
a time that you work on something you

00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,369
take a short break you focus again take

00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,109
a short break you focus again and then

00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:50,749
you have a longer break so it breaks

00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:52,249
down your daily work routine either into

00:48:50,749 --> 00:48:53,719
the you know the smaller stories that

00:48:52,249 --> 00:48:55,549
you've got or whether it's something

00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:58,099
bigger it keeps you ticking over on a

00:48:55,549 --> 00:49:00,049
nice pan and my biggest flaw with

00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:01,729
working is I just forget to take breaks

00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:02,809
because I get so engrossed and involved

00:49:01,729 --> 00:49:05,180
in what they're doing and I have to

00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:06,769
consciously set myself timers on my

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,249
phone to say you need to take a screen

00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:09,249
break up

00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:15,469
self-care is equally important again I

00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:17,749
prefer to play music when I'm working I

00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:19,160
don't want interruptions but depending

00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:20,630
on the type of work I'm doing a lot of

00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,219
the put a heavy metal track on or

00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,930
sometimes I'll put some classical music

00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:26,509
on and both of them help me thinking

00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:27,769
comes train in different ways I will

00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:29,690
always get addressed with the day in the

00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:31,339
morning for work and I'm going to do it

00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:33,079
in pajamas because Timothy that needs to

00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:34,489
be a step change away from my home like

00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:36,890
to my work like when I come in the

00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:38,449
office I know a lot of people who are

00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,339
much more active than me and they take

00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:41,839
great pride in that and they they block

00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:44,719
out their calendar and they are refusing

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,249
to do meetings before 8:30 and whilst

00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,440
most of us could probably do earlier

00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:50,180
because the can you have gone and I

00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,890
admire them for what they do to

00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,119
ring-fence that time the diary to say

00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:57,259
that this is me and what I have to do

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,940
there's a lot of ideas here for things

00:49:57,259 --> 00:50:01,910
that you can do with people to show them

00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,559
around I haven't seen all these happen

00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:05,749
but I've seen recipes dares happen on

00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:07,430
some of my clients sites and the MTV

00:50:05,749 --> 00:50:09,529
Cribs style video tour is a particularly

00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:11,259
good one if you're in a safe team that

00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:13,460
can always be a nice thing to do

00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:14,960
the channel

00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,640
pictures of pets has actually been a

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,220
resounding success from the clinic

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,230
founders they might used them the doctor

00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,730
also get wonderful pets that people had

00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:26,059
but I just had never idea you would do

00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:27,559
um but I guess the point is if you think

00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:30,069
about who you are as a person how you

00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:33,190
want to reflect that into your work life

00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:35,150
I'm not saying that you have to be 100%

00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:37,849
individual and personal and everything

00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:39,349
you do but it's not a problem to let a

00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:41,520
bit of your true personality and

00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:44,500
character show

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,940
stoat it's all well and good saying that

00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,590
but I suppose the challenge is how do

00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,960
you actually make it stick and sewing

00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:52,720
ideas and interested into a hobby that

00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,310
actually makes you work better I've

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,810
borrowed this wonderful formula from a

00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:57,790
colleague of mine called there Casey

00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,580
Schaeffer in the US who does excellent

00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:02,410
presentations on this topic so if we

00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,850
think about big things that we have to

00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,650
change like it you know I want to learn

00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:07,690
a new language and move to France that

00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:10,000
is a big goal that is unlikely to happen

00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:12,220
tomorrow but what you can do is make

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,750
tiny habit changes and behavior changes

00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,990
today which will stick for tomorrow a

00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:18,280
lot of this is rooted in deep theory to

00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:21,190
give you an example of something I've

00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,780
done for myself with this so behaviors

00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,030
are essentially built of three

00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,460
components as the motivations want to do

00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:29,110
something there's the actual ability to

00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,730
be able to do it and then there's a

00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:34,450
trigger or event that gives you the

00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:36,250
impetus to go up and do it so for me as

00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,290
I just mentioned with reading and I

00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:39,340
rarely get a chance to read at the

00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:40,840
moment because when I get back from

00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,220
working exhausted and I just want to

00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,580
play the kids to bed and then go to

00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,370
sleep

00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:46,780
so I have a motivation still because

00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:49,390
there's nothing I like more than going

00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:51,520
into a classic sci-fi novel and reading

00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,870
the whole thing cover to cover I know

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,520
I've got the ability to do it I might

00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,690
not be the best and quickest breather in

00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,550
the world but I'm able to go through a

00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,200
couple of chapters a day but the

00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,610
challenge for me was the trigger and

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,530
finding that moment where I would

00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:04,210
actually sit down and do the reading so

00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:07,660
one of the tiny habit changes I changed

00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:09,400
myself and my usual routine would be as

00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,050
I said come home play with the kids bath

00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,570
time bedtime and then usually go out by

00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:15,010
8:30 and maybe 8 o'clock I'll be able to

00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,930
come downstairs and that's kind of one

00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,340
day finished and I'll always go to the

00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,740
capital of make myself a tea or a coffee

00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:22,090
so what I've started doing is rather

00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,620
than making that and taking it back to

00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,270
the lounge where else to sit down and

00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,710
watch something on TV I've put the book

00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:29,020
that I want to read next to the kettle

00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,700
so that when I go make myself at tea as

00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,860
part of my routine my trigger is in

00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,030
front of me and I'm like ok I'm now

00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,680
gonna have a half an hour or an hour

00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:37,420
window I'm gonna take my book and I'm

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,070
gonna read it I'm just making like a

00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,080
slight change to my environment and

00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:43,570
where my things are has letting me take

00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,610
on this new behavior I would encourage

00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:47,410
you all to think about what that is

00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,850
whether race you know I drink too many

00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,470
beers in the evening so if that's the

00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:51,700
case take away the coffee table next to

00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:54,190
your seat and then you've got nowhere to

00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,910
put your cup it is the exercise routine

00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:57,039
and we're

00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,839
King our vi anymore doesn't work for you

00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,069
you make a note to do it at lunch time

00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,690
you know find the time or something

00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:06,400
that's going to help you do what you

00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:08,289
want to do couple of small ideas there I

00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,490
wouldn't recommend the ice cream so I'm

00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:13,720
hoping that's going to help any of us in

00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:16,450
the moment so just to wrap it all

00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,799
together from a consulting perspective

00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:21,130
and the majority work that I do dates

00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:22,990
today is advising clients on usually

00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,369
taking small agile proof of concepts and

00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:26,049
working out how they can scale that

00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,880
across the business using whichever

00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:31,089
framework is going to be scaled agile

00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:33,430
framework Spotify les dad you name it it

00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:35,890
always tends to be a blend of it but

00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:37,650
broadly through the obscene chats I've

00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:39,609
had recently there are these four

00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:43,569
buckets and people are thinking about

00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:44,890
for the future of work um the first one

00:53:43,569 --> 00:53:47,680
is the way of working that people

00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:49,539
actually have lucky I thought it was

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,309
just fascinating listening to your talk

00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:53,260
before but how you made your agile team

00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:55,569
work and function and you know the way

00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:57,160
that you operate it in terms to live the

00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:58,809
elements of agile book and adding your

00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,490
own elements to make you successful for

00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:03,400
your context that is exactly what this

00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:04,750
is about find a way that works for you

00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,940
in your team even if it's slightly

00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:08,079
against the grain if it works for you go

00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,789
ahead and do it because you're gonna

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,210
produce more value and you're gonna step

00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:14,650
further ahead by doing it that way

00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:17,079
Stickle space I know we've talked a lot

00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,460
about person and environment today but

00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:20,650
if we think more holistically about

00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:23,319
office buildings for example we could

00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,119
start to reimagine the way his face is

00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:27,609
used so if we move away from hot desks

00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,930
and just loving a co-located team I've

00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:31,299
heard an increasing number of clients

00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:33,430
talk about having a single collaboration

00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:35,380
space where people will go into London

00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,630
or whichever city is going to pivi to do

00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,890
work together and aside from that you

00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:41,049
have they work from anywhere a tide

00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,609
mantra so really lose some significant

00:54:41,049 --> 00:54:45,640
changes of where their offices are laid

00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:47,589
out as far as technology is concerned a

00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,789
lot of technology to pieces but when it

00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:50,710
comes to doing this kind of work

00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,910
my mantra tends to be people it's all in

00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:54,460
that works and just get it done as

00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,809
quickly as possible I get frustrated by

00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,970
hanging on technology as the

00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:59,349
conversation points because to me it's

00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,039
an enabler it's not the end of the

00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:03,520
conversation

00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:05,049
so my steer on this is take the tooling

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,299
that you need to be able to fill your

00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:08,500
job try and make that a standard pattern

00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:10,450
across your team so you're all

00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:13,180
from the same hymn sheet and move

00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:14,530
forward and of course the final one is

00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,120
the one that we spent a significant

00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,680
amount of time talking to today and this

00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,720
is about the people within your team

00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,880
think about what it's like working with

00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,010
them today what you can do to change to

00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,600
really lift up people's moods start to

00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,760
spark and even understand when they are

00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,610
at the moment and then as we look to the

00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,950
future and hopefully you know reuniting

00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:35,050
with colleagues across the world in in

00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:37,150
hopefully not too distant future anyway

00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:38,310
let's think about what that relationship

00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,000
is going to look like in the future

00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:41,680
undoubtedly things are going to change

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,090
and you might not feel comfortable going

00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,440
up and giving that person a hug anymore

00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,090
but you would have done on a Monday

00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,860
morning what is the other thing you

00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:49,840
could do you know could you bring them a

00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,250
coffee from pret and leave it on the

00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,440
side just to show your token of

00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:57,400
appreciation to say it's good to see you

00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:59,700
again thank you very much for listening

00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,700
today

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,589
thank you very much Rob does anybody

00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:11,109
quickly before you move on does anybody

00:56:08,589 --> 00:56:15,030
have any questions do any of the other

00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:18,430
panelists have any questions for Rob

00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:20,380
yeah I actually have a question for you

00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:21,819
around this because I think it's very I

00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,160
think it's very important and very

00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:26,800
relevant to talk about what's the future

00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,790
of how things are gonna look and and I

00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,200
think some things will fundamentally

00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:34,900
change how have you ever had any

00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:38,560
experience with everything being remote

00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:41,560
and online recently with getting that

00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,240
kind of magical aha moment when people

00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,800
are kind of together when they're like

00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,150
working on a whiteboard together if you

00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,069
remember back in the day we were in the

00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:50,369
office people would work on a whiteboard

00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:53,369
together and you'd see that interaction

00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:56,319
happening have you in your experience

00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:58,569
managed to see or facilitate that same

00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,020
kind of feeling happening with everybody

00:56:58,569 --> 00:57:04,180
being remote yeah it is absolutely hard

00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,190
it's gets that point but getting that

00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,599
aha moment in workshops is absolutely

00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,000
key to the job that I do good day today

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,380
I think the most successful said I've

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,030
had done for this and this you know

00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:15,130
speech the tooling thing I just said

00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:17,470
before the one I tend to use is one

00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,849
called mural so it's quite cool me and

00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,980
all to jump in and jump at one around

00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:22,810
this big canvas so you can take people's

00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,609
thoughts here there and everywhere what

00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:26,770
a lot about it in particular is you can

00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:27,819
you can basically partition the topics

00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,230
that you want to talk to people about

00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:31,210
them and we always include something

00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,560
which is you know your thoughts or your

00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,599
feelings or something that's resonating

00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,819
with you as you go through so if you

00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:39,220
have like a jewel hat facilitator co

00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:40,839
facilitator role co facilitator can

00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,890
constantly keep on top of the comments

00:57:40,839 --> 00:57:43,810
people making about what's resonating

00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:45,700
and you can adjust the conversation on

00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:47,380
the fly and constantly John some things

00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,849
that people want to know about so if

00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,290
you're a little bit more sensitive to

00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:52,329
the mood in the room and what people

00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:55,690
want to talk about it tends to be either

00:57:52,329 --> 00:57:57,099
together our home open my mind okay

00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,810
that's an interesting one we literally

00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,730
hear it the zone we just started

00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:03,609
trialing we started a trial of mural

00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:06,819
today so yeah I'll give that a try yeah

00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:10,960
thanks I don't work from Europe

00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:14,250
otherwise I might give away that mural

00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,250
and not the White Sox either

00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:20,060
[Music]

00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:22,400
well thank you very much for for those

00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:25,100
it was really interesting in and I'm

00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,840
sure what you saying will will help many

00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:30,620
people in resonate with many people as

00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:35,690
well so the the final talk we have is

00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:38,780
from Nick Walker and I tech interested

00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:41,090
to hear his approach to agile principles

00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:43,100
and practices where he's been and so

00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,780
without further ado Nick I'll let you

00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:49,040
take over

00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:51,830
thank you I'm unfortunately I haven't

00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,270
got the baseball cap I have got a head

00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:54,560
back is like I think a lot of people

00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,900
have and I just have a haircut in the

00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:00,020
past three months so that's apologized

00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,970
over and as he's a bit of a tradition as

00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:05,210
well cheers everyone thank you for

00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:07,250
showing up tonight really appreciate the

00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:15,140
guys at TIG putting us all together so

00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:16,160
yeah here we go so we're here kind of

00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:19,310
talk about like why you're probably

00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:21,530
doing this right already so first of all

00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:23,540
I'm Nick Walker I'm here because I love

00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,490
to give presentations of course and from

00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:29,660
the safety of my own home it's even

00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:32,360
easier but I kind of want to focus on a

00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,680
little bit today is not just about some

00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,150
of the things that you know Robin and

00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,280
Jonathan that have been talking about

00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,380
but also how to develop you as a person

00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,390
like we're all agile ist's and something

00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,010
that I've spent a lot of time thinking

00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,090
about the past couple of years is I've

00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,480
kind of got into more leadership

00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:49,550
positions and and so on is how to help

00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:53,000
all of you become much better at what

00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:54,260
you do so you can find me an ego Walker

00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,490
and of course you can always stalk me on

00:59:54,260 --> 01:00:00,740
LinkedIn okay

00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:02,210
now the topic of agnostic hi-jon kind of

01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,470
why you are probably doing this or I

01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:06,080
already like why does that even matter

01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:07,550
like why are we talking about it so I

01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,880
want to share with you some some

01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:13,730
examples of things of why probably does

01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,520
matter so let's talk about jobs first of

01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:18,860
all now there is a bit of a silver

01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:21,590
lining I think sometimes to companies

01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:23,930
like mine fully remote and can recruit

01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,520
I'm sure there's a lot of people out

01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:26,470
there

01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,030
looking for new work so let's kind of

01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:29,800
imagine the scenario for a second that

01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:33,040
you're looking for a new scrum master

01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,810
job and you know your interpretation

01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,790
that was gone master it's a certain

01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:39,040
criteria but I was looking at LinkedIn

01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:42,070
today and I came across a couple of job

01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,650
specs the first one here taking a couple

01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:46,290
of first bullet points okay cool looks

01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:48,520
good right

01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:49,930
responsibilities yeah okay this is

01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,350
another one I litter I pulled the game a

01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:55,870
couple about what I want to be focus on

01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:58,090
is these two in particular one

01:00:55,870 --> 01:01:00,160
facilitate scrum events to be purposeful

01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:03,310
effective encourage continuous

01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,690
improvement second one responsibilities

01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:07,150
all planning around effectiveness

01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:08,980
repeatable sprinting for a long-running

01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:12,850
team primer that's been panning sprint

01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:13,900
ceremonies volunteer appointment and I

01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:15,430
appreciate you know some of the wording

01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,590
in there is kind of whatever but that

01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:20,350
essentially implies the you as that

01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:22,570
scrum master will be facilitating

01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:23,860
running those ceremonies and I think for

01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:27,730
a lot of us that would be pretty common

01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:29,830
right but if you look at scrum dawg

01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:31,180
and you look at the official what a

01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:33,370
scrum master does and what it does for

01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:36,100
development team so this is kind of the

01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:37,830
text taken from from the scrum dorg

01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,240
website you know the founders of scrum

01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:43,480
they talked about facilitating scribe

01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,980
ends and it's requested or needed kleban

01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,090
say it's a mandatory thing they don't

01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:49,930
say something that you should be doing

01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:51,430
as requested or needed I think it's a

01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:54,370
really important distinction to make how

01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:57,400
you know even something that is you know

01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:59,770
specifically called out as a specific

01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,200
job role such as scrum master has such a

01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:03,340
different distinction in terms of what

01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,160
it is going to do and what it isn't

01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:07,330
going to do and I think the reason why

01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,280
I'm kind of pointing this out you always

01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:11,170
because depending on your organization

01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,400
and the way that it defines what that

01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:15,040
job role is and what the job

01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,510
specification is it can massively change

01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:19,330
kind of actually how that kind of

01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:20,350
affects you all kind of customer impacts

01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:22,540
from the way that you're working your

01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:26,350
philosophy that your values just purely

01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:27,100
or something as simple as that so let's

01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:31,240
kind of think about some of the

01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:34,120
questions of why that has an impact what

01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:36,910
the expectations that hands-on roles

01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:39,700
hands off role do you facilitate do you

01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:43,850
coached you guy do you leave

01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:46,820
but what's actually important is it a

01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:49,160
process or an outcome in either of those

01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:51,740
first job specs did it talk about what

01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:53,660
the purpose or the why was you can have

01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:55,700
assimilate these ceremonies great

01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:59,540
they're going to be wonderful ceremonies

01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:02,000
and much like my kind of presentation

01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,170
fellows you know saying very similar

01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,430
things it's like what's it actually

01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:07,880
about like what is the kind of

01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:09,050
importance for this something that the

01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,530
kind of a baroque and I love this

01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:13,820
because it uses the word flaccid usually

01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,680
this would be the crowd and as Rob said

01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,390
you'd kind of hopefully engage a bit of

01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,460
a reaction and a bit of a laugh but

01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:21,260
there are many instances of flaccid

01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:23,030
scrum teams whether using the scrum

01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:24,640
vocabulary but weren't able to create a

01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:27,370
potentially shippable increment or

01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,840
functionality within a single spring I

01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:31,490
think that's really really important I

01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,260
think that that quote is lovely not just

01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:35,660
because of the flaccid part but because

01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,920
you've got a job spec where some of us

01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:39,200
will be going to apply for these jobs

01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,430
you have organizations that saying we're

01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,200
going to track this talent we're going

01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:43,730
to have these people that are going to

01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,160
be join us and they're going to do these

01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:47,750
things but actually don't necessarily

01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:52,670
mine up with the original intention of

01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:55,490
what it is but it's also about what they

01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:57,050
don't say something kind of as part of

01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:59,030
doing this talking you know having done

01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:00,920
this for for a long time now you know

01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:03,380
people look at the you know even the

01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,360
agile manifesto and you know millions of

01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:07,250
books and the you know dozens and dozens

01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:10,040
and dozens of organizations that provide

01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:12,110
training and how do this a lot of it is

01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:15,230
about what they don't say so will it

01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:18,910
kind of shake some some perceptions

01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:21,410
maybe and talk about scrum and Spotify

01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:23,210
so this is another thing is like when I

01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:25,310
wrote this I didn't kind of necessarily

01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:26,590
consider I can't have people's hands up

01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:29,990
so you have to come bear with me here

01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:32,690
but on scrum dork so this is Ken

01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:33,980
Schreiber and Jeff Sutherlands web sites

01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:36,410
debate for those that don't know or

01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:38,030
unfamiliar with the names they found in

01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,440
scrum they kind of came up with that Oh

01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:41,720
scrum and they make millions and

01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,420
millions of dollars kind of on this but

01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,740
they've got a community forum and I love

01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,440
this because I know it's into it it's

01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:49,970
something so so simple in the scrum

01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,620
guide it talks about the optimal

01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,100
development team being three to nine

01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,320
members

01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,730
I was talking to someone about this and

01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,610
they said it was seven plus or minus two

01:04:55,730 --> 01:05:00,800
and then I replied it's three to nine

01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:02,660
and apparently I was wrong because

01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,220
that's not what the guide says the guide

01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,930
says it should be this and I said this

01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:08,960
and I was told that it's wrong so what

01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:10,190
is the correct size for a team and it

01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,160
kind of made me chuckle a little bit

01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:15,440
because there's always that argument if

01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:17,000
like why does it even matter by why

01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,790
someone having the conversation about

01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,860
what size team works and what size team

01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:23,330
doesn't by an arbitrary rule that

01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:25,370
doesn't have the context of the problem

01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:26,810
they're trying to solve and again

01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:29,030
thinking about those job specs for a

01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:31,280
second it doesn't think about what the

01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:33,620
overall purpose is why do you need a

01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,750
team of plus or minus but seven plus and

01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:36,770
minus two in the first place it's

01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,510
because you're trying to do something

01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:40,310
really big is it because you're trying

01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:41,960
to meet a certain goal or an outcome

01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:43,970
who knows it's not even part of the

01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,470
conversation it's just an arbitrary rule

01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:47,600
because the guide says that you need to

01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:49,520
do this all you need to do that or you

01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:51,200
know Jeff Bezos says that you need to

01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,390
have you know teams that can be fed by

01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,160
you know no more than two pizzas like

01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:56,480
actually what's the context in that we

01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:00,110
kind of look at these things and and

01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:03,920
hold them up as this really almost

01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:05,290
biblical text that is kind of guiding us

01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,910
in the ways that we do things and

01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:09,650
actually even kind of here in the scrum

01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:11,390
dog website you've got someone having

01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:15,050
you know discussion about team sizes

01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:16,460
really really kind of odd but I also

01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,900
kind of know I mean I know that's gonna

01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:20,570
go quite well as I'm sure that many of

01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,980
you do but any guess is in - and again

01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:22,970
the ordinance participation thing is not

01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:25,660
going to work okay so I'm going to fit

01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:27,950
in for you but what is it not mention

01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:30,170
you think you scrum you kind of go yeah

01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,970
we run the scrum so many companies out

01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:34,700
there so yeah we're agile we run SCORM

01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:36,500
we do that we kind of we have stand-ups

01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:38,930
we have this we have that but did you

01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:41,570
know that in the scrum official scrum

01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:43,010
guide so if you go and trained by Jeff

01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:44,720
Sutherland who are known kind of spoker

01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:46,670
agile roundabout last year was was

01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,910
actually fantastic I've got huge amounts

01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:52,000
of admiration for him doesn't mention

01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:55,040
user stories once and the whole guide

01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,580
doesn't talk about user stories not in

01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:00,770
there it also doesn't mention velocity

01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:03,200
or any productivity metrics for that

01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:06,200
matter doesn't talk about them

01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,869
and yet I'm sure that many of you either

01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,849
through personal experience or talking

01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:14,119
with colleagues or anything like that

01:07:10,849 --> 01:07:15,530
will say yeah we run scrum where you go

01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:17,420
for an interview yeah we run scrum we're

01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:19,369
agile we have user stories that's part

01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,599
of your job spec that's part of the

01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,609
thing that we have and kind of the

01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:24,260
artifacts that you have and we talk

01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:27,319
about velocity we care about glossiness

01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:29,900
or scrum doesn't mention it but a good

01:07:27,319 --> 01:07:32,049
or a bad thing I'm not quite sure but

01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:35,140
what it does kind of highlight is that

01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:37,930
most the time that these guides or these

01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:40,430
you know official certifications these

01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:42,349
you know things that we kind of look to

01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:44,390
to help shape our teams and help show up

01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:45,230
the way that we worked don't necessarily

01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:47,270
have all the answers

01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:48,859
I'm much like I think both Rob and

01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:50,510
Jonathan are kind of alluded to you know

01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:51,770
bringing him in that mix-match of things

01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:53,569
but they're going to help us achieve

01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:54,980
this is actually the right way to do it

01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:58,240
and hence the kind of style that look

01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:00,170
you're probably doing this right already

01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:02,750
Spotify model I think is another

01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:04,940
fantastic example and it's something

01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:06,799
that I've been fortunate enough to have

01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:09,020
hands-on experience with you I've been

01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:11,210
to a few talks by people that you know

01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:14,780
we're agile coaches from the very early

01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:16,310
days of Spotify I've also met and spent

01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:17,960
time with Jimmy gentleman who is you

01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,759
know now selling you himself and and

01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,589
doing very very well as the consulting

01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,219
kind of places I'm sure you're all very

01:08:21,589 --> 01:08:26,120
familiar with a Spotify model

01:08:24,219 --> 01:08:28,250
essentially for those that don't know

01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,859
it's an organization and a management

01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:33,770
system for how we should be structured

01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:36,469
it talks about tribes squads chapters

01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:38,509
guilds as a way of organizing people

01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:41,900
around work and functions within a

01:08:38,509 --> 01:08:44,750
company for a lot of years it was very

01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:46,310
much considered to be the other gods

01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,960
atif is growing and scaling and it's

01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:50,449
doing wonderful and it's kind of going

01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:52,420
on to the stock exchange and people are

01:08:50,449 --> 01:08:55,130
making lots of money we should copy them

01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,420
and the Spotify model was kind of seen

01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,410
as one of those ways that they could do

01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:00,380
that because they published a white

01:08:57,410 --> 01:09:02,600
paper about it but here's a lovely quote

01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:05,449
from from York in Sunderland who's an

01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:08,330
agile coach from 2011 to 2017 at Spotify

01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:10,160
he said even at the time we wrote it we

01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:12,739
weren't doing it it was part of an

01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,179
ambition part of approximation people

01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:15,930
have really struggled to copy something

01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:18,120
that didn't really exist

01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:19,860
and I find that absolutely amazing and I

01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:22,170
said I've been fortunate enough to spend

01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:23,460
time with some people from Spotify and

01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,490
they've said this all along it was never

01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:28,800
intended to be something that people

01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,480
should copy it was meant to be something

01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,640
to attract talent and it was meant to be

01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,620
something to kind of let some light into

01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,420
what was going on inside the company and

01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:37,380
kind of exposed some of that and you

01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:42,600
know there are people out there that

01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:45,690
will sell you the Spotify model and it

01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,860
didn't take too much time to find kind

01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:48,090
of training institutes and I'm sure

01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:49,650
there's kind of many more consultants

01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:50,910
out there and and thankfully it's

01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:52,260
drifted off the past kind of couple

01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:54,020
years but there were people out there

01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:56,880
that will sell you this Spotify model

01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:59,340
yet you have people from Spotify some of

01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,230
which probably were quite instrumental

01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,640
in creating the model in the first place

01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,350
telling you that it's not something that

01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,420
you should do and there are consultants

01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:08,610
out there that will will sell you it I

01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,630
think definitely in the wrong wrong job

01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:14,670
for me because I'm sure they've been a

01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:16,920
 ton of money doing it were the two

01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:18,480
things that again code for two examples

01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,460
will give you is you know you've got

01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,680
this kind of scrum master job rollers

01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,900
that are coming about the scrum guide

01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,950
saying not necessarily the same thing

01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,720
and I realize that there's a bit of

01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:30,330
interpretation in that but kind of

01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:32,820
different things in there and then you

01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:35,280
have you know two very clear examples of

01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:37,470
something that you know sometimes get

01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:39,660
bundled together like scrum user stories

01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:41,880
velocity not the same doesn't actually

01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:43,140
it's not part of it Spotify model people

01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,120
look to it as a thing that they should

01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:47,640
be aspiring to trying to achieve trying

01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:51,030
to perfect not really a thing not

01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:53,100
something that people should be doing so

01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:55,620
probably why and one of the things where

01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:58,170
this is I want to you know back to my

01:10:55,620 --> 01:11:00,120
original point about why I want to push

01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:01,230
this point to all of you is I'm sure but

01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:03,600
for a lot of me you're probably doing

01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:05,610
this right already you are successful

01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,800
people with what you are doing you're

01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:10,650
you know doing very well you're kind of

01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,790
helping your team's achieve things but

01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,350
there's still that kind of strive and I

01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:15,270
see this in a lot of people I've

01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:16,800
interviewed dozens of people over the

01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,690
past months as my team is growing and

01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,450
you kind of meet people that talk about

01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:25,920
trying to perfect that process trying to

01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:27,720
perfect you know that methodology or

01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,100
framework because they've been 20 and

01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,030
really forget the essence of

01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,850
what this is all about in the first

01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:36,570
place it's about being contextual and

01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:39,240
agnostic I think but actually none of

01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:40,770
this matters for a second right because

01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,990
even me talking about all of this and

01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:45,030
preaching about how Spotify isn't right

01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:47,040
and scrum isn't right is feeding into

01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:48,930
all of that you know I'm talking about

01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,340
how Spotify eyes are seeing a lot of

01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,990
theory and scrum isn't seeing another

01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,970
thing and I'm actually kind of feeding

01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:58,170
into that because I'm not emphasizing

01:11:53,970 --> 01:12:00,600
what's important in the first place so

01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:02,160
this thing about this are you're helping

01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,770
your customers is your team delivering

01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,970
again the audience-participation thing I

01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:08,010
should have thought about this a lot

01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:09,750
more before I wrote it but I'm sure if I

01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:12,420
was to ask every single one of you face

01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:13,950
to face and say are you helping your

01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,960
customers are your team is your team

01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:19,140
delivering I'm fairly sure all of you

01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:21,390
and say yes because in some capacity you

01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:22,770
were helping make that happen and in

01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:25,590
some capacity you're achieving that

01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:27,210
whether it's fantastic or you kind of

01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:29,060
give yourself an 8 out of 10 9 out of 10

01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:31,830
10 out of 10 of how you're doing that

01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:35,010
different thing but are you helping your

01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:37,020
customers probably great wonderful is

01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:38,610
your team delivery yes it is we are

01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:41,670
delivering something could be better

01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:45,300
absolutely but are we delivering yes we

01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:47,750
are are you providing value and I think

01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:49,740
you know again kind of both my

01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,030
compatriots in kind of presenting say

01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,340
you know talking about that value is

01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:57,060
your business working you know are you

01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:59,190
hitting those KPIs okay as kind of

01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:02,580
whatever it is like are you working

01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:04,110
towards that yes probably in which case

01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,700
why are we going to get so wrapped up as

01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:10,260
kind of practitioners in our in our

01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:11,790
craft about why we're trying to strive

01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,890
towards scrum or why we're trying to

01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:15,180
drive strive towards they see that's

01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:17,610
really what I want to challenge all of

01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:19,440
you today to really think about what the

01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:21,390
essence is of what you're all actually

01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,680
doing and not only that but certainly

01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:25,080
you know as a question before about

01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:27,000
senior management what is it that we're

01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,500
trying to do what we're trying to

01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,240
provide value to customers we're trying

01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,470
to make a business successful well then

01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,630
why are we trying to hit certain

01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:35,880
methodologies will talk about scrum in

01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:37,740
certain ways it's about these things and

01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,490
you can achieve that in a million

01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:40,490
million different ways

01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:45,209
the state of agile 2020 I think is

01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,889
really a great report and I think what

01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:48,829
kind of a lead is some of these it's

01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:52,979
been going for about 14 years now and

01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:56,789
the the 2020 report came out earlier

01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:57,989
this year it talks about lost different

01:13:56,789 --> 01:13:59,489
things but one of the things it talks

01:13:57,989 --> 01:14:02,010
about is agile adoption some of the

01:13:59,489 --> 01:14:03,989
reasons behind that and so giving you

01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:06,419
all an idea this isn't just a kind of a

01:14:03,989 --> 01:14:08,699
small sample size it's about 40,000

01:14:06,419 --> 01:14:10,829
agile executives from practitioners you

01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:12,900
know across the globe primarily Europe

01:14:10,829 --> 01:14:16,559
and North America but also increasing

01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:18,329
the in Asia and but I really love this

01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:20,669
metric because it's how success is

01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,959
measured with agile project business

01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:25,229
finally deliver that customer user

01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:27,570
satisfaction 46 and 45% of people

01:14:25,229 --> 01:14:28,829
responded said that was the thing that

01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:31,469
we're using to measure successor

01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:34,590
projects it's amazing but third on the

01:14:31,469 --> 01:14:37,169
list unfortunately is velocity and he

01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:39,809
gives a about velocity like really

01:14:37,169 --> 01:14:41,729
it's a great metric to help make drive

01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:43,349
your team's and make me kind of help

01:14:41,729 --> 01:14:45,419
them understand the work a bit more but

01:14:43,349 --> 01:14:47,820
the essence of it business value

01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:49,469
delivered customer user satisfaction and

01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:51,539
that's how we should think about these

01:14:49,469 --> 01:14:53,639
things it should give us away from the

01:14:51,539 --> 01:14:56,309
idea that we have to follow scrum or

01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:57,959
scrum sayers or Spotify do this and we

01:14:56,309 --> 01:15:00,059
should follow Spotify because they've

01:14:57,959 --> 01:15:02,969
had success what's useful for us what's

01:15:00,059 --> 01:15:04,919
the context for us and how can we be

01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:09,209
agnostic in our approach to best achieve

01:15:04,919 --> 01:15:11,039
that so let's do something else as a

01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:12,809
group as I do our practitioners let's do

01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:15,479
something else because it's never going

01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:17,099
to be perfect and I think that I know

01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:19,860
that I personally suffer from this quite

01:15:17,099 --> 01:15:22,860
a lot is you know you kind of look for

01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:25,380
those absolutely perfect processes I've

01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:27,419
got this idea in my head I do a lovely

01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,530
kind of board and flow chart and it's

01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:29,999
going to look like this I'm gonna have

01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:31,709
all these aspects and things that's

01:15:29,999 --> 01:15:33,539
gonna happen and then two weeks in it

01:15:31,709 --> 01:15:35,729
doesn't work or something has to change

01:15:33,539 --> 01:15:37,979
or something kind of goes awry it will

01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:39,449
never be perfect but what actually is

01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:42,119
the point of you doing it in the first

01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:45,419
place to achieve that customer values to

01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:46,829
achieve you know business value is to

01:15:45,419 --> 01:15:48,689
please your customers is to make a

01:15:46,829 --> 01:15:49,559
difference to to those things that

01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:53,239
you're going to do that it's going to

01:15:49,559 --> 01:15:53,239
outline your kind of business's success

01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:58,190
one of the things and I've used this a

01:15:56,630 --> 01:16:02,300
couple of times never to use me favor

01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:04,790
you another bit because people may have

01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:06,830
probably heard about Kaizen it's the

01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:08,120
idea of you know continuous improvement

01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:10,160
but I really love this and I common

01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:12,620
where I found it from but I've kept up

01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:14,600
my desktop as kind of a quick quick

01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:16,070
referral but it's the idea of making the

01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,280
rule follow the rule improving the rule

01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:20,870
and you know I think Rob kind of refer

01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,370
to this is got or maybe Jonathan was

01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:23,900
talking about the agile manifesto and

01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:26,330
actually if you're looking there there

01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:27,560
is and the same with scrum it's not

01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:29,930
about what they say it's about what they

01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:32,810
don't say that flexibility that you have

01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:36,340
that autonomy that you have that context

01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:38,840
that you should try and follow about

01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,640
what it is you're trying to achieve and

01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,960
how you're going to achieve that and how

01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,490
you should continually adapt and

01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,500
innovate on the techniques and

01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:47,720
frameworks that you have and look not

01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,310
Ovilus are going to be lucky unfortunate

01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,740
enough to come up with a next spot afire

01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:53,660
model they know for as much as I kind of

01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:56,330
shittim it or or found a new methodology

01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:58,490
and have a huge industry behind it like

01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:59,960
scrum and the certifications that come

01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:02,720
and go with it and let me tell you that

01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,580
is a multi-million dollar industry but

01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,470
certainly for our context and we know

01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:08,450
this better than most people because

01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:11,720
we're the ones working in it what works

01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:13,610
for us what works for our customers how

01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:15,560
best we tie those two things together

01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:18,620
and actually I think that the idea of

01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,600
taking something following it improving

01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:23,720
it that's something that we should

01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,010
really kind of learn from so I want to

01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,290
kind of leave you with a with a kind of

01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:28,940
a few things that I think are really

01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:30,500
changing I kind of person like talks

01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:32,210
that are always very tangible towards

01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,860
the end so I'm gonna kind of leave you

01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:34,970
with these with these thoughts if there

01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,460
was ever a screen shot that you're gonna

01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:39,800
take this is it

01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:41,210
challenge when you all go away and I'm

01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,640
going to make sure that you challenge

01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:45,860
the people around you so when someone

01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,900
defines agile as a tool or a process or

01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:49,670
a framework or use the phrase or well

01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:51,320
scrum says or I read this ask all the

01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:53,660
Todd me this that the other I want you

01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,970
to challenge it we're going to make sure

01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:57,650
that you ask the question is that right

01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:59,390
for us is that right for our customers

01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:02,030
is that going to be the best way that

01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:05,000
we're able to do something

01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:07,520
when to learn our we need to keep

01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,260
attending meetups obviously our we need

01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,820
to read books watch videos take courses

01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:14,660
go to conferences I never want you to

01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:16,310
stop as our job practitioners about how

01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:18,730
you can learn how you can grow how you

01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:22,100
can keep innovating yourselves

01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:24,470
we need to experiment I want to try new

01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:26,840
figures are we need to innovate and I

01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:29,180
really and really know why one thing is

01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:31,160
better than the other one thing that I

01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:33,470
got challenged on quite recently and I

01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:35,660
thought this is it kind of certainly

01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:37,910
should my view is what can we estimate

01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:40,850
in time rather than estimating in story

01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:42,710
points and I was shocked I like the way

01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:44,420
you come like time is evil it's horrible

01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:46,640
my experience telling you this but

01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:49,130
actually if they were to experiment and

01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,110
one was better than the other like what

01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:52,640
if I'm wrong the kind of that

01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,780
experimentation and having you know

01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,610
proof is in the pudding I think he's

01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:56,840
very valid by having the data kind of

01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:59,420
behind it in trying different techniques

01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:01,520
you know to figure out what works for

01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:03,440
you in the context of your team in the

01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,900
context of your customers in the context

01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,850
of what you're trying to achieve don't

01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:12,920
kind of fit you know one size doesn't

01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:14,630
fit all certainly keep an open mind you

01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,100
may have your favorites but being open

01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:19,340
to other ways of doing things I think is

01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:21,560
incredibly important even in the you

01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:24,110
know state of agile kind of report it

01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:27,500
talks about how you know safe and scrum

01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:28,940
is kind of 80 to 85 percent of the

01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:31,550
overall respondents preferred

01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:34,450
methodology you know that means there's

01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:37,340
something but it means are they

01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:38,930
identifying as scrum but what if there's

01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,970
something better or if there's a

01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:41,990
tweaking there that they have made and

01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:45,140
they're not kind of coining it out

01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:46,880
because they're too afraid of being you

01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:49,280
know not fitting that checkbox on the

01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:51,680
record of report I'm really interesting

01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,300
so keep an open mind think about the

01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:56,000
different things that are going on think

01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:58,310
about the opportunities that you have be

01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,530
agnostic I think this is probably the

01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:02,360
the most important one for this is agile

01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:04,820
as a culture and a philosophy and it's

01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:06,860
ultimately a set of values if you think

01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:08,990
about the original agile manifesto is a

01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:11,380
series of values it doesn't talk about

01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:14,060
any specific methodology and that

01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:15,560
ultimately implies that there are lots

01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:17,210
of different ways of being outed

01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,100
and it should be about the context that

01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:20,600
you're in there are lots of ways to

01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,750
achieve the things that you're trying to

01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:27,530
achieve don't be limited by a single

01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:28,940
methodology or more and lastly and

01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:32,480
probably equally as important as the

01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:33,950
last one think about the context what

01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,810
does your team need what does your

01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:37,520
company need but most importantly what

01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:40,250
does your customer need and how best can

01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:42,890
you achieve that something that it took

01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:45,080
me quite a few years after discovering

01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:46,850
you know agile and scrum and Kanban and

01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,230
lean and you know all the other kind of

01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:51,890
wonderful methodologies that we're all

01:20:48,230 --> 01:20:53,930
here kind of around about you know was

01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:55,910
there is a place for waterfall there are

01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:57,680
projects that waterfall is more suited

01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:59,780
to and actually there are things that I

01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:01,670
can take from waterfall and scrum and

01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:03,560
agile and motor them all together and

01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:06,110
find a really incredible way of doing

01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:08,180
things but I didn't think about the

01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:09,980
context for quite a few years was I oh

01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:11,930
no I can't I can't use that it's it's

01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:13,850
old it's horrible it's nasty like we

01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:15,740
don't do that anymore we're jar but it's

01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:17,360
kind of feeding into that thing of you

01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:19,610
know perception rather than about need

01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:22,460
and about context so think about your

01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:25,280
context what it's going to change

01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:26,990
between now and in six months time in

01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,670
six months time you shouldn't be doing

01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:30,020
the same thing anymore should be

01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:32,150
different because you're certainly not

01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:34,100
working on the same thing your customers

01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:38,870
have evolved and change and their needs

01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:40,610
have changed why haven't you changed and

01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:44,140
lastly I want you all to think about

01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:46,280
your skills as very much as a toolbox

01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:48,920
how do you build it and how do you use

01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:51,740
it one of the analogies that I love to

01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:54,410
use come upon people the kind of part of

01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,010
my team is you know imagine you've got a

01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,270
toolbox

01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:59,540
you've got wrenches you've got hammers

01:21:56,270 --> 01:22:02,270
you know the kind of these evades lean

01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,490
scrum agile waterfall kind of whatever

01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:05,960
it is how do you use them and how do you

01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:08,540
gain that experience and how do you keep

01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:10,580
filling your toolbox because the context

01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:12,680
is always going to change change is

01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:14,390
always going to come so how can you

01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:16,580
always kind of keep that toolbox full

01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:19,730
how can you try new things and how can

01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:22,190
you keep evolving that think about your

01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:24,690
skill set very much as a toolbox and how

01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:27,250
you keep building

01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:30,910
thank you very much so I think that's me

01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:34,330
too busy so I'll stop talking now and

01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:35,710
pass over to Jonathan thanks thank you

01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:37,719
definitely promoting some healthy

01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:42,969
discussions in the in the chat I was

01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:44,650
really--it so by the way other panelists

01:22:42,969 --> 01:22:46,719
if you want to jump in at any point and

01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:48,969
ask some questions and but we have a

01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,920
question from Hamid he thinks do you

01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:53,500
think agile is still relevant in the age

01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:56,739
of scrum yeah absolutely

01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:59,710
I think agile if you imagine in your

01:22:56,739 --> 01:23:03,219
head kind of like the layers our job is

01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:07,090
at the very bottom it's that philosophy

01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:08,710
the philosophy values the frameworks

01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:10,719
that layer on top are the ways that you

01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:15,100
achieve that and I think that that

01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:17,020
bedrock of agile customer first know

01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,880
thinking about value and even match that

01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:21,489
original quote about you know flaccid

01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,710
scrum you know the emphasis in there is

01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:25,270
not about necessary the process and

01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:28,560
doing the process wrong so although I'm

01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:30,400
sure it was definitely a way of you know

01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,699
ensuring that there was plenty of people

01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:35,980
that signed up to scrum training courses

01:23:32,699 --> 01:23:37,840
but the emphasis in there is about the

01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:39,100
customer the value that you deliver the

01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,199
iterations that usually the

01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:43,390
experimentation so absolutely I think

01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:48,190
agile the core of it is that's what it's

01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:50,170
representing so yeah I really do and

01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:52,150
just before we wrap up just wanna make

01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:53,860
sure and no more questions do any of the

01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:59,320
panelists have any questions I just met

01:23:53,860 --> 01:24:01,660
I could throw one question out there for

01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:05,890
you Nick is you know with a lot of those

01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:08,020
types of practices that get that are out

01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:11,680
there like for example story points I

01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:15,070
often with a lot of organizations run

01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,900
into where where many organizations want

01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:19,810
to start codifying these things like

01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:22,210
story points or our scrum or certain

01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:23,830
things as a matter of corporate policy

01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:26,560
to say oh let's standardize a story

01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:30,070
point or let's say all teams must have a

01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,750
daily stand-up or things like that how

01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:34,020
in your experience have you kind of

01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:37,190
coach two organizations away from

01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:41,630
codifying those practices as a mat

01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:47,770
of corporate policy I also very pressure

01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:47,770
is something that comes up a lot alike

01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:55,070
what's minimum and that when you kind of

01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:57,260
build meetings and I'm fortunate enough

01:24:55,070 --> 01:25:00,830
to work at a company that isn't in a

01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:02,510
very strong arena of growth of the

01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:04,400
moment so what we're kind of building

01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:06,620
new teams and we kind of build those

01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:09,590
who's that like what is minimum yeah

01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:11,480
think about well is that user stories is

01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:14,090
that this is it that how do we kind of

01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,469
codify some of those things but it's

01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:17,360
very much I think the intention and the

01:25:15,469 --> 01:25:19,250
motivation behind it like is it a

01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,560
bedrock kind of foundation to involve

01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:23,570
from you know is that way than the place

01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:25,010
to kind of get started from and I think

01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:27,590
he's about that kind of culture and

01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:29,900
motivation around it but kind of hinges

01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:31,670
for that so in some companies that have

01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:33,199
worked in the past and so now as we go

01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:35,000
now we think about what's the minimum

01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:38,330
that you start from and then how do you

01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,920
evolve from that and I think that you

01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:41,360
know ultimately at the core of it always

01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,860
what's going to work for the customer

01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,510
well we know these kind of things work

01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:46,400
because that's the cadence and scale and

01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:48,800
kind of so on but also it's about that

01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:52,449
customer and forcing that contextual

01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:56,870
change really helps to shake off that

01:25:52,449 --> 01:25:59,840
being kind of stuck on things so I think

01:25:56,870 --> 01:26:01,969
in summary it's about what's your

01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,980
minimum what kind of works what doesn't

01:26:01,969 --> 01:26:06,230
work does that fit into your you know

01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,930
cadence rhythm governance kind of pick

01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:10,760
your poison for a language for the

01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:13,790
company how do you make decisions for

01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:15,560
example you know but then after that I

01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:17,360
think it's about how do you get the leg

01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,580
up for teams you how'd you get them

01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,560
started and then post that how do you

01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:23,660
keep the you know culture of innovation

01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:26,300
and culture of change you know think

01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:29,750
about context how do you kind of put

01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:32,300
that into all the teams so it's almost

01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:36,580
like to kinda have a play a play on the

01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:39,040
term a Minimum Viable process as it were

01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:42,620
absolutely it's interesting because

01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:44,930
you're Kim who I met before talks about

01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:47,630
the idea of Minimum Viable angel' or

01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:49,880
been a bit a lot viable process yeah I

01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:50,810
think you know if we were to be really

01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,060
honest with ourselves

01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:55,310
for a second there is minimums you know

01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:57,320
the idea of autonomy I think is a really

01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:58,850
interesting one because you know a lot

01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,830
of teams and a lot of people aren't set

01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:03,260
up to the autonomous they're not capable

01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:04,640
of doing it so how about we give them a

01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,360
helping hand and say but here's where

01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,040
you start from

01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,220
and then you evolve from there because

01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:11,420
you'll understand the context of oh I

01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:13,700
totally believe in the idea of kind of a

01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:17,240
minimum agile I mean in process

01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:19,280
certainly yeah makes it strip it down

01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:21,230
strip it down to its core fundamentals

01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:27,140
and then layer on what you need yeah

01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:30,110
yeah it's a good approach cool well I

01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:32,660
just want to say a big big thank you to

01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:36,400

01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:48,860
