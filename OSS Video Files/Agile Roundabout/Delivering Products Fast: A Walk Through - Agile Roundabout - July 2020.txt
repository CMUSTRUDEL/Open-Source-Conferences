	00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,520
so just a quick one about me i work

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,080
within shells digital

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,720
uh department so it's a horizontal where

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,280
we

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,320
we build products we effectively uh opt

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,639
to go ahead

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,639
and um implement some of the best

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,119
practices on the market hopefully

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,160
um in order to deliver transformational

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,119
projects across

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,960
our retail businesses our upstream

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,000
businesses and other areas

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,359
my specific role is i usually

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,119
i'm giving a brief a opportunity where

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,320
then i have to shape the product with

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
the team

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,520
working with traditional product owners

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,680
and different parts of the business

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,040
to bring those on this journey where we

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,520
go from an idea

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,879
to rata verifying the idea using lean

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
startup principles

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,079
and then actually delivering the idea

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,559
whether it's an mvp

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,920
or or more most of the time it's a

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,280
minimum viable product

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,960
because we want to ascertain whether

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,920
it's worth investing or not investing in

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,280
this product

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,520
i've been michelle for a little while

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,600
but prior to this had a few startups too

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,920
and i'm glad to have you on this call

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000

other today but

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,120
it looks like we've gotten quite a few

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
people in the session so on screen i'm

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
gonna ask for a quick

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,760
ask to be followed could you just do

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
that really quickly

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,519
and then i've summoned everyone i've got

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
23 people following me awesome

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,720
so here's your first challenge it's

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
really simple challenge you've got a

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
question in front of you that says how

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
did your team

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,480
get through out is getting through covid

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,879
specifically

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,160
in terms of ways of working teamwork

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,120
it'd just be good to understand from

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
your perspective

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
the way to work this if i give you an

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,680
example ticket and sticky note is that

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,239
if i go

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,159
example here you can see that i've just

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,599
typed into one of the sticky notes

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,280
the other way you create a sticky note

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,599
is you double click on screen

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,000
it creates one you can change the change

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,840
the color as well but your challenge

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,640
strengths that is

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,280
that's important um check-ins during

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
retros

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,720
checking moods team yep check-ins have

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,879
always been important

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
but how did you get through it i mean

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,840
we're not saying we're fully through

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,280
this by any means but

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,640
um maybe through the harder period where

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,840
we had more stringent lockdown

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,840
particularly in the uk

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,360

if you could go into a little bit more

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,840
on that one um i think it's the brown

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,080
see a bit of our method see see a bit of

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,600
some of the key tools and techniques

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,919
okay so on that note i'm going to close

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,080
the mural and john can i just do a quick

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,919
check in can you now see

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
the support page or any of the

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,319
presenters in front of you the support

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,080
page

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,759
i can see the support page yes

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,039
phenomenal so why don't we start off

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,240
with story the story here

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,840
is it's the retail chat bot so january

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
early this year where everything seemed

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,800
to be

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,240
economically fine we went ahead and we

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,440
were given the task of saying right can

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
you create a chatbot

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
we can help us optimize our

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,360
conversations with our customers

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,960
so in particular we have this zendesk

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
widget on most of our websites

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
we wanted to automate some of the

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,080
responses the reason

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
being is that to alleviate our customer

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,360
customer operation specialist

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
and automate those things that keep

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
getting asked but in addition to this

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
start to have more meaningful

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
conversations with the customer

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
so let me talk you through what we

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,560
actually built let's go through a demo

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,160
in about three four minutes

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
um on the bottom right corner when you

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,800
get to the shell.support.com page

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,840
uh you can go to help but most of the

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,639
time customers

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,960
go and click on chat so in this instance

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
what

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,479
i'm gonna do is i'm gonna type in my

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,039
name i'm going to type in

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,800
my email address for work and i'm going

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,680
to say i'm having login issues

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,440
which seems to be one of the key

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,400
questions asked particularly on a shell

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,479
go plus app

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,319
it's a nominal app please do download it

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,160
if you get a chance as well

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
so let's talk you through what happens

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,840
the reachal virtual assistant turns

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,879
around say hello i'm the shield retail

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
virtual assistant

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,080
i'm here to help you with any other

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,520
questions that you may have regarding

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
shell uk products

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,680
services and go plus program have you

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
created an account yes i've created an

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
account

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
so let's see what happens next one of

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,479
the things you've noticed as well

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,479
is that there's a slight delay in the

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,599
response time to mimic a human being

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,400
typing

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,240
so retail virtual assistant says thank

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,639
you this may be a password issue

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,919
just to reset simply forgot password

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,800
you'll receive an email with

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,039
instructions

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,320
on how to change does this help yes

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,919
actually it does help

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,599
because it was a password issue i've

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,560
gone to reset button i just forgot how

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,320
to do that

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,919
so let's see what happens next great can

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
i help you with anything else

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
i'm gonna say no but i wanted to show

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,120
you one of the most important

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,720
features for us throughout the entire

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,200
process which should be happening

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,320
in a second

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,440
that's right this was it how do you rate

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,720
your experience with our virtual

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,160
assistants

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
because if you don't have a way in a

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,800
mechanism to gauge the

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,800
the results of your particular product

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,839
then sometimes you you're a bit lost in

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,600
all the data

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,600
that's the end of that let's pivot over

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,519
to effectively

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,760
uh the retail chat bot this is going to

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,800
go through the story of how we started

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,880
who is involved

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,440
on a high level project plan something

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,959
that's been fairly anonymized to be

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,240
the big parts of if you're creating a

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,920
chatbot project what you're going to

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,120
need

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,560
so as you can see we started in january

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,040
and then we went down to the bottom

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,440
right in

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,120
in june the team consisted of myself an

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,000
innovation lead our product we had two

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,399
product owners

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
because we had a co co caps one was more

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,880
of a

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
actually a hands-on specialist one had a

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,399
broader view of what needed to happen so

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,959
that was a challenge but

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
definitely definitely worked well we

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,680
decided to run

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
simply a weekly sprint so we wanted to

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,920
keep the intensity up quite high

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,360
in terms of tooling we just used a jira

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,519
big fan of jira

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,120
in teams of cadence we met every day for

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,200
15 to 30 minutes

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,040
and strictly adhering to the stand-up

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,760
stand up but also having a laugh and a

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
joke

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040
um through the journey when when we were

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,040
doing this we

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,800
first of all we needed to figure out

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
what faqs do we automate

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,399
um so having been traditionally trained

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,640
as a pm

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,920
but an absolute advocate of a job at the

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,920
same time someone who loves

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,279
lean startup i like to blend tools and

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
techniques so

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,279
what was scope we understood one of the

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,200
data points what the questions

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,360
that we wanted to automate based on

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,240
actual data that we pulled out from the

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
system to say

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,760
it's these questions this is the volume

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,480
we prioritize that way

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,600
then we went ahead and we got got on

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,519
board a customer

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,839
journey specialist you talk through how

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
do you actually respond to someone

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,040
because linguistically it's quite a

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,680
challenge then we

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,440
effectively wrote these down but then

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
when we got to about february and march

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
this is where we started to see

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,560
challenges particularly in our project

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,240
team what i mean by that is when covid

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
hit

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,320
we had resources and wanted to say

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,399
resources is a bad word we had people

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,800
and friends and family

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,320
go off sick and myself included i was

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160
off sick for five weeks

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,079
and what i saw was a tremendous effort

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,399
from the team what happened is that

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,160
we've

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,920
created a jovial environment where we

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,640
spoke on it work

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,440
or we had our other social groups um

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,360
when we could

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,959
we could talk purely about how we're

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
doing what's going on and that helped

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,880
because when someone went

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,640
offline or needed support it's almost as

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,399
if the other team members in fact not

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,560
all messes if the other team members

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,079
went and filled that gap immediately and

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,680
i can't explain to you that is one of

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,959
the holy grails for anyone in the

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,880
project team to be like

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,040
without friction they step in with their

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,720
skill sets we talk about having a broad

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,519
array of skill sets but we did do that

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
analysis

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,560
on who's in the team what they can do

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,320
ahead of time

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,839
it's really helped us actually say if we

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,639
have a gap someone else can come in

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,320
quickly

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,760
which is something that we try to do

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
project to project now

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,160
then in addition to that we did we spoke

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,760
to the stakeholders and

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
particularly the customers of this who

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
are sponsoring this project and they

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,839
were very supportive too they said

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
we understand your situation but really

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,959
it was

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,120
the morale the morale took a hit and the

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,720
morale was jovial at the beginning but

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,079
the morale was a bit more like

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,760
we're trying to get through effectively

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,399
what sometimes people call the grind of

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,800
a project

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,519
to get this project out and it was

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,279
brilliant

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,639
people spoke to each other supported

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,800
used positive language

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,880
in addition to this adhere to shell has

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,880
a very strong culture around

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
honesty integrity and respect and i'm

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,240
happy to say that

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,160
everyone exuberated this it was fun as

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,120
well this was a new challenge for us and

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,360
everyone was willing to chip

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,240
in how they specifically did that was

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
that they

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,839
they made jokes sometimes they they made

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,360
sure that if we were going through a

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,560
stressful period that we didn't put too

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
much pressure on anyone

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,000
we didn't manufacture deadlines and we

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,800
made sure that

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
if we needed flexibility in cost quality

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
or

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
or when it came to time we could speak

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,880
to our stakeholders and engage them

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,399
one thing that we did do and a specific

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
that i would definitely recommend

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,600
is we try to communicate communicate

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,160
communicate

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
so no one was left in the dark until the

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,120
last moment it was more like

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,560
this is our progress along the way

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,440
whether that's an email

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,000
a quick yammer post or other any other

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
of our

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320
internal social media platforms so i can

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,399
as you can see those were the main

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,120
challenges along january february march

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,839
april then we got to effectively the

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,920
technical

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
technical construction of this project

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
where we took it from an idea

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,800
its test environment to really now

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,560
refining it

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,399
i have to say chat bots are by far one

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,240
of the most iterative products i've

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,079
ever worked on it went through about

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,079
literally six iterations

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,440
so you create the the language you

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,440
create what you think is the right

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,480
response and then you test and you test

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,880
and you test

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
i'm very much an advocate of build

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,760
measure learn

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
but at the same time we needed to learn

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,760
measure and then build

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,360
and and repeat this pattern six times

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,880
the team were energized

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
but in addition to this story then

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,959
prevails into we

00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,680
we moved into getting the effectively

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,279
the wrapper

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,440
around the technology it's ready for

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,560
production towards april may

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,240
um we had less people because people

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,320
were being impacted by covert

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,079
and in addition to this we had a a

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,279
globally dispersed team we had people

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,560
over in the philippines

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,240
we had uk we had um we had

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
quite a few different time zones as well

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,959
we had china as well just trying to

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,440
remind myself

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,480
but it was absolutely amazing to see

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,079
people go through

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
these particular challenges and get

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,680
through get through to

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,279
releasing the product that you see now

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,160
one thing i'd say is that the products

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,320
never finished

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,160
with this particular product is going to

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,959
take numerous iterations now in

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,360
production

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,639
to get it better and better and better

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,279
but one thing that we did

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,079
put in place was our key metrics so

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,000
during the project

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,000
it was weeks to launch then it was

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,560
number the deflection rate from the chat

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
bar

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,040
and we have a few other key killer kpis

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,120
that we adhere to and no joke we

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
actually measure on a daily basis

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
we have the analytics off the back of

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,519
the chat board that tell us what works

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
and what doesn't

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,000
and i could only advocate this same

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,160
approach this analytical and lean and

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,079
lean analytics mindset to every single

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,320
product we release

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,160
getting feedback means we can improve

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,440
iterate and move forward

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,399
so on a personal note um how did i feel

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,000
through this as

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,320
the agile project manager or just a

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,920
teammate

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,079
it was challenging because you think to

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,040
yourself what else could go wrong

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,040
but respectfully that's when you have to

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,880
to mature and say right

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,320
well what are the risks that could occur

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,800
and how do we mitigate them

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,120
i look to the design sprint from napsy

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,959
where he does this how might we moments

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,959
and that's how we create a lot of our

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,759
risk registers continuously and that

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,680
really helped

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,440
so it said how might we how might we but

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
there's some things that you just can't

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,199
and can't prepare for so one thing i

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
definitely say is

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,120
create camaraderie so camaraderie don't

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
force it either

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,800
it needs to be something that you can

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,279
generally gel on have sessions that you

00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
can

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,560
you can sit back and relax and not speak

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,560
about work about

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,560
um make sure the in the diary and make

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,160
them different you have questionnaires i

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,199
saw some great ideas as well that i've

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,199
got to participate

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,560
and and try as well but also at the same

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,399
time don't lose

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,839
make sure everyone's focused on that one

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
goal whether it's the launch of the

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,199
product

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,800
product or whatever it may be um one of

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,120
the key things as well just to mention

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,399
here

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,120
is is don't try and break break

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,160
individuals

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,920
by putting too many deadlines on them

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,079
um i've seen this happen multiple times

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,160
so one of my advices to that is

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,680
do what's realistic and use that term

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,399
it's realistic to deliver this

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,560
particular

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,160
product in this time frame and i'll

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,120
probably just end on this which i know

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,120
this has been a

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,480
crazy journey you've seen the mural

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,399
you've seen the the product

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,320
but what are my three takeaways for you

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,480
it's definitely got to be is

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,759
morale make sure you keep that high in

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,120
any way that you see

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,279
see is important you're going to get

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,360
energizers in the team we had some

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,959
some absolutely amazing focus in the

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,839
philippines that came they sent gifts

00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
they spent

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,839
emojis it was great to have that

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,279
environment at the same time don't lose

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,679
focus of your main goal

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,319
and the third thing is make sure that if

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,360
you have people that go off sick

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,760
empathize empathize and respect

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,280
whatever whatever tool you're using to

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,319
deliver a project

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,480
agile lean um

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,400
it doesn't matter about the process it

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,360
matters about the people and taking care

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,600
of them

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,640
and with that we got to the end and it

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,160
was one of our

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,080
one of the projects that went live

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
through covid and i'm happy to say is

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,919
has been a fairly big success for us in

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,240
this area um with that

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,039
i think i've i've spoken enough and good

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,320
to open up

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,039
yep good um cool yeah and thank you for

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,440
that so we've got

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
got a few questions um so the first one

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,240
from from sarah

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,919
and she asked how did you manage the

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,039
workload and stand-ups

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,360
and communication from uh from with

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,919
people from different regions

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,600
so stand-ups uh we worked a time zone so

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,760
we did a time zone calendar

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,760
um we had people in the philippines so

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,200
um we tried to do it early uk time

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,880
we had someone in china so we also

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,320
married up the east to the west

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,240
uh so we i had to do a bit of that

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,960
analysis on paper quickly just a quick

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,200
google

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,320
and then and get that sorted sorry john

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
could you break me into the second and

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,720
third parts of that question as well

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,919
please is that all right

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,039
yeah so um manage workload

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
and stand-ups and communication okay

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,640
stand up

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,520
stand-ups um so i love the train the

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
trainer approach

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,840
um we kept it 15 to most of the time

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,679
we're done in 15 minutes in fact i'd say

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,919
four out of five days a week we are

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,200
um probably on a friday we have 15

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,880
minutes extra

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,240
managing i tell you before we started

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,360
the project we had a lot of people that

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,120
were new to agile

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,679
so we spent two or three hours just

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,440
showing them what stand up looks like

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,600
and getting them trained but one thing i

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,799
found very useful practical guide

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,960
is the rotation of facilitators so

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,080
empowering people to go ahead and ask

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,039
those three questions

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,760
and and really let them feel like

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,960
they're in the lead

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,360
it shouldn't always be one voice um

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,520
i think that's in terms of workload it

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,960
was we always made sure that we

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,120
we basically did midweek backlog checks

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,200
and with it being just a weekly sprint

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
it was quite easy to have transparency

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
on that i found sometimes when you work

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,520
break into two three

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,200
three week sprints it can be it can be

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,320
challenging it is useful and it does

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,240
work but

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,919
we were very specific we made sure we

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,559
use our user stories but at the same

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,039
time

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,000
when we didn't need user stories we had

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,000
legible

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,400
um tickets that made sense with

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,840
acceptance criteria that made sense too

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,360
um i'd say make sure your grooming spot

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,360
is just spend time in these areas

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,640
the next question we have is from

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,200
madeleine she asks as the ac did you

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,520
feel

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,640
more of a responsibility to keep up

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,400
morale

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,320
yes yeah 100 you burn

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,440
the shoulder of this thing you feel

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
almost

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,760
you're an emotional roller coaster all

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,039
the time um

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,720
so yes in short you have your highs are

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,000
the team's highs your lows are

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,200
the team's lows i like to be emotionally

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,679
invested in the team

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
i don't like the a robotic approach

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,880
because it means i'm passionate and i

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,559
really want to drive this through

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,159
not saying that approach is correct but

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,960
it you've got to understand different

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,039
people's

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,880
personality types too and i actually

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,760
advocate that it's okay to show when

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,679
you're sad

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,360
yeah i'm not angry we don't we don't

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,520
advocate that kind of behavior but

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,440
to show if you're sad then people can

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,760
appreciate that and have you back in

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
and also just to ask open questions so

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,200
when you say check-ins it's not just a

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
tick box exercise

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,880
we know we ended up knowing about each

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,919
other's personal life especially through

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,480
this as well

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,280
um how we regulated that though is to

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,039
make sure that

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,120
on paper we also had people that could

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,000
back us up so if i went on leave

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,720
vice verse or vice versa or on different

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,640
areas

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,559
it was the handshakes to say yeah this

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,480
person is has her back

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,000
and what was powerful is that we have a

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,720
lot of team members

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,760
that could guide a project work in the

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
project

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,039
um they have skill sets that are

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,799
specific to them as well

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,960
so i used to be a developer a business

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,240
analyst i like to be a pm

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,919
that's my specialism i'd say but what we

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,720
see is that other specialisms

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,960
have a broad base of other activities so

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,480
no one person felt overburdened we could

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,679
democratize quite a bit

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,120
and that's something that we are

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,799
particularly selective of when we're

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,320
starting off projects

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,200
um cool anything else i just typed

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,080
in actually um i i was curious after um

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,559
i know that zendesk for example

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,200
i know the zendesk um have their own

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,799
chat

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,640
stuff built in for example we use

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,799
zendesk myself so i just wondered how

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,480
if you went for like a kind of pre built

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,360
versus buy and how you decided whether

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,280
to kind of

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,280
build out yourself versus sort of

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,440
reusing existing components and

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,320
stuff like that it's a good question um

00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,919
so i'll take two

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,520
two lenses i'll take a technical and a

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,240
commercial end really quickly

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,600
uh we had a architect technically assess

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,240
the feasibility of three

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,200
major options two we had a few internal

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,799
through external

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,039
they just did a pros and cons list to

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,120
understand what would be beneficial

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,799
then we did a cost-benefit analysis to

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
understand then based if this is the

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,200
best one

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,120
then is the return really going to be

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,880
worth it and that's how we came to our

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,600
conclusion we kept it quite empirical

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,600
but

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,880
yeah and it helped that we had existing

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,880
